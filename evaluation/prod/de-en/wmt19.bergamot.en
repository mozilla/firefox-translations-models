DFB boss Grindel does not see any basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel does not currently see the basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on talking about once talking, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt one or the other as it is laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "phrase mowers" of the "image newspaper.
Despite the months of debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain point that this would be so," said Grindel.
In July, De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team and justified the latter by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come about."
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 14.13 a.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the allotment vineyard settlement, danger was in arrival.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when they found.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and burn debris had to be cleared out to the extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had attached a battery to charge at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as does the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collector's items in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Defend Herself: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on the Sun
What did Lindsay Lohan drive to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") himself streamed live, as they apparently want to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and releases a partial recording of the stream.
See "Surkyly kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan leaves a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that they want to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues his parents and their children.
It accuses adults of child trafficking.
She does not provide any evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is looking at this," Lohan can be heard in the video how they continue to pursue the family along the street.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough of the obvious mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan is giving a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" started in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: Number of deaths in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 victims.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet reached the areas that are cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board chief
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a retreat by the electric motor builder.
The US stock exchange supervisors sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is withdrawing from the supervisory board, but he may remain chairman of the board.
British Conservative Congress
Sharply guarded - the Party Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is intended to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront, former Secretary of State Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called northern Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore at the head in the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer of the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
The imprisoned and leave of absence, Audi head Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the Task Force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be examined," he said at the time.
Mertens said now: "At the beginning of July, we have reached an important milestone in the reappraisal of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi parent Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to continue discussing this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust emission values after the exhaust gas fraud became known.
He knew or deliberately ignored them of the manipulations.
Bram Schot is currently heading the company as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption testing standard, there were production downtimes at Audi, said the "Heilbronn Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for saloons such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shoe relies on electromobility.
15,000 reservations were already available for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel aims for re-election - Lahm to be included in the DFB Executive Committee
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for position as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as much as it works," said Grindel as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try for re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "have a lot of participation in the future project after the award for the 2024 European Football Championship".
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, which was overthrown over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the fall of 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote will be taken at the DFB Federal Day on 27 June September 2019 to.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to be involved in the DFB Executive Committee.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Executive Board agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the presence committee in the future and will then of course be cordially invited to provide his experience with sporting questions," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculations whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become integration ambassador of the DFB in the future.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If an unlimited background of a migration background has a significant impact on society and football and says, "the topic is important, we have to worry about it," which would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Correct removal with semi-clever scale
I have owned a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
Also, muscle and bone mass can indicate them.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but it is more for the voucher.
After all, he does not say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Bundesliga with a clear victory.
The runner-up won against Science City Jena without any problems with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game for over 40 minutes.
New sign Rokas Giedraitis was the dominant Berliner with 20 points top scorer.
The international Johannes Thiemann (18 counter), who was engaged in Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his competitive debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the competitive match debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 points.
Last year's semi-final playoff player MHP giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most unpacked shooter at the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings towers over with 25 points at the Oldenburgers.
The Braunschweig-based company, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority shareholder since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoan opens mosque in Cologne
The Danish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, he had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo'an called on the German government to hand over supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
Cologne city centre had been partially closed to the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand policemen were involved - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is under criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, shouts and shoutings
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to fighting poverty and illness at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Comitate wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival at the night of Sunday in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations also showed themselves on stage in the spectacle of several hours.
In between, however, there was a sightseeing way when many spectators thought the sound of a surrounding metal shut-off for shots, became afraid and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people would run away.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin then reassured people from the stage.
"Nobody tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - buhrufe for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coon, he spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
However, on Friday, Flake had come out in the Judicial Committee of the U.S. Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thus alienating many women from the head.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women, who had experienced sexual assault themselves, who had self-stricken sexual assaults, faced him on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said at the concert in New York on the crowd.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends journalist's throwaway
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had switched over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German reading "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, wasn't the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a matter of disturbing the conference.
The action of the journalist had a strong restlessness, which was unacceptable.
He had caused the personnel to bring out the man.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate request or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is making the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15. July 2016 responsible.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not sure of the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was only arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of the detained journalists Mesale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good relaxing: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for conversations cheerfully at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller encounters many beer, some wine or higher-proof drinks with her guests to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing performances.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from movies like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "The horniest day".
However, the Munich citizen did not get the excursion to the far north well.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely emitter Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: never drinks the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leave out.
The alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others were simply enjoying the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the night saufgel age is not yet known.
However, since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and debris
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and litter.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette buttocks, rubbish and debris, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the bike path on the Hate hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike path in the Rotkäppchenland a more than odd sight.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also others have been concerned for some time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem was already raised in the cycling advisory board.
There has been no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter is the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the issue has also been submitted to the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives around cyclists and residents - the seating area is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only frequently suitable loud, they also destroy the foundations: pulled out of the earth, trash cans demolished, signs bent, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
You are angry that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for baptispense houses.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the hate hill," confirms the cycling representative, who is now also concerned with the new wheel site in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If it suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly the threshold is setting significantly higher to attack its own goods.
However, this would assume that a police patrol will come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of hate hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The marketing of tourism is still expandable.
Compared to others, our bike path is very high in Germany," say the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no turning track on the hate hill.
In case of lively traffic, cyclists may have to wait between the road on the road," she explains.
This is no problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest in the cultural station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family-friendly cooperation with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations were held, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a new night who lives long in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarn.
This contest, explained District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters look connected with?
The Hiltruper Lake and Marktallee were particularly often mentioned in the towns.
Rolf Ihmig named the Allee "Kö von Hiltrup" in his successful song.
The cultural station was also honoured.
Again and again it was about the experience of cooperation in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or clues to her work.
So one learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all kinds on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favourites of the jury, there were something special - so that others can also listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup shot, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children once again competed in the final - and even sounded "right well" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchment of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälischer Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the business association, and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She considered the event to be a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a visual screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red slide - when you have put it in it.
This ensures that the opposing side cannot accidentally read anything.
The cards are then, for example, to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4. Firm".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from then on.
For not the terms, but codes are to be guessed here.
Alternating one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption keys are to be guessed.
His task in this case: In this order and in this example - he should describe the terms "cube", "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, because if this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encrypter notes and reads loudly: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to the festival; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has looked attention at school and knows the window lintel there.
This is how it goes round by round, team for team continues.
One does not know the concepts of the opposite side - but this can better shape itself with any indication that the encrypter gives there.
The transfers should be as mysterious as possible, but not too wacky, otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule booklet.
The players probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video on decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you have started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre prime "codenames", which also puts an agent's topic for a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's all about rates and not about victory points, you can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harassing guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler's greeting in the upper town of a passing police patrol, then he also fell into a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he did not respond significantly alcoholic to the police secretion by the police, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspectorate.
In a sober state, he then also has to take criminal responsibility for using the number of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig was home to the push locomotives
For decades, the depot in Pressig was the turntable in the Franconian Forest.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers were banging buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
This did not stimulate anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and the wagons were clumping.
That was pure railway.
Statements that symbolise Dinkel's home town of Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest was a town thus characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain line to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after a climb of about 220 metres in altitude.
To cope with this, train and push locomotives were formerly needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway depot with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice stations, overhead line and railway master office.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway for 47 years.
The Railworks (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On the 15th On July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighings had been ranked every month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were terminated, and the rest were canceled in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that there has not been a better use of the location, including freight transport," but also in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg railway division celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 Years of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On the 1st In June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the shunting yard Pressig was history.
"The shunting riders and inhibition layers did the most difficult work in rail transport," recalls Dinkel.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two towns and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the in Franconia Plus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as before, Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putintzeva from Kazakhsten or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory tilled 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian gave up at number 13.
The Schwäbin is now faced with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors saw the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the Dahlmann Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourist association "Around the Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened in the 15th century. Year their gates.
A great visitor response showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the very first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, a few days ago, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and helped shape flyers.
On the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will again be a 70-cent special stamp, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betznausieren", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won for the musical accompaniment.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately ultimately expresses it.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often provided with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the "Glücksbaum" awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colour-lightened, playfully provided with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object seems fairytale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to devote herself to the event of 15 years of K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
Halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Windspiel performance" to stroll through the multifaceted art exhibition.
Until 31. The special exhibition can be visited in December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 lingooms: singers celebrate 50. Birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the nightlets also aired their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sanges life in the district.
It has become a legend: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, they were promoting 68 lingooms to the MGV.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated greatly in the "House of Encounter".
"It is fully done today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was to be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albendian singers.
They had rekindled the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the festival of tradition was back.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seating as usual in the "House of Encounters", but at tables.
In between, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It's a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten had the voice ring out.
Happy songs were announced on suit.
Almost already set: "Such a day, as beautiful as it is today".
In suit the exquisite vine juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" were heard, which is the Latin name for "hops".
Again was the choir director of Richard Homann, who is one of the fives who were in Tinnenbusch at that time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "It has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he performs." By the way, this time not only men were singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create her own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodious poetry.
There was also a large bonbola.
The proceeds will be used to finance the children of the Albatros youth centre a visit to the Allwetterzoo.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high class Derby against BW Aasee
The risingman marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring finds itself really right in League three.
No trace of shy or frecks, the independents make their thing.
And at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." Quite the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game was checked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a sentence ball.
"If they bring it to the finish, such a game can tip," knows Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"All of us are aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break the neck.
I saw really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not know 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem to be foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3. League has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball." In the fourth league, they no longer want to look down.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will first reach Emlichheim.
Aasee steps on 14. October in Essen.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of head hosts Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she walked aboard forever.
The series that made her a star may be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues perceived me on an equal footing," says Keller in a conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know whether he liked it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her man at that time may have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans also said about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right thing and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have obscured," as she explains further.
She always felt "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes once more, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding wedding, I sat in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love too naively."
The moth, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured into the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the bright gloss in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds it overduty.
But it's just film festival, more or less want to sunk in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he moves over the square to make himself easier for himself in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The center of need in the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a great effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
On this evening, however, stink to heaven in the oasis of masters for some reason.
So out here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests who have entered the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown were shown by the whole globe.
What do you not have to come up with anything about an article about this festival in order not to fall into refuge for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a volume around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two beemeared bouncers actually wave him in.
Inside, they crowd, dance to live music far after midnight, or let DJs yield rhythms to which they yell at each other, and washed down exquisite appetizers with cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for sappy mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the shelving of fully exclusive products have not been cleared up for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Carry a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If there are two separate instructions, he has queized in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged table dumps a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that evening.
But there is a face that seems familiar to the observer, the director of the opening film, between local celebrities, cash table and kitchen items, draws a face that is known to the observer.
His leading actor should not be far there.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks, with almost sixty looking almost like a choral boy, through the crowd.
He is not being looked at, not shaped, one looks at at most stealthily.
International stars love this film festival, especially for this reluctance, like to be misunderstood as blindfold.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is happy to win his team.
Argentine's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have come to terms with his new homeland Mexico.
After a 2-0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the stairs to cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow-coloured jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second division strip had defeated the Leones Negros 2–0 on Saturday.
After the game Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to last-minute bankruptcy "damaged"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association club ASV Send, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat". His protégés were "dreamt on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankrupt - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally sleeped" was annoyed by the ASV coach.
The hosts quickly led with 8:1, even the early break, which Bieletzki had taken, did not fruit at first.
"But suddenly a jerk went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
The gap was only two goals for the break.
Especially sending best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase one time and again.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst spent the 15:15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three goals (29:26).
And then?
Take the impartial ones into the events.
Bieletzki usually beware of seeking the debt to others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff received, "was a joke."
LIT had laughed well and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, even stood well at the back against seven men and repeatedly thrown on the empty goal.
Only they can buy very little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to be taken," says Bieletzki, who served completely.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police digs for body parts

On Saturday, emergency personnel dug up a road near Marxgrün.

The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are looking for on the net.
However, users can also provide additional security themselves.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it hurt to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the multi-billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange supervisory authority enclosed out of court a dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to hold listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk also gives the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain head of the board.
In the comparison, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager of Manhattan for fraud before the U.S. federal court.
Musk, who is also heading the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk had said that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On the 7th August, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters, perhaps he would take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, the financing was secured.
This would have evaluated Tesla at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock market.
Following the agreement, Tesla now has to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee that oversees Musk's communications.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of recent weeks, GroKo has collected several survey lows.
The SPD falls back in a question behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD supplements by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD makes a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU are also losing a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest figure for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday the federal elections were elections, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the grand coalition has currently lost the majority in the Sunday issue at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties continue to reach 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they were still awarded 53.4 percent.

The Greens reached the shares of the vote of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.

Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person to the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the poll, only one second (50 percent) wishes the grand coalition in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, 41 percent are a new election.

The Germans also assess split whether Merkel should run for the CDU chairman again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent.
Accordingly, 64 percent do not want a candidacy for the Union supporters, 35 percent.
Notice at Aldi: Price-reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Those who say that in the age of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintances stories - she should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost exudes an anachronistic romanticism as a place for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer bargain on the root or the favourite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere scam to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We dared to test: How do women react, you don't spend long talk around the hot mother in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Hollywood Lovestory potential has it when the love happiness precedes an eye-lost-and-again-found-plot.
If the type also reports to its beloved, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Konsorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertiser in an Aldi branch unknown to us to find that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has talked briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic put meat".
For believing in the magic of the analogue getting to know each other, she definitely deserves her happy ending a la Hollywood.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher's appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went hard into the court with his own.
He gave himself, the coach of the football district club VfL Wolbeck, retired (inwardly) to ponder the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile it runs again around the Brandhoveweg.
Dew-freshback evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only snapped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
"We have made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be shown," praised Fetsch's boys and went to each individual after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it went almost seamlessly from the 4-4-2 to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting in the front lines for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs missed the lead before his end (17th), the substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th).
This almost avenged it would have come to light when the SCA hit up twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Kasten in minute 41 - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 metres failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes in the command of Thewes.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch gave the left side another fresh cell cure.
As Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer in the 70th anniversary of the old Rhine. Minute Robin Westhues fell, there was an indirect free kick for the lords 18 meters before the guest housing.
The Gefoulte stepped on itself and demonstrated its dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slippers hit the lower left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes still that should become damn long.
And then: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in 80. Minute the leather in the penalty area unhappy to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the present (79.).
Anxious minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th. Minute from twelve meters had the hit on the Puschen.
Had perhaps too much of the good things be.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes
"Research performance of the VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine is encouraging"

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
When landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m., there was a drama on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
During the landing of a helicopter, there were turbulences, as the police confirmed against oe24.
The helicopter was gripped by a wind gust, crashed onto the ground and came to a standstill sideways.
The police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately informed.
The forces reached the accident site with a large contingent.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called to be careful.
Inmates only slightly hurt
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage to property.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain uncommon in company directors
This means that only 8 percent of the boards as of the reporting date 1 were September female, as can be seen from the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said Stiftungs Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The late backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also attributable solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
The proportion of women has stagnated among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interests," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have indicated that they would not continue to make a commitment to increase the share of "zero percent".
Another picture emerges with the supervisory boards: The proportion of women there was 30.5 percent there - 45 women more and 68 men less than they did a year ago.
"If they recruited as many women for the boards every year, a share of 40 percent would be achieved in 2023," the report says.
Some even make Miese: Luxury cards: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
The best earned Ferrari.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operations.
Large cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Anyone who makes the most profit per car among the classy providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers per car they sell?
This question has dealt with "autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operations with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, and Tesla and Bentley even put every car on a strong margin.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and taxes.

"It's nice that so many have found the way to us to Abtswind again." Later, "The Troglauer" caused a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the drink prices in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary.
A festive evening to the 60th anniversary Wine festival will take place on Friday, 5. October, in the guest's house before taking place in the party tent one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency doctor car crashed into taxi
An emergency vehicle is severely damaged next to a street.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue service ended a fatal year for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police told.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency doctor's car had crossed a red traffic light with a blue light on Saturday afternoon and Martinshorn.
He then came together at a crossroads with the taxi, which was riding at green.
The doctor's car hurled against a traffic light mast and a tree after the collision.
He recorded the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency prisoner, also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police in close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor's office investigated who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we uncomfortable
After the disgrigic end in the League Cup, Manchester United is now losing in 7. Round of the Premier League.
One is 1:3 against West Ham United. The way of defeat should give you more to talk.
The scene in the 74 was symbolic. Minute, in which the reinese Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all the defenders of Manchester stopped, and allowed Arnautovic all times in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a long-incant performance.
The mood of Uniteds city rival Manchester City is currently quite different.
The Citizens coached by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came to Brighton & Hove Albion for an approximate 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the frontguard's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer tableleader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 draw against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-Aus, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th Minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who was in the 66th. Minute for Mohamed Salah came onto the pitch, after 70 minutes missed the balance.
It was better to Daniel Sturridge in the 89th. Minute with his Schlenzer.
So after the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was unbeatable for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and the blues Liverpool crashed from the top of the table by the draw in the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 wins.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to compete against the surprise team from Hertfordshire until 81. minute to a success message.
Nine minutes to go, Watford defender Craig Cathcart, unhappily gave Alex Iwobi his goal, and only two minutes later, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil provided the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to the fifth victory in a row and is now in 5th place behind the big rival Tottenham. Wolverhampton, promoted by his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo, continues to leave a strong impression.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and occupy the 8th time. Place.
VW core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go out at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Show, they will be showing their new products together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital from the coming week.
The diesel does not really play a major role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the brilliant backdrops of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models with them: the e-tron of the Ingolstadt-based company is to be launched on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
But both have been officially presented.
The iNext of BMW will not be scheduled to start in 2021.
The new 3 Series is the focus in Paris.
This year, a total of 4 to 14. October more than 250 exhibitors represented.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which is celebrating its 120th anniversary of this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
The severe earthquakes and the following tsunami have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake was the magnitude of 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, and there were enormous damage to property.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still going up.
The figures have so far only been from Palu.
But numerous other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the pastoral interests of the strong two-wheeler riders in the horse riding industry.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at the North House of the North Helle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, around 150 bikers had come together to commit one anything but ordinary worship.
The cars were already lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church from 10 a.m.
At first, the biker breakfast was on the agenda and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was preached during the Bikers' Duty Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical background was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill beats rather poetic-calmous tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big celebration: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the process of ripe apple to apple juice for his astonished viewers.
At times, Hartmann-Niemerg gave the children the field and let them fill the apples into the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink would become one day.
But they were also able to look at this important work step this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and covered with nets, Georg Hartmann stacked-nin the piece of apple layer by layer, which looks a little like choppy good.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the fruiting farmer had already finished specialties with it.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the older visitors to the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtreprf" was correspondingly high.
The parents talked in a cosy atmosphere, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple presses, but also discovered the bouncy castle that was built for themselves.
Active from the fellow fathers also became involved in the celebration and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The home association will once again offer a day of action in the coming year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the scene.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, it will be round about milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season-purt sign: "Shissene situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter assembled his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 to him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive thing before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out as a team," said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed for: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the Anschluss, are at the bottom with two points and are a candidate for relegation in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th. Minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, which after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa-League game against Lazio Rome, advanced with seven points in the midfield of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive campaign of Hesse during his starting debut and never got a grip on Hanover's defense.
The foreign striker, which has long been pushed after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable to the harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was on loan from Liverpool, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurt residents, which began to sweep.
A header by Lucas TorrÃ3 (17th, faltered on the goal net) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense for the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the hosts fell almost inevitably and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic took the ball after a repelled corner into the penalty area, Haller extended with his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender who had come from the French second division club AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt subsided before the break.
This time, Haller fitted his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refuelled and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the half-time Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played forward a little more courageously, but igniting ideas were left until shortly before the end, when the connection hit was still successful.
The Hessen was much more efficient.
After about an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laying across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show runs for the Frankfurt-based guests against the winners, and Jovic also hit one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Worms Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the opening of the 185 audience.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Catholics of Geisringians celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on the 14th September or Sunday after.
The festive divine service takes place in the town church, after which there is a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the closing blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shoten Christ, who dates back to the 30-year war and to which, according to legend, a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.
Blood flowed out of the shot wound.
This developed into a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is not finished to date, only the chancel stands, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the Cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite the importance for the parish of Geising, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross-Church took place and the church part of the Cross ended with the closing coff.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting to a secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, and Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will last until next year.
After the scaffolding has already been said for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation comes more expensive than planned, because the damage already present a few years ago has increased, but more have been determined, which was only made possible by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering has been completed, before winter, the natural stone work is to be started and they hope to be able to complete well half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New residence in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its purpose in Münsterblickstraße - all the present attendees agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Dormitory of Living Support Danube-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept, architecture Rudolf Bader takes a wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer's building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house had gone old and no longer had a timely equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and brightly as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Life assistance invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State paid 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned frame - in terms of time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move even without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, expressed a similar view: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents who need aids to be mobile."
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residential area in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, spread over three residential groups on almost 1500 square metres.
Life Aid Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariffs.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the deputy SPD chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all fellow countrymen not to resign themselves to the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern at the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean pungsan dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their recipient on Thursday.
They were therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to "envy".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the power of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and apply together to host the Olympic Games in 2032.
As part of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this memorial year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect back to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, is very different in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which was founded on 1. October will appear.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Grand Coalition, which is beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly any speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU have not conjured up the "return to work in practice".
This may have led many craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise working citizens in this country to ask the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but it's because of it.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself back to its mandate - to governing - they should not be stopped by debates about it.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of recent weeks may already be able to achieve something together, will possibly show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet to form the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to draw up this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the dispute.
At first, however, the diesel retrofits and the immigration law on skilled labour are again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, and the manufacturers see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofitting older diesels.
While the diesel crisis has become apparent over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned immigration law on skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD demands a prospect of rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strictly opposed to the 'spur change' from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be disputes among the coalition partners again - and how could it be otherwise?
It was not equal and equal that has joined the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Quarrel is good.
Without a dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not make progress.
However, in order to be constructive, dispute must not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It is still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD are to dispute - but always have the reality of people in view.
What is feasible and benefiting many?
With this key question, both the diesel and lane change questions can be clarified pragmatically - and thus gained trust.
This is what the People's Partys must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in their sights
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night," her legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste pilgrimage data controller Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprised - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via a question.
She assumes that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the commitment of her team and did not want to announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "copish from any suspicion".
Police tear down a street in search of female corpse
Marxgrün - The police did not want to express themselves in a long position on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, there has been a dug on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
Together with its leader, the dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bone, was finally able to limit the relevant location to a few metres in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said street area.
For more than a year, the public prosecutor and criminal police have been processing Hof's missing case.
Again and again, a cycle path was closed in Marxgrün and examined with sonar equipment because the investigators assume that Heike's bodies may have been buried here in the course of the new state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But riots occur before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum from 1. Clashes between separatists and the police occurred in the centre of Barcelona on October 1st, 2017.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with pain powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Around 3,000 officials from the police units of the National and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honour their colleagues with a rally last year, who were deployed in the referendum classified as illegally classified in the polling stations.
Violence had occurred at the time when it tried to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break through the police chain by force, and the officers were thrown at the offenders with paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested, 24 others had been slightly injured, it was said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also switched abroad.
Several ministers from the then regional government and other activists from the separatist movement, on the other hand, are still sitting in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathering perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen part to endless
Red and White Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Only a 0-0 draw was enough for FC Gütersloh.
They turned out to be done in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion as gathered hope.
The first half was severely covered by the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do it without worrying.
There was no risk of missing a chance, because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal of the entire game, Gütersloh drew Nick Flock in the 28th. Minute responsible.
The best - and in principle also real - had the best - possibility, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerdler with a shot from the penalty area border forced to a parade after 32 minutes.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th. Sebastian Mützel from 18 metres aimed minute just over the housing, and after one hour, the Gütersloh residents also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a reconnaissance of shooting by Matthäus Wieckowicz it went on.
The quickly performed counter about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a sweet shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also pursued a header by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interlaboratory coach Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahleners did not manage more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st. Minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance, but she didn't earn anything either.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like it that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as against wood windings, and even though our opponent didn't want to play along here," RW said Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensive "all things were ploughing a little" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't have the feeling that we could get a goal," says Daut.
To his regret, however, as a spectator, they didn't have the feeling that their team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Fortunately, there is enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased with the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was brightly blue, the square, on the other hand, still somewhat empty, but that should change during the day.
Because: "Here it is so nicely sociable, that's why we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a neat pinch of humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in for the Brockmann couple, which was supposed to be weighed against food.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to be able to entertain the more and more visitors musically.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung along lately.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in its schedule.
He is happy about the many active members with their estates, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be anything like a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's chorus.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean up" action that took place in September.
Our garden city is a colourful painting - what works here.
Then the May wreath was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to winter quarters.
Many stalls have been worked on for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heartstick, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his scroll saw.
Veneer, beer mats with trekking motifs and a few more he had on offer.
Three barking fields belongings were offered a specialist: "Rgelfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter still has a specialty with him.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is sociable that the visitors allowed to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Fraudini with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown persons have argued in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skate system.
There are corresponding smears in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal complaints have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the career choice fair on 19. September a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro was discovered.
Since the short message at the time had obviously been "only" left with an edding, it could be removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was shot again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case gets a special note right from the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realisation should also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, says there are already promises, without saying any name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the smeared table.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate plant.
After the old one at the LWL clinic was dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally spoke out most of the fire station for fire parking.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The city council then had the last word.
He starts with a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Bottleneck in air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said Matthias Maas, the German press agency, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5. October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight defaults is the long-known staff stamp in European air traffic control offices, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for ready-to-trained pilots across Europe has been empty.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal state government, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city to tackle the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, who has many members of the state-owned German air traffic control.
Maas once again held the EU Commission's guidelines for the pilot board.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period current until 2019 were far too low.
The cost specifications and personnel savings in the case of national air traffic control providers are now fully involved in the operations.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to advocate in Brussels for regulations that "do not further reduce the air traffic control."
Currently, the EU requirements are being voted on by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is exposed to constant lobbying printing by the airlines.
"Ryanair leader Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high costs of delay with the airlines initiated a rethink.
The GdF will only participate in improving the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
The previously announced recording of 120 pilot students each year over the next five years is enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staff increase is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group Reconstruction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden company is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to have their headquarters in Essen and are listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reductions beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two retirements, the supervisory board on the capital side has only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are faced with this.
However, a general meeting is expected to take the final decision in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the combined steel business with its Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest traits away from each other with a large contingent.
According to the emergency services, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
According to the information, there were also between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had been taking action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government almost exactly one year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil find it unjust that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was provoked that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they got annoyed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a big European city and there is more echoing here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security vulnerability in a cell phone app has meant that the personal data of ministers and deputies from the British Conservative Tory Party on Saturday was temporarily accessible to everyone.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown persons after the breakdown became known one day before the Tory Party conference in Birmingham.

Soccer: Juve-Coaunts Prayer for Top Game: Ronaldo's Best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after 3:1 (1:1) - victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo was a lot of fun and does it good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three assists, Juve shot the game after the early backlog by Dries Merten's hit (10. Minute) and hanged the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goal scorer brought by Real Madrid initially took up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work to the hit of head of defense boss Leonardo Bonucci (76) after a corner, who only had to insert just before the goal line.
"He's giving many templates," praised the trainer.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record gatekeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to become even better at serving it," demanded the coach.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With Ronaldo's purchasing for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. In 21 points, the champion of the seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The second to the standing trained by the former Bavarian coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the reference to the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to step into after getting too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel attention.
The German international has prevailed at Juve.
The professional from Liverpool FC was in action at all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off court in the 2-0 win of the Turin team and suspended for the home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the weekend at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused the forehead and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he may only be called "Ye", says the musician.
"The nature that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he gave his stage name.
The pseudonym is no news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", the rapper says.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
This was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more gripped, we have done him hardly ever with problems." The list of Hoetmar phrase options reads correspondingly thin.
Grade times two goal odds in 90 minutes, so rarely games can be shaped positively.
Football Circles A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Even the SG had only two options in the first round, but the first used Maik Krause from an acute angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd Minute could have raised Steffen Uphus, but after Krause's preliminary work, he had been standing freely.
The hosts had only a double option when Moritz Höne to goal sire Jos Schuhmacher failed and in the aftermath of Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A trade fmeter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the goal line and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide pierced the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticised ourselves hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was Florian Kraus' conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Both-permanent), Turl.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectakball football in Albenden: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he wrestled in words.
"We have no access to them." With them he presumably meant the wings tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites, who noticed with a collective offensive urge.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, winched cheekily, but then drew his players from the relief that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely newsletters, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class maintenance.
GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him with understandably mixed feelings.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2 against it, how we hold over the entire season against one of the top teams of the league, that was really phenomenal."
It therefore proves to be that one now has to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner brought the hosts with his 12. Season goal in the lead (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put 2:0 over the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take it out completely like this.
"That was already madness, what it did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent envy.
Shortly before the change of side, his own elf achieved the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia gatekeeper Hinkerohe into the long trek (45th).
After the change of side, it was McGill again who scored the equalis (59th).
After that it went back and forth.
It was a crunchy, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albendages again (64th), just five minutes later, Patrick Horstmann resembled (69.).
Despite the majority, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We must now focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against the squadts, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Anger (64th), 3:3 p.m. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th/Albands).
Soccer: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus

Media: Total Executive Board of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire executive committee of football division Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.

Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of Pomp
It's good that he's gone.
There are only a few state guests who ask Germany to leave as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Protestant Academy Tutzing: Celebrities guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wanted to pick up the tolerance price in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
This is what academy director Udo Hahn reckoned him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us." The fact that celebrities repeatedly appear at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on the 29th The writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also confirmed: he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also awarded in another category by television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is not safe!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a conference on the 200th anniversary of the 200th an
The birthday of Karl Marx soon awaits one more visitors of the direction of criticism of capitalism, the others rather a tendency "from left-side outside to the middle".
What does it look like with neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musical cadet: Gender expert with heart - Wolbeck - Western Balkans
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret chestnut, Teubner anticipated the gender communication, not only with humor and warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, this is the male sparring partners, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congeniously harmoniously accompanies Süverkrükpp, Teubner, that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely as it fitted with the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but he did not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, brings no benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp slides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart in a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not miss an additional thanks.
She had the idea of treating the duo to one in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's Regional League: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with the third liga player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten goals.
"Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has scored too many goals.
We didn't get the grip on them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many exuberant opportunities.
This time his team lacked the concentration in the conclusion.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end of a residue, was in the back for a break with 11:12 and later 15:18 (45.) in the back.
Only towards the end was the wider bank of the hosts making itself crucial.
In addition, Aydogdu put rear space Merle Klement on the left outside, which then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Suspended (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), pp. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again been in the leading group of the 3. Liga West established.
At the second tier relegated VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked that now," said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the overthrown standing leader.
The guests dominated the first round almost as you wish.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went to the runner-up of the previous year at 25:15.
Essen has accepted in a two-bar, but did not come into play.
We have kept them busy.
Our opponent has opened high-risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second movement, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Food has changed the adoption to triple.
We could not hold the impact print.
Food strucked, and we let ourselves lull a bit," Münch continues.
At 18:17, the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose for the first time.
Although Ostbevern still refused four set balls at the 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the instructor at the rise.
Maike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silge, and their serves essentially contributed to the fact that the BSV shifted the tray in the third section of 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played there consistently and calmly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue-white passage four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Municipality: Opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne was initiated by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be laboriously climbed together," said the chairman of TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the membership of Muslims with Germany with German leaders side by side with German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public opinion has "encouraged many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, there is finally Folktreff time again.
On the 18th The Nottuln home club already organizes his fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alten Amtmannei at 19:30.
Almost exactly for the day it is a year since we had done a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting settles so quickly in Nottuln etaÃ3.
Whether Storm Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the Amtmannei fireplace room was always fully occupied.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites musicians friends to not ulneration.
Klaus Spellmeyer agreed with his accordion for the first folk meeting "birthday".
He was a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with shallow German lyrics.
Now he is on the road with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreffs are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten inspired the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent home with a catchy tune.
"We count on many cheerful guests to spend a convivial and humorous evening once again," says the home association's invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to join in.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be held until 24. October it is clarified.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger still includes approvals in South Korea and - as the largest hurdle - in the USA.
Most recently, the chances of being approved by an insider had improved there because Linde promised the sale of additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be held until 24. October to be clarified so that the merger succeeds.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On the 29th In September 1893, the last founding impulses for the district association for horticulture and state care were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbach club house, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbach town hall.
Of course, it was called otherwise at the time: As the "Bezirksobbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit farming association also differed from today's work - it was actually about fruit growing, about flowers and gardening at that time nobody thought.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," explained district home curator Günter Dippold in his presentation.
Fruit trees were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which include almost 7,000 members.
But that is far from exhausted the spectrum.
Near-natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as the teaching of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwerfen" showed entertaining on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, district chairman, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can be done with smartphone & Co. can gather similar much joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, emphasising the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district was also left with no doubt about this, district managing director and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a lecture and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came from the garden, for the winter it became impossible.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen garden had turned into an ornamental and living garden.
"Nature endures, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves towards it," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, complemented the president of the Bavarian regional association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the glaring decline in insects, we owe this to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif. Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower brass of the Thurnau music club.

Priority to Nafta Talks: Canada's Foreign Minister publishes UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: you provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York because of the time pressure to write a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, it announced its spokesman Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement that it has already entered between its country and the US.
The USA and Mexico agreed on a new version of the regional free trade agreement Nafta in August.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for more than a year.
They are now to be concluded until Sunday evening (local time), Trump's administration wants the agreement before the 1. October to the U.S. Senate.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-designate, Andres Manuel LÃ3pez Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a stabbing attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the right-wing extremist ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked in the streets during an election campaign in southern Brazil at the beginning of September.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Below the title "Ele nÃo" (in English: "Der nicht") especially women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and women-fading statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected to attend the economic metropolis of Sao Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand for a standstill.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7th September October.
As a former mayor of the megacity of Sao Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in the political company for a long time, it is now an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reach an absolute majority, there will be an absolute majority on 28. October a runoff.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from him - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He repeatedly shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said the supporters of Lula's left Workers Party were to be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children on their deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin, which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's breakup in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Lars Lökke Rasmussen in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the opponent of the monarchy Larsen in 2010 at the 70th anniversary of the monarchy. The birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: Volume at jackhammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a rewritten translation of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure from three bands friends with others.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even take their time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands visibly the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night are visibly.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD at the start of the concert evening.
In front of the stage, the band's coherent and punchy interplay is danced at the performance.
Although "Encore" calls are not to be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds reminiscent of classic 1970s rock, sometimes reminiscent of classic 1970s, demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is also used for "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost balamic "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnish house has earned a special degree of recognition since its founding in 2005.
The band presents their hard rock on Saturday with full agility.
It is obvious and unmistakable that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets their own accents in collaboration with the band, even in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo at the felt even higher acting than before, whereby he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is of course included in the genre-related at such hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" Rocknacht, according to the team of mixing desk, the three-per team of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is roughly at hammer level, but is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", which "The Ignition" point to on its website.
But the Ahlen audience doesn't need amortal audience at this rock night at this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say in the end.
And enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A glider crashed on Sundays in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen a car park.
The pilot died in the accident.
There was a fatal accident near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider crashed at the airport on the trade fair parking lot.
The pilot lost their lives.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a single seater.
The aircraft was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just near a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr towns and directly at the ascent to motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Essen Trade Fair or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump rushes to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President North Korea’s leader Kim is quite sympathetic despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragic: It is a distance relationship.
In public, on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang in front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, although he proves to be a rather tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he too, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it was not only the conversations with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The fact that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be expensive to everyone seemed to be true to the US president.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of it at his performance in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How horrible, how horrible is that?
This is so predetermined.
But this cares very little, Trump declared, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there would not be 10,000 people outside pushing into this full-packed arena, but we would have only 200 people outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and on top of that, sumptuously spoiled by the sun: Baesweiler's city centre dressed up on Sunday with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair.

Refugees saved by video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have used a phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya and thus made their rescue possible.
The group had turned their inclusion in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July at the risk of his life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put his life in danger.
One of his colleagues was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year with the program, said the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

A 75-year-old has had to spend several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central Franconia after he had tied the car off all forest paths and blocked a tree's door.
Rescue workers discovered the car by chance on Saturday afternoon not far from a pasture and freed those who had been missing since Tuesday evening, the police told on Sunday.
According to the data, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without care.

Laschet warns the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This is mainly affected waves of arrests, the press and religious freedom.
He therefore had "clear at Erdogan that if relations are to be normalised in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
Laschet also spoke of the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
As a result, Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a line of flying readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport at the short term.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact persons - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea demands for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of emphasizing the successes in negotiating the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a courtesy of Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula in the UN debate in the UN debate.
"The recent standstill is that the US is building on coercive measures that are fatal for building confidence," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way to be the first to disarm ourselves," said North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that punitive measures could "force the knee" is "a pipe dream of people who do not know us."
However, in order to build trust, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasised.
However, there were no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had adopted three times sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone.
In recent days, US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have insisted on strict compliance with the punitive measures at the United Nations.
At the same time, the US government is working towards rapprochement.
In June, Trump first hit North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to travel to Pyongyang again for talks about ending the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting after the many visitors to the open door, the many visitors to the HoT open door were not along: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvesting service.
The young people of the HoT conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank me with food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the nause was the nasty surprise on the first day after the summer break: a power outage had decommissioned the huge, two-part refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we were supported by friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone tackled.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Cooks can't get better," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have created," said Father Frank Beckmann, while magician caused astonishment to card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW
The head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has handed over his post in the regional association from frustration with criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-heading of the NRW boards, said Sartor of the "Welt am Sonntag".
There have fallen too many in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed the understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor has taken the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - people spoke about who didn't even know exactly why the Essen table was doing that."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there is no change," says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticised the criticism of colleagues from other boards in the "Welt am Sonntag".
One must not take the approach, "without us starve the people of the city."
It is the state's task to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweeter," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis, who criticized me at that time.

Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation for 1:1 with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot from 20 metres of the Aargauer, as was powerless, as was the second counter-star after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies in Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.

In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are currently voting on whether the name of their country in northern Macedonia should be changed.
In a yes, the nearly three decades of smouldering could be resolved with neighbour Greece.
Because of its northern province of the same name, Athens had insisted on a name change and blocked any rapprochement with the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future West integration.
The US had announced that the country could become a NATO member quickly in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage comes into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two were yes to say yes in Hamburg on Saturday.
Kahrs had previously said the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right". He has been with his partner for 25 years.

Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was quite a lot of work before the members of the Civic Association for Children's Home and the Society of Leprosy.
This is because around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And a lot of things have accumulated.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge has already been shorn.
The breakfast, which is always following the work, has also been a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the canoe slalom world championship
Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old took a perfect run on the Olympic route on Sunday.

I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the facility and everything was going on today," said the Olympic third of London in 2012.

The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - what burglars want to take advantage of again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempt to break-in yesterday this autumn.
The fact that it remained on Königswieser Straße when trying to try the single-family home is due to the alarm system.
This started when the perpetrators were attached on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars sensed that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, obviously surprised them so much that they took flight without prey.

Pleazone at Hertha: Caught up by reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The title is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin does not want FC Bayern to put up with it."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance under the new coach Niko Kovac is not to increase for the Munich residents to the greater autumnal low.
"A week ago you had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we have some of the reality caught up with," Thomas Müller said after the earninged 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoyed to us and that we therefore step on the gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year, no goal of its own, as at the same time of the preseason two competitive matches in a fulbyte without a victory, the lead in the football Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as it was the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record master must be warned.
FC Augsburg on a view of 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the recently overpowering Bavaria, which seems too mighty, are to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we do not put up with that and that we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he avoided surprisingly gently with his losers in his native city and merely shifted his first defeat as a Munich coach for the renewedly incapable dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless like the first interim conclusion of his term of office before the international break - otherwise the tone will probably be worse.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which also had conquered AEK Athens with 3:0 at the start.
"Now we've gotten in two games, but we will also make our goals again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke in plain lyrics.
The right-back appeared in the role of admonisher.
"I don't think that this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the large number of opportunities and make the mistakes at the bottom," stressed the 23-year-old just before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of last playing time, the Bayern were even already with five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over the top again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich at least assessed positively with a wink that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international player.
It is good for the league.
DFB-Boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB leader defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, the sharply attacked by Özil Grindel in the Mainz ZDF "Sports studio" announced the consequences of the cause.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this is not happening again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again declared that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with sharp words.
Our German-born Mesut Özil and our Ilkay, born and raised in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they had themselves photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, I could not digest it as their president that our two young men who have promoted the German national team were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, after the World Championship affair, which had begun with the two of the two, had "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Championship affair, which had begun with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to come together in front of players in the future.
That someone says: When I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is to be appointed as a conclusion.
"If one without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says: "The topic is important, we have to take care of ourselves," would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for position as DFB president again next year.
"I do my work and make an effort to do it as well as it is," said Grindel.
Yearlings builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old rider was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against their car.
However, there was no turnout to become a replacement, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone notification about a car driver who would have gone off the road and driven against a leading post.

Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember many things.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Still almost 1000 volunteers in action.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr grounds in Emsland, 980 volunteers are still employed in the firefighting work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.

The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday homeowners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hamburg.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage comes into force for all, the politician has married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage comes into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two were yes to say yes in Hamburg on Saturday.
Kahrs had previously said the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had held on 30. June 2017 attracted attention with a rage speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "pride stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since the 1. October 2017 can marry same-sex couples just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had registered their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right to adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state will be called northern Macedonia in the future.
It consists of its northern province of the same name, the neighbouring Greece.

If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the starting signal for their country's western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be harvested with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, the relatives do not know the deceased's wish.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system is already in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can earn their wishes - per or counter organ donation -", she says.
Federal health minister Jens Spahn has come out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or their relatives contradict.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head calculations
The 14-year-old pupil Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in calculations.
He prevailed over the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 comrades-in-arms.
Martina Flamme-Jasper announced this from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,122 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with a calculator.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already there two years ago when the then 14-year-old was present in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Head-raising can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even calculating competitions in stadiums.
Disciplines include, for example, squareroot drawing from six-digit numbers.
When it comes to showing versatility, the candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they need to find a solution quickly.
The Germans also have a good chance here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because head-calcasing is learned more intensively and with other effective methods there in early childhood.
Insurgent Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's about Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows her soulful and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and advocate for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.

The singer Chrissy Amphlett died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams himself had died almost a year ago.
There were complications when her daughter Alexis Olympia was born.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lung.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a draft law to the so-called "symbolic law" in view.
This is intended to significantly extend the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar Cold Air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the start of the week - it could snow in narrow valleys with a heavy intensity of about 1,000 metres, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow above 2,000 metres are to be expected.
On higher-lying passport roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner High Alpine Road), the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start with the annual bend maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start with the annual crease care on Monday.
The "green ramparts", which is unique in Germany, have been shaping the landscape of the low-forest state for about 200 years.
The up to five metre wide tree and whitewash are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreat spaces.
Knicks combine scattered habitats as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were laid down on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: By "turning around" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges extend between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a woody, multi-shaped landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 animal species as a replacement habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre and kill up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he will atrophied to a bright row of trees, which loses the wind protection effect in addition to biodiversity, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the crease care may only be carried outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia, talks about local SItuation
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the local local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which are completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where do people living on Sulawesi now hold on?
Many have run on the surrounding hills, where they still persevere for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are partly free to run around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many corpses around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that did not work and we only received information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who they do not know whether they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.
Muscular injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo suffered a muscle fibre rising in the back left thigh at the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga football team said on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle blazing in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not submit a forecast for downtime.
A muscle bundle pan usually cures within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre bruise usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The film festival of San Sebastián closes annually the round of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the other things to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers at Lake Olching saw a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the water guard station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency services again and again.
At the end she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to include the zemen and push back to the land, where it was then put in a transport box with a brave grip after almost an hour by a firefighter.
The duck injured by the chest was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Upper Abuse.
But according to the initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is targeting World Championship Medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was biathlete Julian Eberhard in the stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfelden wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang, which is within reach.
In the end, seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze.
"I deliberately left my time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
One medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is therefore more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the Constitution to a major event to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Championship trail in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the course in its heart," he remembers his fourth World Cup position in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the relay he was ranked second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo speed, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for the judge's current candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial for allegations of allegations.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline by Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that have been more than 30 years ago.
The recent turning point in the drama about the conquest of Kavanaugh, accompanied by a culture war, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer shouted angry Tiraden against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly, contrary to his original announcement, Senator Jeff Flake declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultocular scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the severe reprimands on Thursday as "Beschiss", initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "luck in the accident".
In this way, final doubts could be removed, he said.
Later, Trump strongly attacked the Democrats at an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
Also, the White House has narrowed the powers of investigators extremely.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, nothing more, a government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on an fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar unit installed in a "civil vehicle" by the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit will be from Monday, 1. October, stationed at Gartenstraße.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: The fear has been felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blues had succeeded in finalising the short term 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
It could have actually been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco to safety: "Overall, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing".
Schin actually no header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continued to retreat.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone of the heart," said Schöpf, who had no slightly part of it with his head ball hit: "I am actually the worst header player in the man's chase."
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start powerfully in the initial phase and turn it into fireworks," said Schalke's boss coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, calm and brave, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the greatest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal blue failed to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example due to the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a trembling victory," said Tedesco: "You have felt the fear a little."
Therefore, I am glad that we have won.
He was not the only shell.
Fischbachau: Smoking column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday around 1.30 p.m. observed a fire.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found the cause: An unknown person had lit garbage on a two-square-metre area on the two-metre area of the Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau fire brigades were busy with moving apart and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
They are faced with the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance when the evening is hosting the evening.
El-Mafaalani relaxes reading, describing the book's writing process, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting issues: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts increasingly arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society is sitting at a table, at the cat table the first generation migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the large table and now want to have a say in this area.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not decisive whether one classifies one politically to the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he stresses.
Initially, rather restrained, the discussion is always active.
And there is a need for speech.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee reports that two teachers tell us how they see successful or undone integration in students.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, continued to discuss intensively.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen prevailed against Central German BC in a hard-fought game in its own hall with 91:84 (43:46).
The ambitious Bonners won the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champion Bayern Munich and the former series master Brose Bamberg had significantly more effort at the beginning of the new season.
Munich already struggled to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the development area Landsham-Süd on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick said this.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 properties are completed, which the municipality under more favourable conditions or. Offers prices - similar to the former local model.
A good 100 applications had been received, said Frick.
"The documents are currently being checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim is to have drawn up the applicant ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
The award could then be awarded.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses, each with eight residential units each.
The development is now virtually completed, and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 properties in the socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, the area of the development area Landsham-Süd is created for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start of the new daycare center.
Three kindergarten groups and three groups of nurseries as well as a multi-purpose room are to be accommodated.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Thus Schalke's Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting eleve for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo would like to thank Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been sitting in the Schalker start elevator for the third time in a row, but on the substitution bench, the understanding would have been great with many people if the almost two-meter Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalke players gathered as usual in the middle circle after the 1:0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his pros, the 36-year-old, who everyone calls Naldo, said; "We have to thank coach, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, had no resentment.
WahrscheinlÃ3ch knows Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best shrimp that he actually did not get on the shelf with his coach - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him
"It was not easy to tell him, I tell you this honestly," Tedesco said of the moment when he said Naldo that he was not in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo has played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," explained Tedesco the rotation, which has also caught Naldo.
And to whom the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving to be an exemplary team player on the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued in August its decline compared to the eurozone.
The PPM (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, the Markit Institute announced on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th points. Month in a row below the mark of 50 points, which suggests growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
At the bottom of the light were the Greeks (42,1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened downhill ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone were as strong as it has not since November 2011.
The companies therefore continued to carry out jobs for the seventh consecutive year.
In China, too, industrial production decreased more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The sentiment barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are made.
