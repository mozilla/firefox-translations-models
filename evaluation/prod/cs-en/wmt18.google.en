The civil rights movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri based on the state&#39;s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
&quot;The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to use increased caution when traveling across the state due to a series of racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state ,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it made the move based on current Missouri laws that make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as law enforcement actions that disproportionately target minorities.
&quot;Civil rights are being violated.
People are being stopped by the police just because of the color of their skin, they&#39;re being assaulted or they&#39;re being killed,&quot; Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
&quot;We&#39;re getting our biggest number of complaints yet.&quot;
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has issued for a US state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racial slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling cross-state and was taken into custody by police without criminal charges.
The travel advisory also points to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General&#39;s Office that said black drivers are 75% more likely to be pulled over by police.
&quot;The purpose of the travel advisory is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri,&quot; Chapel said.
&quot;People need to be prepared - they should carry money with them for possible bail or notify their relatives that they are going to travel across the state.&quot;
According to current numbers from the FBI&#39;s Hate Crime Reporting Program, there were 100 incidents of hate speech in Missouri in 2015, ranking sixteenth among all states.
The travel alert is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a travel advisory for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel advisories are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
A model was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family has no peace!
Model Sally Anne Bowman is murdered.
The girl, originally from Croydon, was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant where she worked after he stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the meticulous forensic work of examining the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
In court, he admitted only to assaulting a juvenile, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl lying dead on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had been arguing on the fateful night.
The killer said: &quot;He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming.&quot;
&quot;She even attracted the attention of the taxi driver,&quot; he lied.
According to his statement, the girl should have defended herself, but she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie&#39;s version was proven to be a lie and she framed him.
After confessing to Dixie, he talked about his hornyness and desire for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light up marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was with his ex-girlfriend, they drank alcohol and took cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he could feel the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth,&quot; added the Mirror&#39;s Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
They damaged it four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people on the loose who dig these graves.
&quot;So our daughter is no longer there,&quot; the mother of the deceased girl, Linda, revealed to the Mirror about the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
&quot;Czechs are not prudish or conservative,&quot; says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find designer and luxury erotic accessories.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž went on a cycling trip through Moravia with his friends.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
&quot;Different moles and dolphins and everything was green and yellow and just completely different,&quot; he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of designer erotic aids Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When a partner left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, she runs the Intimity boutique in Prague&#39;s Benediktská street, where she sells erotic accessories in the same way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
These are also designer items.
Wait, wait, this is what you&#39;re talking about at lunch, you say?
Come on, don&#39;t be such a puritan!
It was the Fun Factory store in Berlin, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of an erotic shop than what everyone here is used to.
No covered shop windows, everything done in a beautiful, understated style, products displayed more like a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdenek Šebelka began to think about how to conceive the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
Both liked the name Intimity.
&quot;After all, it&#39;s related to intimacy and it&#39;s also, one might say, tender,&quot; he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the option that spread the shop into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a duke&#39;s bed won out.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first it didn&#39;t seem quite ideal to us because it&#39;s not on the main street, but then again thanks to that it sat next to the name Intimity.
It is intimate.
It&#39;s in an alley next to the main one, so no one peeks at the customers,&quot; Martin Ráž boasts.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a store that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mainly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they entered such a store at all.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn&#39;t even feel like going to a sex shop.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if the store is only staffed by women, the fact that women are not shy about asking for help does not mean that a man&#39;s foot will not come here.
Mostly men come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
&quot;Men usually can&#39;t guess the right size and choose the bigger one,&quot; smiles Martin about the frequent mistake.
Those are the prejudices, the old cliché that women need some big gadgets, and it&#39;s not true.
So a man in good faith chooses, for example, an unnecessarily large vibrator.
In the same way, men choose mostly black clothes, while women tend to prefer pink.
The product aptly called Satisfyer is currently an absolute bestseller.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don&#39;t know which one beats because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is a contactless clitoris stimulator.
I have an adolescent need to giggle in admiration at the seriousness with which the explanation is given to me.
As if it didn&#39;t work.
And it doesn&#39;t really suck.
It is well priced and has perfect user references.
We didn&#39;t believe it would be so well received.
It is a kind of latest revolutionary innovation.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe couples vibrator.
He completely broke the taboo that some men may have, that they see competition in erotica.
&quot;There are different variations,&quot; he continues.
With one motor, with two motors, with remote control.
This is a popular category.
During a love affair, a woman can hold a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, the category of attachment vibrators is a certain loser.
At least here.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
At the same time, it is very popular in Western Europe, especially among younger customers.
What about men?
It&#39;s hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It would probably have to be taken a little differently.
The question is what to offer men,&quot; thinks Martin.
&quot;We have tools for them too, but to a limited extent.&quot; The masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga, is the most sold.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but &quot;more like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and user experience.
In Japan, however, it is completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought that Japanese women put up with erotic accessories a lot, I object.
&quot;That&#39;s the internet reality,&quot; I&#39;m told.
The everyday is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women.&quot; Just for interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the shop is between 35 and 50 years old and &quot;already has some experience both with sex life and with some tools.
She comes for something nice, of higher quality, with which to complete her partner&#39;s life, or for herself.&quot; Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka ensure that she returns by making sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don&#39;t want to venture into specialties such as bondage and latex, because on the one hand we don&#39;t have the space for that, and on the other hand it just doesn&#39;t fit here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy to go to a sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would peek out at them.
A lot of the products displayed on the shelves are really pleasing.
It is also due to the selection of renowned brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awardee was the aforementioned seahorse, &quot;and that triggered a change in the entire industry.
They began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with healthy ones, other designs, different colors began to be produced...
It is pleasant that the design of some of them is by a Czech woman, namely the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy the Whoop.de.doo designer things from Anna Marešová here, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who come directly for Venus balls from Anna Marešová.
She did a really great job by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be made differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna&#39;s story began as a school assignment.
Now it is a finished product, which is also manufactured here.
I wanted to be in control of the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since this is not a mass production but a small series, it is definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I&#39;m going a bit against the flow, but I think it&#39;s important to maintain development here in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we won&#39;t be able to produce anything anymore,&quot; Anna later describes the situation to me, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or dismissive attitude.
At most people are said to be embarrassed.
&quot;But then they start smiling too.&quot; Anna Marešová currently offers a vibrator on which you can have a personal message written, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other novelties should be added.
The boundaries of healthy sex
I wonder where the line of what is okay lies.
Is there anything that Martin Ráž would no longer sell?
It is terribly difficult to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we rather distinguish ourselves by the assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them go to any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request you received?
Just this week, an email came in from a lady asking for a masturbation device for her boyfriend with a six inch penis.
So we had to write to her that unfortunately we don&#39;t have anything like that.
There is still the question of whether someone was playing a joke on us,&quot; Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
This also happens from time to time...
A blow for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer&#39;s cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting a serious illness.
Karl Gott&#39;s best friend is fighting a disease that steals people&#39;s memories.
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s unfortunately true,&quot; the singer himself confirmed the sad information to Blesk.
I know about my illness and so far I manage it quite well given the circumstances.
&quot;I take medication to slow down the symptoms of the disease,&quot; he added, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The entire extended family pulled together to make Karl&#39;s life easier.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, daughters from her first marriage, Zuzana and Tereza, also come to the house in Bílá Hora to see her father, and son Karel, known as Karlas, looks after her.
Štědrý fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him during his demanding treatment.
He has had sixty chemotherapy treatments.
After them, he was able to return to work and to the tennis court and the ski slopes.
&quot;I have a prediction from an astrologer that I will be here until ninety,&quot; said Karel Blesku.
He is a fighter.
He still wants to sing more.
&quot;I keep repeating the words to the songs so I don&#39;t forget them,&quot; admitted Karel.
The actress Květa Fialová is now also fighting the same disease in an institution.
Do you have an Alzheimer&#39;s patient in your family?
See how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament repealed the ban on abortion, the law will be reviewed by the ÚS.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial abortion, so it must not be performed even for health reasons.
&quot;I am sorry that the legislators filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years,&quot; complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
Chile&#39;s Constitutional Court has ten members and should get a new president at the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law repealing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court, saying it violated the unborn child&#39;s right to life.
MPs postponed a vote on the bill last month until it was analyzed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the deputies approved the proposal, and after them the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislation, artificial termination of pregnancy should cease to be a criminal offense in three cases: if the woman&#39;s life is in danger, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape.
According to the Spanish newspaper El País, similar exceptions existed in Chile since 1931, that is, even before women got the right to vote there in 1949.
An absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office as president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world with an absolute ban on abortion.
The others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to thirty years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is anything sacred anymore?
The Trump White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
A sure sign of regime change is criticism of statues.
Americans could tell the story as well as anyone - see the carefully staged toppling of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad&#39;s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was getting into when he took a symbolic ax to the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of the president&#39;s proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
It is worth adding that Miller did not attack the statue per se.
For that he would be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that a plaque with Emma Lazarus&#39; famous poem was placed on the plinth in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller reprimanded Acosta, saying, “I don&#39;t want to get into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
The poem that was added to the plinth to which you refer is not part of it.&#39;
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself stated, this is not about history.
These are above all the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - with them she invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: &quot;Let him come to me, who is down, who is poor, who is barely allowed to breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the middle of full cities. &quot;
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these &quot;wretched worms&quot; on our screens.
Miller was not trying to criticize the poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict over the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who after her death sought to place a plaque with the poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew very well that she was playing a high political game.
The statue was intended to express the union of the French and American republican governments by representing a classical theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
Merging the poem with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Křtitel in the case of Trump&#39;s rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone to the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to a backward world: &quot;The Statue of Liberty steps forward.
He carries the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States.”
Limbaugh, oddly enough, is making an important point.
The meaning of the sculpture depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of the exhausted and damned traveler who, after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, often arrives in a new land with hope in his heart.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the sculpture expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective neither Miller nor Trump will acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Athletics Championships: Neil Black sings the praises of Scotland&#39;s British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the days when the British team only had two Scottish members
UK Athletics director Neil Black said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup squad would be &quot;a huge asset to the team&quot;.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the London 2017 World Championships, which start on Friday.
Black believes there is &quot;something special going on&quot; in Scotland and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
&quot;We&#39;re trying to understand it and adapt - we&#39;re going to work on it,&quot; Black said.
“I&#39;ve spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they&#39;ve done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it&#39;s absolutely wonderful.&#39;
Several Scottish athletes will be aiming for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will take on Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen to captain the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her commencement speech was amazing,” Black said.
“Several athletes, both Scottish and non-Scottish, left the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and unconcealed feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.&quot;
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, said it was &quot;unbelievable&quot; that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Middle distance runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
He will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m races at the World Championships.
Another great Scot is Chris O&#39;Hare, who will run the 1500m. He won the British Team Races and the Annual Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championships where Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member of the team.
The captain of the team said that she is &quot;very proud&quot; of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues made it to the team, but in many cases they will also be attacking for participation in the final and medals.
&quot;What is unusual about the position of team captain is that I was elected by the other members of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team members is even more gratifying,&quot; she added.
“Obviously I&#39;m very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It shows how far we&#39;ve come.
They are the athletes who will be thinking about the front seats on the podium.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she succeeded.
I only drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year&#39;s championship, because it is held on home soil.
It is important to use the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I will enjoy the incredible atmosphere.&quot;
Blocking critics on Facebook: don&#39;t run for public office if you can&#39;t stand criticism from constituents
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn&#39;t take long for newspapers to criticize him for everything from his domestic policies to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, &quot;Freedom of speech may be taken from us - and the stupid and the dumb shall be led as sheep to the slaughter.&quot;
Which brings me to Maryland&#39;s Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on acting like Washington.
Hogan&#39;s staff blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for said actions.
The governor&#39;s staff dismissed the lawsuit as meritless, and there were plenty of &quot;who cares&quot; comments online.
&quot;It&#39;s just Facebook,&quot; many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second highest popularity among all 50 governors.
Hogan is not hot-tempered.
As you can see, he runs his state with self-confidence and strictly adheres to principles.
He has also proven adept at using Facebook as his main means of connecting with his constituents - posting his first bare-headed photo after undergoing chemotherapy is no exception.
Blocking people who visit the governor&#39;s site - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his staff paid with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan&#39;s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying the blocking of comments came from a position of moderating posts.
However, it is too easy to use the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts were deleted.
And that&#39;s exactly what they are - real people talking to their elected leaders; teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As they all reported, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment, appealing to Hogan&#39;s Catholic faith.
Bowie Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. she asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
&quot;I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news,&quot; she wrote in the Washington Post&#39;s comments section.
&quot;I don&#39;t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens.&quot;
What the governor&#39;s staff called &quot;concentrated spam interest&quot; others would probably call &quot;advocacy.&quot;
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would have required sending employees into the streets to collect and burn all critical publications or to arrest or silence Protestants.
And that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to come under fire for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who were denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria when she denied a constituent access to her Facebook page, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris.
Gov. Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn&#39;t be that difficult.
In Washington&#39;s day, the low price of postage had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the daily press quadrupled in number and its leadership position was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms such as &quot;Juricola,&quot; &quot;Valerius,&quot; &quot;Belisarius,&quot; and &quot;Portius,&quot; wrote letters to newspapers questioning Washington&#39;s decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were piling up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
However, he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And a true leader must accept this.
Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, they use more data abroad than at home.
Czechs use more of their tariff abroad than at home.
They move most often in Austria, but Croatia dominates data consumption in the summer season.
On vacation, on the one hand, they have more time to surf the web, and they usually don&#39;t have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi under the umbrella.
Beach, swimming and smartphone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This follows from recent statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, the majority of Czech travelers abroad have more data available as part of a flat rate than at home.
It is therefore not surprising that in Croatia, where a minimum of our citizens go during the winter, the data consumption even increased fiftyfold in this summer season.
Italy took second place in the ranking of consumed data.
Czechs call the most minutes from Germany, where many of them go for work and during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year&#39;s July 7 was a record.
&quot;Tens of millions of photos could fit into the transferred data,&quot; explained Silvia Cieslarová, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Even though Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is only fourth and Italy sixth.
We are going to Austria for a hiking and active vacation, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
&quot;In addition, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic via Austria,&quot; explained Cieslarová.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth for data following the release of roaming charges, the growth for telephony is much lower.
The number of roaming minutes doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates here with a huge lead over other countries.
&quot;Roaming calls are mostly used by business customers on business trips,&quot; added Cieslarová.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former No.1 golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales on his way to the final at nearby Archerfield Links last year. This year, he will act as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club&#39;s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
&quot;I have watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year&#39;s tournament will show the world its beauty,&quot; said Rafferty.
&quot;The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent advocate of the game and is proud of his achievements.
This year&#39;s tournament is in good hands.&quot;
Englishman Eales will be defending his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
&quot;I feel good about it,&quot; said the Southport golfer.
“I didn&#39;t have the chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was canceled a year after my victory.
Coming back to this part of the country is magical.
It&#39;s a beautiful place to golf.
I remember last year when winning meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
Those were beautiful times that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr returns to home soil, having joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years in the region this year.
The event will be his first appearance since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“I always like to play at home,” Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to do well and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I&#39;m doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.&quot;
The trio of players will also be joined on the course by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.

Poverty and death in Indonesia&#39;s land of gold
When Bardina Degeiová cooks dinner, she does not use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses the pan.
In her wooden shack, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, the woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - &quot;nota&quot; in local parlance - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes out the potato and relishes it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes in the cloudy water of a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof replaces a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives, she was assigned no field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late into the night is dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. The village also houses soldiers.
&quot;After five o&#39;clock in the afternoon, no one dares to wander around the village,&quot; says Bardina.
It&#39;s a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1,026 elders were forced to vote by public show of hands in front of the occupying army.
A contemporary movement protesting Dutch rule quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate town that you can reach after a ninety-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, followed by a stomach-churning five-hour drive.
Public transport does not operate at this location.
The town of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool sheets in shades of gray and rust.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners have looked at this place.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that&#39;s not all.
&quot;We weren&#39;t used to wearing these clothes,&quot; says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-woven turban, dark T-shirt and bright skirt.
&quot;We used to carry only leaves.&quot;
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the child mortality and literacy rate here is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is Indonesia&#39;s land of gold.
The largest and most profitable Grasberg gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, USA, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of logging.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 New York Times investigation found that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands more raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in the tribal region of Papua during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture - according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly popular - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters.
&quot;It&#39;s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,&quot; said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources were attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province&#39;s 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% profess Christianity, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or mixed vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
&quot;Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,&quot; explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Pania and moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
&quot;The original inhabitants of Papua - the mama-mama (women) - thus lost their jobs.&quot;
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to tackle inequality and rights abuses during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua&#39;s 29 districts, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokpwi in 2014 with the hope that he would hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi&#39;s inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a big shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas carols by a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the darkness of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the rebuke and the tone in which it was delivered and later returned with four other soldiers, local priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers, in a drunken state, chased a group of children and beat them with the butts of their weapons, victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - which involves running in a circle and imitating birdsong - of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe.
A few protestors started throwing stones at the buildings.
With tensions mounting, soldiers were ordered over the radio: &quot;If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are authorized to shoot,&quot; read an official document, the contents of which have never been released to local media, according to TIME.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the impending danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
However, no one heeded his words.
&quot;When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,&quot; he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn&#39;t know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
&quot;There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting,&quot; he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
&quot;I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,&quot; Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME weekly in a somber voice.
&quot;I saw he was dead... I kissed him.&quot;
Papua&#39;s Inspector General of Police, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only &quot;securing&quot; the station that was under attack.
&quot;We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,&quot; Papuan police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of life and death.&quot;
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injury.
The news of the murders made headlines in the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, expressing his sympathy for the victims&#39; families and promising to address the violence in Papua.
&quot;I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again,&quot; he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be heard.
“Most of the violent acts happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 90s of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
What I mean by that is that we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task,” he said.
However, in a June 5 interview with TIME magazine held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he had no plans to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said &quot;all cases will be brought to trial.&quot;
Wiranto - who has been accused by the UN of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; following more than one thousand deaths during East Timor&#39;s 1999 independence elections - said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had been settled so far.
The families of the Paniai shooting victims greeted his claims with disbelief.
&quot;I have been interviewed a total of four times in the last three years, but so far I have not received anything,&quot; said Yohanes.
&quot;I am tired.&quot;
Years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid,&quot; as he himself claims.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me.&quot;
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
&quot;After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me,&quot; he said.
And the shooting still doesn&#39;t stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The skirmish, in which one person died and 17 others were injured, took place between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the statement of the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers and their response was warning fire.
However, local residents say the Mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
&quot;There was panic, we were afraid of retribution,&quot; 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded, told TIME.
&quot;I didn&#39;t leave the house for two days.&quot;
The Deiya parliament demanded that the police officers involved be punished and the mobile brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the isolation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM) - a rebel army that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai. They include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of &quot;ensuring national sovereignty&quot;.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known as &quot;the tragic and forgotten place&quot; among Papuans.
Poverty adds fuel to the fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still unattainable.
Local residents grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened up more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
The already few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to start a business.
&quot;Young people are moving out of villages due to lack of job opportunities and lack of money,&quot; said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to its isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for &quot;lack of cooperation with the authorities&quot;, despite being granted such a rare permit to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
&quot;Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: visa denial and blacklisting,&quot; he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from the pens of foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia on the Papua issue is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot;multiple and widespread acts of violence&quot; in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that: &quot;In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media is free, so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.&quot;
Local people are calling for the involvement of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people chanted &quot;we want freedom,&quot; according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Another election is scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
&quot;Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people linked to the Paniai shooting,&quot; said Gobau, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a marauding army - are wallowing in poverty, poor education and a poor health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, see their vote as a &quot;debt&quot; that must be repaid to Jokowi.
&quot;They don&#39;t want money, they want justice,&quot; he added.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims continue with a final symbolic act of defiance: they bury the victims&#39; bodies in a plot opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he won&#39;t let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head down.
&quot;What can we do?&quot;
The French Navy has intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy seized a yacht in the Pacific Ocean carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
During the intervention, the four-member crew of the ship, which apparently consists of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was towed by police to a port in the city of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean, after being detained.
Australia&#39;s intelligence agency said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs came from and where they were going and to uncover the &quot;Lithuanian syndicate&quot;.
&quot;We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop a large amount of drugs going to Australia,&quot; said its chief executive, Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumea this week.
Australia&#39;s high street prices make it an attractive destination for drug smugglers.
The country is also dealing with the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large quantity of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, they need to be reminded to drink.
This can be a problem in homes for the elderly, according to Pavla Mádlová, a doctor from the Geriatrics Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, the solution could be infusions of physiological solution, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are currently only applied in healthcare facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
&quot;And in addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly,&quot; said Mádlová.
They should definitely drink two liters.
&quot;But getting that much fluid into an old person is a big problem,&quot; she added.
In homes for the elderly, according to her, there is often no doctor to look after it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
&quot;I think it should be phased in there as well so they can get subcutaneous infusions,&quot; she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be supplied to old people per day.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
&quot;One day the old person says he can&#39;t get out of bed, he&#39;s slurred,&quot; she added.
In case of neglect, it can even result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and blocks a vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, at most a cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
&quot;It is more demanding in terms of nursing, but it would be ideal to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin air out,&quot; said the doctor.
The Torch skyscraper was on fire for the second time in Dubai
One of the world&#39;s largest residential skyscrapers caught fire in Dubai on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
In the last two years, this is the second fire in this high-rise building, aptly named The Torch.
All occupants of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
&quot;We were sleeping and the alarm woke us up. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor,&quot; Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters were able to bring the fire under control at around 4am (0000 GMT) before continuing to cool down the building.
Government officials added that they are providing alternative accommodation for affected residents.
The incident could reignite the debate over the safety of materials used to clad high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged was the cladding and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and cladding system of London&#39;s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in the June blaze that killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five travelers to the US bring prohibited items onto the plane
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unknowingly brought prohibited items through the checkpoint of the US government&#39;s Transportation Security Administration onto the plane. At least six percent of passengers boarded the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of travelers say they have belatedly discovered they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or explosive.
From the results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1,000 respondents responded - found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly attempting to travel with a TSA-banned item, 19.7 percent were travelers with several thousand hours flown, compared to less than 15 percent of Gen Xers.
The most common items that escape the TSA&#39;s attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly passed a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of men surveyed also admitted to intentionally bringing prohibited drugs onto a plane.
The company said it conducted research among travelers around the world to see how many of them accidentally brought unauthorized items through airport security and how many did so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, the majority of people who carry unauthorized items - whether knowingly or unknowingly - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and in what quantity they can bring onto the plane.
So it&#39;s no surprise that the TSA seized the largest amount of just the prohibited liquid.
For a while, people thought that the TSA would treat books the same way they treated contraband.
Carrying liquids is allowed on domestic flights, not international.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on delaying Obama administration&#39;s planned emissions reduction guidelines
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration&#39;s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt unveiled the changes as part of his plan. It thus responds more swiftly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not, however, mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position at the federal appeals court.
This applies to the last deadline, which was set for October 1, when states should begin to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid &quot;interfering with local decisions or threatened economic growth.&quot;
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma state attorney general before President Donald Trump&#39;s appointment as EPA chief, has long served as a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday&#39;s sudden reversal is the biggest legislative setback for Pruitt&#39;s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA executive exceeded his authority in trying to delay the incorporation of an Obama administration plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt laid out his version of the ozone standards and reinforced the EPA&#39;s commitment to working with states through comprehensive processes and meeting the new standards within a given time frame.
&quot;Under the previous administration, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and continue to set plans,&quot; said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
&quot;We don&#39;t believe in regulation through litigation and we take meeting the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it.”
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt may at some point use &quot;the power of delay and all other legally available authority&quot; to ensure that regulations &quot;are based on sound policy and the most available information.&quot;
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive rewrite of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure still hasn&#39;t passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group was not going to give in to legal pressure.
&quot;EPA&#39;s reversal of opinion - following our court appeal - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,&quot; Schneiderman added.
New York is joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, DC
Ground-level ozone is formed when common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are applauding Pruitt&#39;s sudden change.
&quot;It&#39;s troubling how much pressure needs to be exerted to change the thinking of those in charge and protect the air we breathe,&quot; said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
&quot;We must continue to wrestle with the Trump administration&#39;s ideological drive to favor polluters and special interests.&quot;
He poured acid on a man, but according to the court he is not dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
One moment you&#39;re at home with your family and laughing, the next your whole life suddenly changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is that there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was etched with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The website Reuters reported the information.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the Christopheros&#39; door.
Andreas got up to open the door.
He figured there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, he was in for a cruel surprise.
A man he had never met in his life poured acid on him as soon as he opened it without warning, saying, &quot;This is for you mate.&quot;
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I only felt an incredible pain on my skin,&quot; said Andreas.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there his relatives learned the terrible news - according to the doctors, he had no chance of survival.
For several weeks since the incident, the doctors were in constant fear that their patient would succumb to the infection that threatened to invade his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent involved the face, which doctors tried to piece together using skin from other parts of the patient&#39;s body.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of his eyelids.
It&#39;s probably the most excruciating thing I&#39;ve ever experienced.
&quot;You can&#39;t hide from the unexpected light, you can&#39;t close your eyes,&quot; he described his suffering.
Today, Christopheros has undergone twelve operations, which are far from the last.
The injuries sustained by acid attack victims can require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after intensive and long-term treatment, victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
&quot;Sometimes people don&#39;t recover and struggle with disfigurement and disfigurement for the rest of their lives,&quot; said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on the man who had sexually abused someone close to him.
The police properly investigated the whole case and finally tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later, to the astonishment of Christopheros&#39; family, the verdict was fundamentally changed.
&quot;The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be overturned because the man is not considered a threat to the public,&quot; Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of attacks by corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior commented on the issue by saying that it plans to set new instructions for prosecutors regarding the classification of caustics.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not going to give up.
They are demanding that the UK government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people who attack those around them with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also want stricter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in various stores, as they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai Police spokesman, the fire started on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the other way around.
&quot;It started on the 67th floor, that&#39;s what they told us,&quot; said one of the tenants.
Also, another tenant quoted by Reuters said the fire started on the top floors and spread downwards with hot debris falling.
We were sleeping.
We were woken up by an alarm, people were screaming.
&quot;We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor,&quot; tenant George described the event.
Another witness told CNN that about 40 apartments were engulfed in flames.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building fell on them.
After about two hours, according to the Civil Defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its occurrence is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the power went out in nearby buildings.
An extensive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one was hurt, as the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and became the world&#39;s tallest residential building at 352 meters.
Another Dubai skyscraper deprived him of the record the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn&#39;t win anyway.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Serra, twenty-three-year-old Ippolito&#39;s sample contained a varied collection of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson&#39;s disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year ban and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian rugby player Davide Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record number for athletes caught at that time.
The third-league player said he started taking steroids a year earlier when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately embracing her former lover!
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková set foot on the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was then 12 years older and already longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time and she definitely did not want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went their separate ways, but remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both match the color blue.
At first they didn&#39;t notice each other, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal&#39;s jokes until she grabbed her stomach.
Then they embraced each other and willingly posed for photographers.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, because they will play a couple in love together in the new Prime series Captain Exner.
Islamists were given life sentences in Great Britain for planning an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell that called itself the Three Musketeers to life in prison and, according to prosecutors, planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
The four men, two of whom had attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previous convictions for similar offences, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities believed that he was about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean &quot;infidel&quot; in Arabic, and a mock-up pistol.
This happened while an agent of the secret service MI5 was placing a listening device in the car.
&quot;The recent assassinations have shown the horror that the defendants could cause if they were not stopped,&quot; said Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after twenty years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so already after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men maintained that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard it, but then rejected the defendants&#39; claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodonínsk.
Tuesday&#39;s temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which was recorded in Strážnice in Hodonínsk, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, not many temperature records were set on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equaled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday&#39;s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in Břeclavsk, Thursday&#39;s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like those of Strážnica, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnice, the heat was the hottest in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where the mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in Western and Northwestern Bohemia, according to the ČHMÚ website, the highest temperatures on Thursday were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
&quot;Temperatures started to rise there only later in the afternoon,&quot; meteorologists said.
According to the ČHMÚ, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rain could come on Sunday.
However, high temperatures will remain in most parts of Moravia on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday as well.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing loses billions due to visa policy.
For decades, China has sought to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends ten billion dollars a year supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is not doing well.
The state media there talk about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and roughly 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is caused, among other things, by the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not exactly welcome foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the world&#39;s most populous country, Christopher Balding, a professor of economics from Peking University, in an article for the Bloomberg agency.
An example that speaks for itself is China&#39;s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free relations with China, citizens of the others must arrange a visa in advance.
Therefore, the crowds at Chinese offices in the US are comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don&#39;t want to wait in line for long hours, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a given country by 70 percent.
In 2015, just two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China&#39;s gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of the total population, had 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates this problem itself when it uses tourism to realize its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted shipping to South Korea in the spring amid a rift over South Korea&#39;s anti-missile system, the South Koreans retaliated by shunning China.
Visits fell 42 percent year-on-year in May, while Japan saw an 85 percent increase.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve Bank, as much as $190 billion may have left China as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China receives about $35 billion a year from selling foreign currency to inbound tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of 217 billion dollars in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the entire Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists therefore deals a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously preventing the outflow of capital.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general reticence towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, practically no one has heard of immigrants.
As recently as 2013, there were less than a million foreigners living in all of China.
Even some individual cities in the United States have more of them.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has twice as many.
At the same time, a number of scientific works show that immigrants usually stimulate economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
However, you will not find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically difficult, but a step that is being offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and lower the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
They bred deadly poisonous reptiles in the Pilsen zoo.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
So far, visitors can only see all nine newly born Turkish vipers in the exhibition.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
&quot;It also grows to a length of a meter,&quot; explained zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
For the time being, the young of the other two species, death eaters and red cobras, will gain strength in the breeding facilities of the garden.
We can&#39;t say yet when people will see them.
&quot;We would hate to lose them,&quot; said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian death vipers were born, they are the offspring of a breeding couple originally from the population around Sydney.
&quot;The individual that visitors can see in the exhibit is a Death Eater from around Perth,&quot; Vobruba said, adding that in human care Death Eaters require 6-8 weeks of hibernation at 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success accompanied a clutch of African red spitting cobras.
A couple at the Pilsen Zoo hatched a total of four chicks from four eggs.
&quot;Incubation lasted 65 days,&quot; added Vobruba.
In the wild, this species sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of four meters.
Aims at the eyes, can even cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse droppings in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, they expect the young from the black mamba clutch to hatch, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
Trump is pressuring Mexico to pay for a border wall, according to an unverified transcript of a phone conversation
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump&#39;s phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a Jan. 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president reprimanded him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, reportedly saying: &quot;You can&#39;t talk like that in the press.&quot;
During his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and said that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked, revealing a tense exchange.
President Trump told Turnbull the US surveillance deal on refugees heading to Australia was &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; and insisted he would look &quot;drugged up&quot; if he agreed to such a deal - which came under President Obama , who proposed a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that &quot;this is my most unpleasant call of the day&quot;.
Tusk testified again at the prosecutor&#39;s office regarding Smolensk.
&quot;He has something to be afraid of,&quot; Jaroslaw Kaczyński, the brother of the dead president, the leader of the PiS ruling Law and Justice party, said in Tusk&#39;s address.
&quot;I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me,&quot; Tusk replied, accusing the country&#39;s current leadership of trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
According to TVN 24, a crowd chanting Donald Tusk was waiting for Tusk when he left the prosecutor&#39;s office! and wished the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he has a clear conscience: &quot;I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me.&quot;
According to him, he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary is intended to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was at the interrogation for the second time.
The ex-prime minister was questioned at the prosecutor&#39;s office for the second time, this time the questioning was supposed to concern misconduct in the autopsies of victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffins were swapped.
They forbade families from opening coffins and there had to be some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of a scandal because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
&quot;Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU,&quot; Kaczyński claimed on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk&#39;s chances of winning the most important seat in the union, which, of course, Poland has absolutely nothing of.
At the same time, Kaczyński said that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take it into account.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor&#39;s office already on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons for questioning as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS leader Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who fulfills the role of the Prosecutor General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel&#39;s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone against the extension of Tusk&#39;s mandate.
In this case, even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote for the composition of the House of Representatives from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened embassies since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
This follows from the decree that regulates the delivery of ballot papers abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, it is currently in the comments procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
&quot;Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that must be taken into account in these lists,&quot; the ministry explains its procedure.
&quot;In some countries, new embassies were established, some offices were closed, or there was a change in the level of representation,&quot; the material reads.
The decree contains two appendices, the first of which lists the embassies to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighboring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred other Czech authorities will receive a ballot in a printable version.
It is their list that is changed by the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also canceled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk either.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
Embassies in Kenya&#39;s Nairobi, Senegal&#39;s capital Dakar and Zambia&#39;s Lusaka are newly on the list.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation with a consulate general in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
Ballots will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose deputies in polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state election commission determines by lot the region whose candidates are voted for abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when a decision was made between South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs abroad voted for South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, roughly 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were around 6,700, and four years later 8,222.
For early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters came to the embassies.
Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge massacre: activists recall racist lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury zoomed past the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia and careened toward the Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge.
However, before the car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - took a long drag on his cigarette and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers were shaking with fear.
&quot;We want the f---ing Roger!&quot; the man yelled.
&quot;Bring him to me!&quot;
The silence is broken by the roar of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22nd.
But when one of the men throws a noose over &quot;Roger&#39;s&quot; neck, the audience gasps in excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge regularly to reenact that fateful night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has yet been tried for the murders.
“It&#39;s a wonder that not one person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,&quot; said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reenactment of the event.
&quot;It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.&quot;
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic call to action. Every year, the community of Monroe is reminded that justice has not been done enough.
&quot;We want prosecution and closure, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but above all justice,&quot; Brooks said.
&quot;Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.&quot;
A medical examiner covers one of the bodies of a lynching victim at Moore&#39;s Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were said to have participated in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates say that both reasons for the lynching - politics and sex - were known to everyone in the city.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision gave black residents of Georgia the right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And just during the summer election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab white landowner Barnett Hester during a fight - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, the town&#39;s tradition was that Hester had intercourse with Malcom&#39;s wife, Dorothy, and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, prominent white landowner Loy Harrison posted a $600 bond for Malcom.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from the prison, just before the entrance to Moore&#39;s Ford bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
&quot;As it turned out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison,&quot; the FBI concluded.
&quot;It is also clear that there was collusion between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses.&quot;
Brooks was more succinct on the matter.
&quot;It was a suffrage massacre,&quot; he said.
&quot;The murders had a clear subtext for all local black residents: &#39;this is what you will do if you register and vote&#39;.&quot;
The annual reenactment of the Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge event has been organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her presentation is imaginative, engaging and concise. It shows the deep-seated racism that many would like to see as extinct in modern America.
This reconstruction isn&#39;t easy to watch, and it&#39;s even harder to look away, but Greene says there&#39;s a point.
&quot;No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hidden inside each of us,&quot; Greene said.
&quot;However, there can be no relationship between us unless you hear what I have had to go through.&quot;
The main rehearsals for this year&#39;s reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - crowded into the room, where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Ku Klux Klan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
&quot;I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am,&quot; Marbaugh said.
&quot;I think it&#39;s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.&quot;
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, thus Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The play begins with a scuffle - Malcom argues with Hester and accuses him of sleeping with his wife.
&quot;Get the n---e off my property!&quot;
You can&#39;t do Rascon.
A scuffle ensues.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
&quot;What happened?&quot; Rascona asks.
He is confused.
Was I too rude?
&quot;No,&quot; Greene replies cheerfully.
&quot;I just don&#39;t think white people said &#39;n--r&#39; in that tone back then.&quot;
&quot;Exactly,&quot; blurts out one of the black actors.
&quot;You need to put more emphasis on R.&quot;
The energy in the room is suddenly better; enmity will be replaced by a feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. If only to make up for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the N word.
Nobody&#39;s laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Roars, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the actors&#39; bodies and sings Billie Holiday&#39;s mournful song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;.
There is sadness in the room with every word.
In the background of it all, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are practically equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple traveled all the way from Ithaca, New York, many onlookers are from nearby.
Each of them endures the humid local climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until this point, the murders might have been viewed with distance, but now, standing in the same spot where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is eerie.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel by the victims&#39; heads, watch the fake blood and motionless bodies, and whisper something in each other&#39;s ear.
&quot;They&#39;re not dead,&quot; the little boy snaps.
A few minutes pass and Greene thanks the audience. It&#39;s end.
The actors clean up the rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actor friends and cries in their arms; eventually his emotions get the better of him.
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; one of the women whispers.
&quot;We know that the role is against you.
But you had a reason for it.&#39;
Later that day, the audience joins the cast for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking passionately about an introduction to a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express how she felt about tonight&#39;s performance.
&quot;It&#39;s difficult to listen to those ugly words and watch those heinous acts ... committed by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,&quot; she said of the reconstruction.
&quot;It makes me realize that lynching is still a hot topic,&quot; she added, &quot;but it&#39;s called a police shootout.&quot;
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in a courtroom. He enjoys his dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning performances for next year.
&quot;The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to live through - but it&#39;s also a moment for reflection,&quot; he said.
“If we don&#39;t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.&quot;
I love instruction manuals.
A friend of mine says that only nerds read user manuals.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the times long gone, when instructions for using anything were rather a rarity.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one paper on which there were hieroglyphs showing the connection of some components, all of which had some secret markings.
Years later, when something went wrong inside, I offered the document to a shaman who wasn&#39;t afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a smirk, he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He playfully found the loose wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl records again.
New times brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where a sliced grapefruit was simply held, required about ten pictures.
The sketch with the description of how to insert one part into another was especially good.
The set was two-part and another procedure was simply not possible.
Putting it the other way around required considerable effort with the necessity of breaking off certain plastic parts.
My disdain for manuals ended with my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, changing the blinker bulb.
It was simple.
Three steps in total and the work should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions neglected to mention that while the bulb on the right was actually only three steps to change.
1. remove the cover.
2. unscrew the broken bulb and screw in a new one.
3. slide the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the placement of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting my right upper limb into the inside of the car, I would feel for a spring, a screw, with which the cover could be easily removed, and then I would follow points 1-3 of the thrifty author of the service book.
Bridge error.
The cover had no room, no room for even Cinderella&#39;s slender hand, let alone the obese Slezan.
I wasted half an hour of my life, and that with absolutely no success.
The situation was further exacerbated by my wife&#39;s entrance into the garage, which was summoned by a roar and words that are quite rare to hear from my mouth.
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; she asked innocently.
My response took about 90 seconds, however, if I leave out the profanity, there were only two publishable words left.
I&#39;m changing the light bulb.
&quot;And why is it taking you so long?&quot; she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-lasting volume.
I slowly explained the problem to her, focusing on the procedure of torturing the manual author, where burning the hand that wrote the manual with a red-hot iron, then freezing it so that it could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide variety of Witch Hammer manuals, including his commissioned burning on the hill above the Losinské castle.
&quot;How about dismantling that box?&quot; the woman meant removing the battery.
Out of sheer desperation this happened and then step 1-3 was just as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that was until the day when I received a call from a colleague who was recovering from a state of collapse after checking two female employees of the State Drug Control Unit.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced both the possible and the impossible in the field and who can tell even wild stories in an unexcited voice.
&quot;Imagine I got fined for not posting hand washing instructions,&quot; he told me in a low voice.
I gradually extracted from him the whole problem, which was that there was no pictorial instruction on how to wash hands above the sink in the patient toilet.
His argument to the commission official that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that they don&#39;t need pictograms to handle the usual activities of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
&quot;It&#39;s not just like that,&quot; she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of soapy palms under running water was a primitive action at the Cro-Magnon level, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
For example, it is necessary to communicate that it is necessary to turn off the water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end there is the joyful realization that one has washed one&#39;s hands exactly as ordered by the master from SÚKL.
Finally, I have to say that I have been inspired and am preparing a detailed plan for activities in the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, due to certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to post two instructions.
Those pictograms remain a problem, because to create a perfect procedure also means an accurate drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse a certain indignation in the prudish toilet visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has been wiping the hole in question with the wrong procedure all his life .
Pearson is to cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend in a bid to revive the business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change its business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which CEO John Fallon said will take place in late 2018 and early 2019, follows the company&#39;s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May as part of its third cost-cutting program in a bid to revive a slumping business due to a surge in digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said its outlook for this year was unchanged after reporting a one per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to £2.05bn.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded in the attack, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagh city district.
Afghanistan has been hit by a bomb attack this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday&#39;s blast occurred after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by &quot;a local individual with an improvised explosive device.&quot;
The statement went on to say that all the injured soldiers are in non-life-threatening condition and are in the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
The growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a major source of concern for NATO-allied forces in nearby Bagram, according to news reports.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul&#39;s Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people. It is the deadliest militant attack in the country since US troops toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to help the country&#39;s military and police forces.
According to news reports, the suicide attacks in recent weeks have shaken public confidence in the government, its policies and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to delay the smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed its decision to delay an Obama administration law that ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to forward the &quot;2015 Ozone Standards&quot; Wednesday night, saying it represents the agency&#39;s commitment to working with states.
&quot;We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views,&quot; EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA&#39;s push to delay the ozone standards -- which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and use those measurements to set limits that must be met until October 2018.
A group of fifteen mostly Democratic states, along with Washington, DC, filed the lawsuit Tuesday, arguing that the EPA&#39;s actions are illegal.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration is seeking to block many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama in what Trump says is an effort to boost economic growth.
But the new government&#39;s effort has launched a pushback from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air containing ozone &quot;can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,&quot; such as asthma.

You may have already registered this relatively new singer here in June of this year, when this hitherto almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event by Czech standards, at which he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show himself to the public and present his music video for the song Sara, which was baptized by the personalities just named.
Few people know that the filming of the video clip itself, which took place in Russia, was not without problems, and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it wasn&#39;t without a lot of trouble.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unrequited love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer&#39;s juice was supposed to indicate a slap in the video clip.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
&quot;It was a blow, I didn&#39;t expect it, blood immediately came out of my nose,&quot; Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said that the situation on the set was an unfortunate accident and that Ladislav did not have time to react.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the continuation of further filming.
We are now bringing you the mentioned video clip of the young artist, you can also record the scene with the punch in it.
The unsuccessful version with blood, however, was preferred not to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko talked about the possibility of a duel with each other at the meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting fight in lightweight boxing, met for the first time in a meeting on Tuesday.
They were each in a separate room at ESPN&#39;s Los Angeles offices until Garcia - the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion - came down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
After Garcia&#39;s unanimous decision victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday&#39;s showdown on Showtime, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, “How&#39;s it going, champ?
Good luck.&quot;
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
The boxers pose for photographers and Lomachenko&#39;s manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential fight between the boxers would be the &quot;perfect test&quot;.
“I&#39;m a former featherweight champion,” adds Garcia.
“For the fight with Broner (67 kg), I had to gain weight, but I&#39;m not that big.
At 63 kg, I&#39;m small.
I would like to return to the lightweight division.
Again, Lomachenko needs to gain weight to get down to lightweight... then we can fight.
That&#39;s what the fans want.
Why not fulfill them.&#39;
Lomachenko agrees.
&quot;Boxing would benefit from this match.&quot;
Klimas raised the demand for pay-per-view - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko is expected to make his lightweight debut later this year and face Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next year, who has also expressed interest in a fight against the winner of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will fight for the lightweight title at the Forum Arena on September 23rd.
&quot;The fight should be on pay-per-view, that&#39;s what the fans want,&quot; said Garcia, who later said he was open to airing the match on whichever TV station came up with the best offer.
&quot;We are the main attraction.
No one else draws such attention to themselves.
We will wait for the right opportunity...”
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an &quot;amazing boxer&quot; and could attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko wasn&#39;t swayed by Garcia&#39;s praise, saying the three-division champion from Riverside looked &quot;very slow...sorry Mike, but you&#39;re talking about a knockout.&quot;
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt the tension rising before their duel.
&quot;You won&#39;t forget this match.
No other match draws so much attention to itself.
And I will put it in the fire with great pleasure,” said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey.&quot;
It will be a great match.”
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volga.
The pair of young Russians Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search was launched for them, but without success.
And the police eventually closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived in uncertainty that they would never know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the whole story came to a sad end.
The wreckage of their car was found by a layman diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Cheboksary in Chuvashia.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived a whole decade underwater, without them it would have taken the police much longer to establish the identity of those found.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his discovery to the Cheboksary police, who towed the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple&#39;s death was an accident caused by an icy road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing, and further details will be released once it is completed.
The latest test results to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as over 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the new tests at the beginning of this year.
The goal of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants within the framework of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who had lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has referred 6,880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over the age of 18, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged the interviewee to be &quot;possibly over 18&quot;.
In another 423 cases, the interviewee was determined to be &quot;possibly under 18 years of age.&quot;
The tests are only used if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson from the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
&quot;Compared to last month, the statistics are flat and the numbers are very similar,&quot; he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases &quot;the subject was found to be 18 years of age or older.&quot;
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interviewee stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical method of determining age, which includes an X-ray of the wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and radiologists, has also received criticism.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person in question went through puberty.
“I&#39;ve had reason to think about this issue and I don&#39;t think these types of measurements to judge age are correct.
Judging biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with precision, we should not pretend otherwise,&quot; he told the Metro newspaper.
The Agency&#39;s Forensic Medicine Agency&#39;s GÃ¶ransson defended the decision, saying: &quot;In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is represented by the fact that the person interviewed is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all interviewees.&quot;
Trump threatened the president of Mexico over the phone.
In a January phone call, US President Donald Trump threatened to not meet Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto if he publicly said his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would be arranged, though he acknowledged that it would have to come from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This follows from the transcripts of the interviews published by the American newspaper The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of the main promises of his election campaign last year.
In his very first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically chastised Pena Nieto for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured Mexico&#39;s president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
&quot;You can&#39;t say this to the press,&quot; Trump said repeatedly in a Jan. 27 interview, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
They say the financing will be figured out somehow and it will turn out well in the end.
&quot;But if you&#39;re going to say that Mexico won&#39;t pay for the wall, then I don&#39;t want to associate with you gentlemen anymore, because that&#39;s unacceptable to me,&quot; Trump said, according to the American newspaper.
He called the wall the least important thing we&#39;re talking about, but politically it&#39;s perhaps the most important.
Trump issued the executive order to build the wall shortly after taking office.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometer-long wall, which has led to a strained relationship between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the United States would pay for the project for now.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump&#39;s January 28 phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The head of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
He was led to that conclusion by an exchange of views on a deal under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting people from internment facilities in Pacific island nations.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
&quot;Certainly you can say this is not a deal you made, but you&#39;re going to have to stick to it,&quot; Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example when Trump praised Australia&#39;s refusal to accept refugees arriving by boat as a good idea.
&quot;You&#39;re worse than me,&quot; Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation sharpened.
&quot;I hate receiving these people,&quot; Trump remarked.
I assure you they are bad.
That&#39;s why they&#39;re in jail now.
&quot;They&#39;re not going to be great people going to work for the local milkman,&quot; he said.
In the interview, he also pointed out that the fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
At the end of January, roughly a week after coming to the White House, Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
In the end, he described the conversation with Turnbull as the least pleasant of the whole day.
Before ending it, he highlighted that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the Rana murderer in front of the crowd.
Her father was also watching.
The execution took place in a square in the capital of Yemen, Sana&#39;a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari, a little girl who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father&#39;s house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has shocked the entire country, which is facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the thousand-strong crowd that gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The father of the victim shared his feelings with the media after the execution.
I feel a new person.
I felt relieved.
It&#39;s a new day in my life.
The other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd they shouted the slogan &quot;long live justice&quot;.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van, from which he was dragged.
The policemen put him on his stomach, tied up.
One of the officers turned his weapon on him and opened fire at close range.
The crowd in attendance celebrated every shot that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice had been done in accordance with the country&#39;s legal system.
&quot;Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won,&quot; he added.
I stood in Liberation Square in Sana&#39;a and waited for the execution of my daughter&#39;s murderer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana&#39;s tiny body and buried it in a nearby graveyard.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been served.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would go into a hate frenzy, seize and lynch the murderer.
The execution was ordered by a court run by the Shiite Houthis.
Maghrabi was initially sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act caused such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl&#39;s disappearance on June 27.
Rana&#39;s family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
&quot;Our family has no enemies and the injuries Rana&#39;s body bore were horrific,&quot; he told the media.
&quot;Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that very day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere,&quot; he continued.
Everyone believes that the police received a tip from the killer&#39;s parents, who suspected their son of the terrible act.
The girl&#39;s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter&#39;s body had been found.
Rana used to go out to play with other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took their cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the transcript of the investigation to the crowd in order to calm them down.
Apparently, the accused showed no remorse for his act.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the policemen read the sentence to him, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but many crowd-shot footages have surfaced online.
West Virginia&#39;s governor has announced a political party switch
West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced at a President Trump rally Thursday night that he is switching parties.
&quot;Like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me,&quot; Governor Justice said.
&quot;Today, after much prayer and thought, I&#39;m announcing to you ... today, as a West Virginian, I&#39;m telling you that I can no longer support you as a Democratic governor.&quot;
The crowd of onlookers erupted in joy.
&quot;I&#39;m going to sign up as a Republican tomorrow,&quot; Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I can tell you it&#39;s time to jump into another game.&quot;
Trump had previously promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the nation&#39;s only billionaire, according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
His net worth is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, released a statement Thursday night saying, &quot;Governor Justice&#39;s defection is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of working to lift up our country.&quot;
&quot;For a Democratic Party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice&#39;s announcement is the last straw for an already beleaguered, leaderless party that is struggling in vain to find a positive and unifying message,&quot; RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia&#39;s &#39;sincere&#39; apology over doping scandal
Former sports star Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology over the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time was not yet right for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF congress - held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships - that his country&#39;s expulsion from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to &quot;all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way.&quot;
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
&quot;I think we saw a very honest response and presentation today,&quot; IAAF president Sebastian Coe told reporters.
&quot;All members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation.&quot;
Coe said he was also &quot;pleased&quot; that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
&quot;I think today went very well and we took it to the next level, but Congress supports the crisis staff&#39;s recommendation to maintain the sanctions that were imposed on Russia,&quot; Coe added.
&quot;In the coming months, we must do everything to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest ones,&quot; he concluded his speech.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begin on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have met the strict IAAF rules will compete under the neutral flag.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
Drug tests are still unsatisfactory and banned coaches are still operating, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF council.
The CzechTrade state contract was won by Františka Savov&#39;s company, which the state is prosecuting.
František Savov&#39;s Mladá fronta publishing house won a public order from the state export agency CzechTrade.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and requested his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, CzechTrade, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, issued a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract with a total value of 30.8 million crowns was won by the Mladá fronta publishing house of entrepreneur František Savov.
The Czech police already accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are chasing him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is requesting his extradition.
The server Aktuálně.cz drew attention to the case.
According to CzechTrade&#39;s original criteria, the award of the contract was to be decided by 60 percent of the offered price and the remaining 40 percent by the beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
And it was the second criterion that significantly helped Savov&#39;s company.
According to information, Dotyk.cz received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
In the end, it was this that put her ahead of another candidate, the publishing house Vltava Labe Media VLM, which at the same time offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with the amount of 404,900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received a below-average rating from the assessors in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the Aktuálně.cz server, are part of the Economia publishing house, also participated in the tender.
The VLM publishing house filed several objections against the result of the tender, saying that the NZA considers its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition at the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition, ÚOHS.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
&quot;The petitioner is convinced that the contracting authority reached a decision on the selection of a public contract supplier based on a purely subjective assessment, clearly favoring the participant Mladá fronta, as, to the detriment of the petitioner and other suppliers,&quot; reads the proposal to initiate proceedings submitted to the ÚOHS this week. which was published by the Current server.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be implausible and the 100% assessment of the Young Front project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
&quot;Every independent observer must regard such a miraculous success of one of the contestants as improbable and suspicious,&quot; he told Aktuálně Klíma.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
As a rule, the CzechTrade agency does not comment on public contracts before their conclusion.
In accordance with the law, all information about the contract you mentioned is published in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Public Procurement Gazette.
&quot;After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot comment on its progress,&quot; the media representative of the agency Štěpán Dlouhý told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded with a statement, according to which it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the mentioned article.
The fact that she provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years could have helped her in the tender.
It competed for the contract for the first time in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is accused by the police of tax evasion in connection with the excessive VAT deductions of his companies, with which he allegedly caused damage to the Czech state of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking Great Britain for his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls.
The London court rejected Savov&#39;s appeal against extradition last year, but the businessman appealed.
&quot;From our point of view, the case has not progressed anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from Great Britain regarding the acquisition of legal force of the judgment,&quot; Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Prague City Prosecutor&#39;s Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning Mladá Fronta, Savov figured in the Cyprus-based company Harvestor Limited, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund that buys distressed assets.
He should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist drove on sidewalks and in the park, ending up in somersaults.
A motorcyclist drew attention to himself by driving recklessly on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to outrun them in the direction of the Station.
&quot;The police were chasing the man with increased caution through the city, when he lost control of his steering on one of the side roads outside Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into a field, where he crashed,&quot; said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident and transport the injured motorcyclist to the hospital in Pilsen.
Eventually, the police found out that the motorcyclist did not have a driver&#39;s license, the registration plates on the motorcycle had been stolen, his serial number had been ground off and the serial number plate itself had been removed.
So it is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
&quot;The presence of alcohol in the driver was ruled out by the conducted breath test, but the test revealed a positive result for the substance methamphetamine,&quot; added the police spokesman.
How football&#39;s financial rules will affect Neymar&#39;s move to Paris
Rules limiting the funding of European football clubs will not in any way affect Neymar&#39;s record transfer from Spain&#39;s Barcelona to France&#39;s Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
Financial fair play (FFP) rules, introduced by UEFA in 2011, state that PSG will have to prove that Neymar&#39;s transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid the equivalent of €222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are several financial terms of Neymar&#39;s transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family who made their fortune selling energy, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand, they have to demonstrate legitimate sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after taking over as UEFA director in 2007.
The former France player believed that clubs who take on debt in the pursuit of new signings are ultimately cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to bail them out.
In 2011, FFP rules shifted their focus from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential and spend huge sums on players and build a global brand - was suddenly not so profitable.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to €30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
&quot;FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,&quot; Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the buyout of Neymar in a single payment, for accounting purposes they can spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer can be broken down to €44.4 million annually over five years.
The first wave of FFP&#39;s top sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered to reduce their Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams who may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies linked to club owners.
So even if a Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the amount from being billed.
UEFA took similar action in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
Part of Neymar&#39;s income at PSG could be reimbursed by the organizing committee of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 World Cup officials denied that Neymat should become a World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean UEFA will be keeping a close eye on any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to an insider&#39;s statement on Tuesday, UEFA has not opened any investigation into Neymar&#39;s transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of €10 million and a turnover of €542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, clearly concerned about the departure of one of their biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar&#39;s departure, arguing that PSG would breach FFP rules.
&quot;It is a clear case of &#39;financial doping&#39; of the club and the state,&quot; La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG&#39;s ownership by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga&#39;s same stance on club funding.
&quot;It is the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football in the last 15 years,&quot; Wenger was quoted as saying on Thursday.
&quot;Once the state becomes the owner of the club, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club.
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický goes to the square.
The same scene as in Sunday&#39;s game against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder stirred up the game against Crvena Zvezda, created several goals, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The summer team, pumped up by new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening double-header in European cups.
Was it difficult to do anything with the match after the Belgrade goal?
After conceding a goal, four had to be scored, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to raise our self-confidence so that we would have something to bounce back from in the next matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and step up our game.
Why couldn&#39;t Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is terribly elaborate.
The opponent&#39;s combinations were much better than ours.
We didn&#39;t get anywhere, we shot maybe once in the half.
Of course, that&#39;s awfully little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was already much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is the large number of assembly changes a problem?
Of course, it is one of the pains when forming a new team.
We have only played three competitive games and the line-up is still changing.
It&#39;s about the coach finding the ideal eleven that fits.
Are you encouraged to have already played parts of two matches in a row?
It&#39;s still just parts of the game.
I myself do not know how my condition will develop and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, there&#39;s no other way.
It&#39;s the same with an injury.
If you don&#39;t believe, you can&#39;t go back.
Sparta somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Once again, the fans came in large numbers but left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was another wonderful visit, just like with Bohemka.
I am terribly sorry that we cannot make them happy with a better performance.
Showcase something that will keep them coming back for more.
We can thank them for coming.
I don&#39;t remember such visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
For now, we are fighting with ourselves, playing with each other, so it is not such an advantage for us.
The entrepreneur has to serve ten years for extreme tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who has to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion to a considerable extent.
The calculated damage amounts to 645 million crowns.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary violated his basic rights, and the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges called the complaint unfounded, ČTK found out from the court&#39;s database.
The Supreme Court is not another court of appeal.
&quot;As a fourth instance, it cannot assess factual or legal errors allegedly committed by general courts, if they do not represent a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,&quot; the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the Ús decision.
The imposed penalty is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court described the case as extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
From 2005 to 2008, the man was the chairman of the board of directors of World Servis.
Damage of 645 million crowns was incurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leak, according to the expert, exceeded one billion.
However, due to procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to sue Toman for the entire amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis failed to include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and consumption taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis as well as some of the companies with which the company did business are related to businessman Radomír Vybíral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for VAT machinations in the fuel business.
His complaint was also rejected some time ago by the Constitutional Court.
The series &quot;The Summer of Not Surviving&quot; and &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; strike a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters from the glorious 80s; so for the sleazy 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter launched the MTV sketch comedy &quot;The State&quot;); and, of course, for modern times, namely 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd fled to bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a light parody and an embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
But from the perspective of the franchise, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
The series &quot;First Day of Camp&quot; worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (an example can be the story of the creation of a talking vegetable can, narrated by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny children - and could not draw from previous events.
The sequel &quot;Ten Years Later&quot;, in which adults play adults, does not push as much on the emotional level, and the satire is sporadic at times, including a parody of 90&#39;s thrillers like &quot;The Hand in the Cradle&quot;.
At one point, a character finds an Apple Powerbook, roller skates and &quot;a lot of other stuff from 1991&quot; in a pile of junk.
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
Good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn&#39;t gotten over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a freak.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) being egged on by George HW Bush (a very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the many side stories.
Especially fun to watch is the eternally young, long-haired Rudd, aka Matt Dillon&#39;s character from The Youth, whose once-respectable character Andy is now an old-timer.
The franchise could be kicked off by moments of random insanity, like the more recurring &quot;Seven Up&quot; series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical denouement: &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,&quot; when the final scene sees the whole group go on a the premiere of &quot;The Years of Not Surviving&quot;.
Amazon&#39;s &quot;Comrade Detective,&quot; meanwhile, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of &quot;Such Normal Americans,&quot; &quot;Atomic Blonde: No Remorse&quot; and even &quot;GLOW,&quot; a show that pits Eastern and Western wrestling icons against each other.
The comedy from creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, is meant to work as a TV production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen in 1980s Romania who fight for truth and atheism in the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - tenacious Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It&#39;s a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it&#39;s not much more than that.
Some of the jokes will make you laugh (like the policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
Many well-known actors lent their voices to the series - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; focuses too much on the inept propaganda drama - which also includes a Reagan-masked assassin - and it looks like it.
Six long episodes are too wordy and there are not enough comedic moments.
With a shorter footage, the propaganda satire in &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; could work, such as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in the lobby of which two fat men are devouring hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message for the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into a feast and an orgy.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as theirs.
The Russian athletes did not live to see the lifting of the IAAF ban.
At the congress in London, the International Athletics Federation IAAF confirmed the extension of the international ban on the starts of Russian athletes due to the state-supported doping program.
As expected, the voting at the venue of the world championship, which starts on Friday, was very clear.
166 delegates spoke in favor of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF special investigation group Rune Andersen stated before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have yet to be heard and coaches with tarnished reputations are still working in the country.
Even the Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA is not yet fully functional, as it does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can now conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
&quot;While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done,&quot; said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year&#39;s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming WC, having already proven that they were tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start in the national colors at the championship, and in case of victory, they will not play the Russian national anthem.
Bank of England keeps interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, following lackluster economic growth and weaker inflation that has dampened speculation of a sharp rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to remain &quot;in the background&quot; in relation to keeping interest rates - despite the squeeze on household budgets.
Policymakers at the Bank of England&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two to keep interest rates at 0.25%. The results of the interest rate hike vote supported lackluster economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that household budget cuts would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that property rents should rise more than expected in financial markets.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of a mammoth stimulus package put in place a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Funding Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, is due to come into force from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15bn less than the planned £115bn.
Just before the decision, the bank said: &quot;The MPC forecasts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption.&quot;
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would need to &quot;tighten monetary policy&quot; to calm inflation, &quot;to a greater extent&quot; than markets expect.
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;limited&quot;.
The bank cut its growth forecast for this year and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
Expected growth in 2018 at 1.8% remained unchanged.
The pound fell against the dollar and euro after the estimates were released.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter, down from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase will most likely remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report comes as little comfort to households hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises. The bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report went on to say that monetary policy &quot;cannot prevent&quot; incomes from falling in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise &quot;significantly&quot; towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow with strong interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, offsetting a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.025% in August last year in response to the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound tumbling.
The bank estimates that full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Ahead of the bank&#39;s latest rate decision, many were calling for a rate hike with rising inflation putting increasing pressure on households. Three politicians called for an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June&#39;s 2.9%, despite the bank saying it had expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the course of next month.
The bank said the overshoot relative to the 2% target was &quot;entirely&quot; due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase as lenders start to compete for contracts with an eye to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those coming to the end of existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as the low rates that are gaining in popularity.”
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will gain access to a &#39;transformative&#39; HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court ruling on NHS drug funding.
England&#39;s National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 per cent, will be offered through the health service to around 10,000 patients in a three-year trial times.
The NSH agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year saying the NHS had the funding to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as a &#39;significant intervention&#39;, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a &#39;watershed moment&#39;.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Further clinics will join in October and full implementation will take place across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medication given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
Applying PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient&#39;s body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving successful treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexual people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also apply at their local sexual health clinic to potentially take part in the trial.
The program will cost taxpayers £10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after winning an international contract.
The trial is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation at scale.
Simon Stevens added: &#39;This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It is another milestone in the more than thirty-year effort to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.&#39;
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: &#39;We are witnessing a defining moment in the fight against HIV.
If administered correctly and to patients at risk, PrEP offers the potential to transform England&#39;s HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and does not require persuasion from a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.&#39;
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust said: &#39;The number one priority must be to rapidly deploy tests across the country; we must ensure its availability to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP available and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.&#39;
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: &#39;The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the Government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect those who are exposed to HIV and together stop the spread of HIV in society.&#39;
High-end living: a mezzanine and clever design have turned this small flat on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for property, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for a flat on Earls Court in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and is an illustrative example of modern design that makes the most of the available space.
&quot;I used to live with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge,&quot; Joanne said.
&quot;I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this flat in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him and nodded to him the same day.&quot;
Since then, the 1,000 square meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
&quot;I wanted a high ceiling, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based designer and design studio Duck &amp; Shed and used the almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps could fit over each other - the challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine on which you could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
&quot;Steel construction is quite complicated,&quot; he explained.
&quot;We had to arrange both spaces in such a way that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling.&quot;
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
On the mezzanine, old copper window frames in Retrouvius design look down on the wonderful living room.
Gold mirrored furniture, silver lines and a retro Serge Mouille chandelier create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short hallway is equipped with mirrors on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
There are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses by the front door.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen when it is not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution are the folding doors.
&quot;We had to solve the technical side,&quot; says Erfan about the reinforced veneer doors.
&quot;The door is counterweighted so that it swings open very easily.&quot;
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
&quot;When it comes down to it, what you&#39;re selling is living space - or the value of your property,&quot; Erfan said.
&quot;Essentially, upon entering the apartment, the real estate agent calculates and estimates its price based on the living area.&quot;
In this case, it was possible to increase the living space while maintaining high-quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
&quot;The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with the home,&quot; added Erfan.
&quot;You will not fall in love with the electrical distribution in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won&#39;t win your heart.”
As it turned out, quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you may ultimately choose to stay.
The United States is coming apart.
The cultural and political divide between blue and red states is widening.
California has announced a travel ban for its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated by banning its citizens from traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
This is because California has banned spending state money on the trips of its citizens to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop the madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT and considers any expression of disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a conscientious objection law, which states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with treating LGBT patients is not required to provide therapy to them, but is required to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
In turn, Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that receive babies from mothers for adoption are not required to give those children up for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned its citizens from funding travel to eight states.
In practice, this means that Californian professors may not have trips to scientific symposia in Texas, for example, reimbursed by their universities, because these are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example in Tennessee, with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants for the trips, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the trips of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience and its legislature passed a law with a resolution that it also does not like California&#39;s policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He is imposing them in retaliation for California&#39;s travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That&#39;s the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass conscientious objection laws, as well as to decide what their money can and cannot be used for.
Second, what&#39;s wrong with conscientious objection?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can&#39;t he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under the penalty of punishment, when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine after he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But she also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or cakes containing alcohol.
Why punish him and not leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic politics in non-federal powers according to their own preferences, i.e. according to the preferences of their residents.
Then there is variety, variety, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the live-and-let-live rule that all reasonable people should follow, but some activists strive not for tolerance of themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance of others.
According to them, no one can ever again show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don&#39;t know of a situation in American history where states made such deliberate decisions on political issues, except for one case.
Even in the days of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, when the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1850s, the political cause was slavery, and a war between the North and the South was looming.
Of course, nothing like that will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the blue Democratic states and the red Republican states is widening and the US is mentally disconnecting internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic of Putin received a hefty fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year&#39;s presidential election.
The court fined him for inciting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for the post of head of state next March.
Incumbent Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has yet to announce his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his home in the morning and took him to court.
The latter fined him for calling people to demonstrations through videos posted on the Internet portal YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
&quot;We&#39;ll deduct them from the judge&#39;s salary later,&quot; joked a Kremlin critic on Twitter.
Russia&#39;s election commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot run in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant sentence to be politically motivated.
On Thursday, the court also imposed fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, on two members of Navalny&#39;s campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny in the campaign in every possible way.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry enterprise.
In May, the appeals court upheld the verdict.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running for office under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over 500 million dollars
Two brothers are now vying for one of Victoria&#39;s most expensive properties, worth more than $500 million, more than four decades after their Italian family founded an empire.
Former Carlton Football Club director and property developer Colin De Lutis lives on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute over joint property and business assets to the High Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business back in 2014, but the bitter dispute is constantly being contested in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
It was here that the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 brick-and-mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The money has been used to buy other properties and the De Lutis portfolio now includes offices, development land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and suburban shopping centres.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the company&#39;s assets, while his father Colin, who Paul says is a &quot;significant driving force and dominant figure&quot; in the De Lutis family, owns just under two-thirds of the assets.
Court filings state that Colin owns $316 million in real estate, while Paul manages $176 million in real estate.
For Paul, it was precisely the distribution of property and financial resources that became problematic.
&quot;Colin&#39;s motion was overwhelmingly in his favor in my eyes,&quot; Paul wrote in a 2015 court affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are also now vying for control of the existing business - from which Paul says Colin cut him off.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
&quot;My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing,&quot; he wrote.
Court costs are rising. Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have swamped barristers, including Allan Myers, QC, and barristers for both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who had run milk bars and delis since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money raised from the property development, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family&#39;s first jeans business.
Colin said that when he started Westco &quot;in his senior year of college, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old.&quot;
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would go smoothly.
&quot;Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,&quot; she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies. Colin stated that Mark was compensated $10 million and Luke $26 million upon his departure.
As Paul stated, both Luke and Mark &quot;were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation&quot;.
Colin has held back ever since, despite being a former AFL club board member, according to Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and Colin&#39;s best friend, in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded via text message, stating that due to the fact that the dispute is being resolved in court, &quot;I have nothing to add.&quot;
&quot;It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take this matter to court,&quot; he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements in court, Colin said that he tried to adapt to his brother&#39;s demands.
&quot;Our father would be very displeased if he saw our current situation,&quot; he said, adding that he &quot;still hopes for a successful solution.&quot;
On Friday, all hope was lost.
&quot;Our disputes will be settled in court soon,&quot; Colin wrote.
It&#39;s hot in the Czech Republic.
The teachers shower the children.
Public transport drivers pack water and summer clothes.
At Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, which currently has about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery has been renovated and the planted trees do not yet provide much shade.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers shower the children in the nebula.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and curtains are closed.
They try to cool the air with an air purifier because they don&#39;t have air conditioning.
It is also challenging for female teachers and cooks.
&quot;The temperature inside and outside exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so we shouldn&#39;t even be open during this period,&quot; said the director of the kindergarten, Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the kindergarten where, according to her, the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 o&#39;clock, the windows are closed and we have blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
&quot;But it won&#39;t help much,&quot; she added.
They have better conditions in the Na Hrázi forest nursery in Hostivice, where the children spend most of their time outside.
We have mature trees on the property, so we are under them.
&quot;We have a beautiful walnut tree there, there is a table under it, and we do various things there,&quot; described the director of the kindergarten, Barbora Kompanová.
The teachers try to go to the forest with the children, where it is cooler.
The children&#39;s hats get wet and they have various water games on the program.
&quot;We have a handheld pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for baby showers,&quot; Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prosek, Prague, said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
&quot;We have quite a mature garden so they are under the trees,&quot; she said.
He goes out in the morning and then only after 3 pm.
Every child must have a head covering.
The teachers also remind the children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice, and they have drinking fountains in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad to eat every day and always fresh fruit and vegetables for a snack, sometimes brought by their parents.
&quot;Maybe today a mother here brought a ten-kilogram watermelon for the children,&quot; Makovicková added.
Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger area.
High temperatures have not seriously damaged the tram tracks yet.
Minor damage occurred in the loop in Hostivar.
In the current high temperatures, we make sure that the drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
&quot;Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, interchange points and train stations,&quot; said Řehková.
In the train depots and at some shift locations, employees have at their disposal so-called soda makers, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers are also given soluble protective ionic drinks.
&quot;They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts,&quot; the spokeswoman added.
Hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic eliminated 108 of them, i.e. double the long-term daily average.
During the day on Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting the fire.
&quot;Fires in the natural environment predominate, as well as those associated with harvesting,&quot; said Nicole Zaoralová, the fire department&#39;s spokesperson.
Even the change of weather in the evening did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat was replaced by storms and torrential rains in many places.
Firefighters responded to 236 interventions in connection with the storms.
It was mainly about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
&quot;They intervened the most in the Central Bohemia region,&quot; continues Zaoralová.
The help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolínky in Českolipska, where 60 people from a children&#39;s camp were evacuated to safety due to a storm.
Tropical temperatures also made work for the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances went to ten cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from cars.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescue workers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infested room.
Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to cut back on the president&#39;s media diet
Many had tried before him and had always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information about President Trump -- including television news coverage -- in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is part of reporter Josh Dawsey&#39;s report:
“When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem in the Trump White House that he intends to fix: the misinformation that is getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that he must personally approve all information - whether on paper or verbally - because the president can make a better decision based on the right information.&quot;
Kelly&#39;s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have gnashed their teeth at the scrutiny of Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump&#39;s relationship with the media goes back decades — and now that he&#39;s in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
&quot;If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was convenient to show him that there was a lot of other media that was talking about him in a positive light that was easier to convince,&quot; Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico&#39;s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that &quot;the key to keeping Trump&#39;s tweets in check -- at least according to six former organizers of his campaign -- is making sure Trump regularly follows the media that sings his praises.&quot;
Good.
However, the idea that Trump&#39;s tendency to post his opinions on Twitter was ever &quot;under control&quot; is ludicrous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something others don&#39;t -- that Trump&#39;s tweets would be more outrageous if they weren&#39;t vetted.
We will most likely never know about the tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him at bay at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from inciting controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of rival factions, people regularly try to advance their agenda by feeding the Trumps materials — which may or may not be reliable — that support their worldview.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May about the propensity of advisers to present questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, particularly leaks, and seeks to trace their origins.
This situation arose in late February when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the &#39;source of many leaks&#39; from the White House.
Never mind that Johnson was banned from Twitter forever for harassment; or that he did not support his claim with any evidence; or that he has published false allegations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh.&quot;
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter &quot;were trying to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump would receive.&quot;
Would that work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is trying to implement the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump&#39;s impulsiveness won&#39;t go away, and his aides are still vying for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly&#39;s mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate ditch and return to &#39;Millionaire&#39;s Quarter&#39;
Some of England&#39;s West Midlands&#39; wealthiest home owners are once again taking on determined tourists as they negotiate with local authorities for the rights to reclaim the field behind their homes.
The tourists parked 20 caravans in a field off a booming street in Solihull, nicknamed the &#39;millionaires&#39; quarter&#39;.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists are returning after being banished in May. They were not even afraid of the ditch that had been dug on the spot by order of the authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravans through an unprotected gap that served as a road.
Angry residents of the borough have hit out at Solihull Town Council, saying it is &#39;incapable of solving the problem&#39;.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: &#39;They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street where they were throwing stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of their inability to fix the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
More arrived last night and more will probably arrive today.&#39;
She added that: &#39;Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I&#39;m not going to keep paying taxes until the board deals with the tourists.&#39;
Another anonymous resident said: &#39;It&#39;s ridiculous. Just recently we watched the last tourists leave and now they are back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.&#39;
A spokesman for Solihull Borough Council said: &#39;We are aware of trespassing at a property near Streetsbrook Road and are working with the local police to take the necessary legal action to successfully resolve the matter.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or illegal behavior to the police on 101.
This will give us an overall picture that we will present in court.&#39;
The husband of an MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special transported the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went off without complications.
According to TV JOJ, Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He was said to have been hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of Bratislava&#39;s hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from the NOVA party.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians are toughening up their fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will block the arrival of NGO rescue boats that arrive on the Italian coast with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
&quot;If the NGO does not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,&quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti&#39;s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which has been operating for the first year, declined to comment on the matter because of the accusations by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosiose.
&quot;For us, the number one priority is and will always be saving human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the rescue zones,&quot; the organization said in a statement on social media.
&quot;We can only comment on any current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the entire situation.&quot;
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet boat Iuventa since October.
Its crew is suspected of repeatedly carrying immigrants on the ship who were handed over to them directly by human traffickers.
At least one meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor&#39;s filing. The course of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship&#39;s crew are suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm rather than anything else.
The code of conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta&#39;s MOAS and Spain&#39;s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organization said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any &quot;substantial change or obstacle&quot; to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct, for example, was also rejected by the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in migrants disembarking in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests efforts to strengthen patrols off Libya&#39;s coast and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
&quot;In recent days, we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; said the minister.
He also revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on an economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite were coming out of her overalls!
Hot summer days are completely tempting to wear only the bare essentials that cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima was swarming, she covered her little body in a mini overall.
And all it took was a few simple movements and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her bottom.
Her overcoat cut several times between the halves, moreover, it was cut so high that she had to keep adjusting it.
She certainly did not need the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars before spending five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy&#39;s father testified in court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.&#39;
Carter was released pending a decision.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, hands clasped and eyes downcast as the verdict was announced.
&quot;Her actions killed Conrad Roy,&quot; the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility,&quot; she said.
&quot;She showed no remorse.&quot;
But Carter&#39;s lawyer said these were &quot;unfortunate circumstances that she deeply regrets.&quot;
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that &quot;her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant bearing on her actions&quot;.
The prosecutor read a statement from Roy&#39;s mother, Lynn Roy: “Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I am taking care of his sisters and together we will bear this immense pain that we will carry with us forever,&quot; the statement read.
Roy&#39;s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she is &quot;haunted&quot; by the knowledge that she will never attend her brother&#39;s wedding and never be an aunt to his children.
&quot;Losing the person I&#39;ve been seeing since I was born is a pain I&#39;ll carry with me for the rest of my life,&quot; she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in place that punishes a person for aiding and abetting the suicide of another person. Thus, this case establishes a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in 2014 in a car seat, suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case drew national attention after Carter&#39;s suicide-inciting text messages were released.
&quot;Hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don&#39;t care,&quot; read the text messages Carter sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on a family vacation.
Minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him: &quot;You have to do it Conrad&quot; and &quot;Just turn on the generator and you&#39;ll be free and happy&quot;.
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy&#39;s death and ordered her to refrain from making any comments to the press.
The case raised many questions.
One person who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years ago.
Miss Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: &quot;Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.&quot;
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before Audi&#39;s announcement, carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW&#39;s chairman said the company believes &quot;there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions&quot; in response to European cities - including Munich, which is home to BMW - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will retrofit three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
Neither company called the decision a withdrawal.
European automakers have been heavily promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to meet carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the costs of car companies to install equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for cars to be competitive.
As German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which in an effort to meet emission limits installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics of Audi&#39;s engine development department would be arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo&#39;s former manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system intended to circumvent European emissions limits - expanding the charges Audi faces in the US.
Audi&#39;s inclusion in the investigation could have an adverse effect on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen&#39;s profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the little girl perished.
The accident happened on Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica region, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told the SIC Noticias TV channel that the plane flew close to people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach were reportedly running away from danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people did not manage to escape from the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach.
&quot;The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot,&quot; described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both escaped the accident alive and the police took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even feasible?
I&#39;ll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, even though construction began back in 1978.
Even though it&#39;s not delivered, it&#39;s constantly being fixed.
And it must not be built further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, Hradec freeway D11.
The Children of the Earth movement has stopped the construction of its next section for at least a few months.
We East Bohemians are getting the highway piecemeal, like cutting salami.
The wheel will be cut and then it remains to be seen when and if we will even get another one.
At the same time, we don&#39;t want anything miraculous.
We just want a reduction in travel time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland out of villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks drive straight through the towns of Jaroměř and Náchod, which cannot be reasonably bypassed.
However, the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, i.e. an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since then.
That&#39;s why when the construction of the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové started recently and an archaeological survey was started on the other sections to Jaroměř, with the fact that construction will start at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of plugs in Eastern Bohemia.
After all, no one believed it anymore.
Last week it became clear that construction will not take place this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The movement Děti Země-Klub for sustainable transport from Brno filed for dissolution.
The Children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They contested the building permit decisions in their entirety.
In the breakdown, they request a review of all already issued binding opinions of all relevant authorities.
For example, the municipality of Hradec Králové, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Railway Authority.
For now, we exit the D11 near the village with the eloquent name of Pohřebačka.
So we&#39;re driving off, we&#39;re just driving along the highway and suddenly we&#39;re standing on a side road and we prefer to join the queue afterwards.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly congested road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their Undertaker.
What do the Children of Earth demand?
What is the essence of road construction problems in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network practically uncompleteable in the existing system?

Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the south-eastern region of France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is dwindling due to a dry climate and harmful insects, causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence said: &quot;Lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate changes that bring with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the longevity of the lavender.
Cicadas and grasshoppers carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates are also to blame.&#39;
The stakes are high.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced from it is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, underdeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is understandably less.”
A possible solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and slow down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breed more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of the journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
The staff of the Riodoce Weekly meets regularly every Wednesday to discuss news regarding the ongoing unrest in the Sinaloa region involving organized crime, corrupt officials and the relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, they gather mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important for them to change their habits.
Two distinguished journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to put names to each word - no evidence needed, just use your imagination and hunch.
What to choose - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal activity.
The violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists among them are steadily increasing: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven states, seven have been killed this year.
Among them also co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
&quot;The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,&quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence linked to the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, even as his presence is all-pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the words &quot;Justice&quot; on it, pointing his middle finger, hangs in the facade of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over the age of 30, wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor&#39;s office was established in 2010 to handle journalist cases, it has so far prosecuted two suspects, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Murderers of journalists thus very rarely end up in court.
Journalists from Riodoc insist on reporting on the violence happening in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and said territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and no vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
&quot;It&#39;s foolish to waste time on such meetings,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Unless we get more information, no one can be trusted.&quot;
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoc&#39;s headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and shot him dead with 12 bullets, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as Twelfth River.
The shooters then got into his car and crashed it not far from the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors seem to travel fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez&#39;s case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán&#39;s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country&#39;s bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions seek to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of ornate two-story mausoleums for drug kingpins, many of them larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word &quot;ceasefire&quot; means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with valuable ports and important drug routes into the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, Riodoc&#39;s co-founder and director, still blames himself for failing to protect his friend.
They believe two acts of misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
Peace might have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up all copies of the paper the moment it hit the shelves.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against journalists by Mexican criminals.
He managed to survive for so long and all his friends and colleagues believed that this would never change.
He was practically a veteran of the Noroeste periodical when he decided to sell his $50 shares in 2003 and found Riodoc together with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, &quot;it was impossible to do journalism without mentioning the drug trade,&quot; Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a reputation for brave and truthful reporting; the newspaper began to prosper.
Journalists were happy to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was scared.
&quot;I was afraid for my life,&quot; he said when accepting the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is &quot;a way of life,&quot; Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play the fool.
I don&#39;t want to be asked, &#39;What were you doing in the face of death... why didn&#39;t you say what was going on?&#39;&quot;
Riodoc employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his joking and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who loved to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his cap.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also made them question their own assumptions - how do they do their best work and stay alive?
&quot;They don&#39;t like you messing with their wives, children, clean shops, secret airstrips.&quot;
&quot;These things were forbidden,&quot; Bojorquez stated.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is wrong here, hands off.
The trouble is, said Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal, that &quot;smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the Javier thing happened.&quot;
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa -- as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc staff meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that governments were buying to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two policemen find relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodoc offices, which are located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Culiacan.
Journalists are wondering if these police officers are not among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last ventured into the mountainous regions that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first of these is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also shed light on suspicious government spending that took place in the hometown of the state governor.
There have also recently been several kidnappings at one of Culiacán&#39;s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor&#39;s office.
No one has officially released the identity of the abductees or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were wary of writing about what every resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant in question was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that had occurred at the restaurant, including one in which one of Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán&#39;s sons escaped an army task force.
Just a month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez&#39;s column, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
&quot;Valdez would definitely crack the case,&quot; said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; for his slim frame.
&quot;Now all the informers have turned their backs on us.&quot;
Valdez&#39;s office was turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. The staff certainly did not expect to become press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out to demonstrate outside the DA&#39;s office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez&#39;s murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a charred body was discovered. Authorities say that based on DNA analysis, it is Adame.
The activity of journalists is increasing all over the country. Many of them organize protests and scribble &quot;SOS print&quot; on sidewalks and buildings.
The newspaper&#39;s director, Bojorquez, is visiting Washington for the day, trying to garner international support and justice for Valdez&#39;s death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez&#39;s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and murdering them for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to be transferred to another department, fearing that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are &quot;surrounded&quot; by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, &quot;Narco-journalism,&quot; he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces that collaborate with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed more than half of all attacks on journalists on police officers and public officials.
&quot;In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you,&quot; Ramirez added.
Murders apparently work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías, which happened six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: &quot;This is how I ended up because of my news.&quot;
Next to the severed head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to close, such as El Norte, a newspaper based near the northern border of Chihuahua state, in response to the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March.
Others still continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page article titled &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It&#39;s a tough decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
&quot;Mexico is going to hell, that&#39;s why I became a journalist,&quot; he stated.
It&#39;s midnight on a Friday, and the Riodoc staff are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - sipping beer when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people have died in a shootout between gang members and police near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as the many messages left in the area by Syndicate members promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline changes again.
The sounds of police sirens indicate another shootout.

Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature the size of a rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have dubbed the &#39;Mona Lisa of dinosaurs&#39; - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were so well preserved that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and said the dinosaur had a &#39;troubled past&#39;.
An article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is &#39;the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the finest dinosaur species in the world&#39;.
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous Period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved state literally shocked the researchers, who described it with the words &#39;remarkable indeed&#39;.
According to National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its species to date.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to unearth the animal from a huge 1,100 kg chunk of earth.
Once the work is complete, the dinosaur is ready to be unveiled.
&#39;You just squint a little and you&#39;ll believe it&#39;s asleep,&#39; said Caleb Brown, project manager and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
&#39;It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved species of dinosaur - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.&#39;
By studying its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - very likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many animals today.
Experts say this allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests that it was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110-million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering the fossil with his team.
Thanks to the amazingly well-preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a camouflage method commonly used by today&#39;s animals for defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers&#39; findings are surprising because Borealopelta&#39;s size far exceeds today&#39;s animals using the same technique.
So it is possible that the dinosaur was such an abundance of predators that evolution prioritized camouflage over confrontation for survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - for example deer, zebra and or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, which suggests that Nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
&#39;The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur vividly illustrates the danger posed by predators in the Cretaceous period,&#39; said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur&#39;s skin was probably reddish-brown in color.
Researchers are continuing to study the animal and look for more clues about its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta region at that time had the same climate as present-day Florida, and the rivers and oceans extended much further inland than they do today.
&#39;This nodosaurus is really remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin, and at the same time it is preserved in three dimensions, so we can see its original size,&#39; said Brown.
&#39;For these reasons the animal looks practically the same as it did in the Cretaceous period.
You don&#39;t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just close your eyes a little and it seems as if he is only sleeping.&#39;
During the Cretaceous period, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that moved on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been the favorite prey of its equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5 meter long monster weighing over 6 tonnes.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopeltus&#39; body was washed out to sea after being mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada, is behind the discovery.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is also complete from snout to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm spikes protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore roamed what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it out to sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, &#39;finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with toes pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.&#39;
How one activist learned the answer to the question: &#39;Whose Streets?&#39;
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaking all over.
The day after she arrived in New York, the native of St. Louis sat on the bed in the Airbnb room and scrolled through Facebook posts on her phone.
In the process, she came across a post from a high school student.
&quot;The police have just shot and killed an 18-year-old youth whose body is still lying in the street,&quot; it read.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah kept retweeting her wall posts.
Rapper from St. Louis was tweeting about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown&#39;s body lying lifeless on the street, where no one had taken him four hours later.
This is crazy, Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to go back to it that evening when she was following tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched photos of police tapes and people screaming. One of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and was holding a sign that read &quot;Ferguson Police Killed My Unarmed Son&quot;!
She was watching the live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and a barking dog on the other end.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun and pointed it at the crowd, shouting: &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you all... animals.&quot;
This is not normal, Ferrell told herself.
“This is not the type of murder we are used to and can call normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
&quot;I was angry and I cried.&quot;
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they would head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is told in the new documentary &quot;Whose Streets?&quot;, which opens in theaters on August 11.
It&#39;s a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and resilience, told from the perspective of people living in a community who take to the streets to demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell struck up a dialogue with her daughter -- dressed in a floral jersey and matching floral headband -- about a topic they had discussed many times before -- &quot;the black experience.&quot;
&quot;Remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?&quot; she recalls of the conversation.
&quot;We&#39;re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that&#39;s not right.&quot;
&quot;It was out of the question not to take her with me,&quot; Ferrell later said.
&quot;Today&#39;s events are the culmination... of what happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but at the same time she needed to know the difference between the different layers of the black experience and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Despite the fact that I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism firsthand, she is in no way different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I shielded her from this experience, I would only be doing her a disservice.”
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road across from the police department, which became a base for activists awaiting word from Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped deliver it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell&#39;s eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
&quot;My activism turned upside down after August 9,&quot; Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
&quot;I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the documentary&#39;s later co-director, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, &quot;just wanted to document&quot; the ongoing events.
But Ferrell wondered, &quot;Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story to use?&quot;
That type of skepticism permeated the community through many people, often white, who wanted to capitalize on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unreleased interview, &quot;We heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that.&quot;
Folayan has already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, who is a well-respected local death row artist.
His involvement in the project also intrigued Ferrell, along with six other local residents who were followed by the &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; team in the years following Brown&#39;s murder.
&quot;No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our testimony,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;That was important to me - how these people would be represented - because in the same way I would be represented.&quot;
While the documentary didn&#39;t aim to focus on Ferrell&#39;s experiences — in an effort to portray that the movement is &quot;not about a savior leader, it&#39;s about bringing the community together,&quot; Folayan said — she appeared to be the most open to participating in the filming.
The documentary &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell&#39;s life, for example how he fell in love with his wife.
&quot;I felt like I was naked,&quot; Ferrell said with a smile on her face as she thought about the first moment she saw the final version of the documentary.
&quot;But I realized that in order to do this work and humanize black people, I had to open up.&quot;
In addition, Ferrell&#39;s story highlights the queer black woman&#39;s role in the larger aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement&#39;s three founders — who created the #BlackLivesMatter social media campaign in response to the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin — call themselves queers.
“Black queer women in leadership positions are ultimately what keep the movement alive,” Ferrell said, “because we&#39;re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of these events.”
Folayan agrees, adding that &quot;the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of queer black women.&quot;
However, she insists that &quot;this is not just an affirmative action thing&quot; and that Ferrell is not the main character of the documentary because of her views.
&quot;She was the driving force and source of energy,&quot; she said.
&quot;It&#39;s no coincidence that she&#39;s on the front lines, because life at these intersections as a queer black woman is dangerous.
You can feel that rush of energy even in front of the screen.&quot;
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television cameras have cleared their positions, but the strained racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking a freeway during demonstrations.
She described the socio-political climate in the area she calls home as &quot;a mess.&quot;
Nevertheless, she does not stop in her pursuit, which she has committed to since she hit the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
&quot;It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose are our chains.”
A field was burning in Kolínsk.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Near Český Brod in the Kolín region, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field with an area of approximately 15 hectares has been on fire since 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15 p.m., the fire department declared the third level of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to the spokesman of the fire department, Ladislav Holomčík, a helicopter helped extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00, the firemen managed to put out the fire, the fire caused 700,000 crowns in damage.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames at the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine harvester.
A helicopter also helped to extinguish the fire, which dropped a total of six water drops.
&quot;We handed over the site of the incident to the owner, until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, a unit of volunteer firefighters will guard it,&quot; Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning&#39;s DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of New York&#39;s Fridman Gallery, there are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on wires. Each of them seemed to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral swabs and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of classified cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual and trailblazing dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before he left office as US president.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning&#39;s DNA and using 30 portraits to represent what a person with that genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg creates a sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on the malleability of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations as well as identities.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has talked about identifying as a woman since she was young. She was convicted in 2013 on twenty counts, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photos were withheld by prison staff. Only one low-quality black-and-white photo has been leaked to the public, showing a visibly distressed Manning sitting in the driver&#39;s seat wearing the platinum blonde wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, positive reactions to Dewey-Hagborg&#39;s 2012 project Stranger Visions were still reverberating.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
&quot;They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to supplement the article with a portrait,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they approached Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoila Kanunga, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was pardoned and allowed to attend the exhibition in person.
President Obama actually asked for Manning&#39;s release days after the comic was published, a welcome change after several excruciating years in a military prison in Kansas.
It&#39;s interesting, indeed, that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war on government whistleblowers and transgender soldiers, all while trying to find new ways to tweet resentment in areas he&#39;s supposed to support.
Asked about the odd timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that &quot;everything happens for a reason.&quot;
Beneath an artist statement on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the &quot;i&quot; in her last name dotted with a heart) for an end to &quot;self-perpetuating factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.&quot;
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the centipede letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist&#39;s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar we all are, at least biologically.
&quot;What I hope people take away from this is that our genome doesn&#39;t care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg said. Her video-themed work Spurious Memories from 2007 is also on display.
&quot;DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.&quot;
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page from the aforementioned graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging King Kong-style from the United States Disciplinary Barracks, megaphone in hand.
&quot;Once they prevent you from speaking, they win,&quot; it reads.
&quot;Never be silenced.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a direct transcription from one of the letters,&quot; said the Philadelphia artist.
&quot;It gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.&quot;
Manning has yet to visit the exhibition in person - as foretold in the comics - but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room by her masks, her own genomic likenesses, lined up like a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
&quot;They&#39;ve been placed on walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to give off a sense of a crowd,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
&quot;I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement taking on the form of Chelsea and liberating her.&quot;
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff member who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
A first-degree murder warrant was issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County court records.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died of multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
The police were alerted to this fact by phone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with multiple lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Meanwhile, police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university&#39;s vice president for public affairs, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from university campuses.
&quot;The matter is now under investigation by the appropriate authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating fully with them,&quot; Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: &quot;We have been contacted by British police and are prepared to assist US police as well.&quot;
The statement also said Warren&#39;s colleagues were shocked by the incident and wanted him to come forward to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief of public relations for the Chicago Police Department, said he is urging the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
&quot;Police have information on their whereabouts and the search for the suspects is intensifying,&quot; Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who was alerted to the events that were supposed to take place in apartment #1008.
Police described the entire scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
&quot;We believe Professor Latham knew his victim,&quot; Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: &quot;Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.&quot;
&quot;We will complete the WADA plan in the near future&quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
&quot;Currently, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, the WADA plan has been updated,&quot; Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA&#39;s code compliance plan - which describes the criteria for RUSADA&#39;s reinstatement - which was recently published on the organization&#39;s website.
According to Mutko, the code does not contain anything that should worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,&quot; he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, into the alleged government sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: &quot;We are conducting an investigation, as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All precautions were taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country, so we cannot confess to something that never existed.&quot;
Mutka&#39;s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia&#39;s RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: “On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message completely unreservedly,&quot; Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of conducting doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After visiting the organization&#39;s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was &quot;on the right track&quot; to reinstatement.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
The police accused three men of starting the fire of a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in Frýdecko-Místek on Wednesday.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the crime of public endangerment.
Moravian-Silesian police director Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
According to him, it was an intentional crime.
&quot;It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter,&quot; Kužel said.
He said that the police would discuss the possible arrest of the accused.
According to the director, further information cannot be published.
&quot;I can&#39;t say more yet, because the criminal police and investigation service and the public prosecutor, who is supervising the matter, are actually working on the matter,&quot; Kužel said.
The wooden Church of the Corpus Christi in Guty dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, material damage will reach tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, they began to think about restoring the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the Ministry of Culture and the city are ready to share other costs, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution from the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of Saint Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by a fault in the electrical installation.
An exact copy was then created in its place.
The state counts on citizens in the defense of the state.
It will support their training.
Financial support for associations useful in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers is envisaged by the objective of the act on the readiness of citizens for the defense of the state.
The Ministry of Defense, which was given the task of processing it by the government, hopes that it will increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This follows from the proposal prepared by the ministry.
If the law were to be adopted in the future, the state would spend on the order of hundreds of millions of crowns to support conscription.
According to its authors, the basic goal of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside of military service and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would enable their members to improve their skills.
In return, he would get data on the people who are willing to come to the country&#39;s aid in times of crisis if necessary, and their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help associations and other interested parties with training or education.
It is also planned to organize discussions with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One of the possible variants assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that people&#39;s participation should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after declaring a state of emergency.
&quot;The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between individual types of threats,&quot; the plan states, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that there is therefore a need to focus on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military ones.
&quot;The basic goal of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to carry out their tasks through improper behavior,&quot; states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the ministry, their amount will depend on the option chosen.
For example, the office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for state defense up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination center were to be established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns per year.
Additional money would be used for salaries or for building an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which would employ a total of 42 more soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously stated that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of the European Union&#39;s directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but she couldn&#39;t find the right survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their disbelief in the entire process.
&quot;I was looking for consistency and objectivity,&quot; said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based Madison Reed, an e-commerce hair care company that employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New HR startups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee engagement, startups allow companies to conduct quick polls, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass superiors and contact directors directly .
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said Glint has made her more aware of what her employees are thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and polls of specific teams, Glint offers a company heat map and a summary of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing the user to work on remediation.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to be mindful of workplace culture - in case they become the next Uber - which has been mired in scandal after a former employee published a blog post describing the company&#39;s environment and the harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for company culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to tech and financial advancement website Let&#39;s Talk Payments, the value of the global inspection, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colo.-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small spike in interest and activity at the start of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convercent&#39;s nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, he also took Uber under his wing.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable &quot;flash&quot; surveys, gather real-time confidential information and display heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the CEO is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the board.
&quot;The court of public opinion is empowered by regulators,&quot; said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of startup Convercent.
If a company is found to have mistreated its employees or behaved unethically -- and if regulators don&#39;t step in -- it could face costly consequences through customer boycotts, employee attrition or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to increase employee awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to find a phone number or email to the company&#39;s management, file an official complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often an intimidating and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday&#39;s general manager, who previously said there was no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that previously never reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from the actual resolution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment - are ensured to be quickly detected and resolved.
&quot;It&#39;s getting closer to a holistic, end-to-end view of the employee experience,&quot; said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday&#39;s group overseeing risk management.
&quot;At the same time, we protect shareholders from lawsuits by employees.&quot;
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following the fall of Enron over employee ethics rights abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn&#39;t until social media &quot;sparked the whole thing&quot; that companies began to realize that they couldn&#39;t simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
&quot;Before people used technology to track ethics, they relied on faith,&quot; Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, for which companies pay regular fees.
It&#39;s a business model and opportunity that the bold venture capitalists who backed both startups approve of.
Convercent raised a total of $10 million in its February campaign from the likes of Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, ultimately taking home $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today&#39;s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they are devoting their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
&quot;When people are happy at work, feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,&quot; said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if the company does well and companies prosper if their employees are happy.
And when an analytics tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it&#39;s no wonder there are plenty of investors to support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company doesn&#39;t take the necessary steps.
The reality is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can happen.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case, not at all - it can lead to employee disappointment and disinterest.
&quot;Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,&quot; said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has seen many companies over-rely on data alone.
“Because once you don&#39;t get things done, employees start asking themselves, &#39;Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?&#39;&quot; &quot;
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, can solve a problem within a day with Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and initiate communication training to successfully resolve the issue.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining all-important insight into its workforce and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in an industry known for frequent layoffs.
&quot;If you don&#39;t strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won&#39;t trust you,&quot; added Vitrano.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt.&quot;
Thursday became the warmest day.
With 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonínsk, Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic so far.
It thus surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about it.
Compared to Tuesday, Thursday did not set many temperature records.
The heat mainly affected Moravia, it was mostly cloudy in Bohemia.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equaled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record on Thursday.
In Strážnice, for example, today&#39;s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
Today&#39;s 37.4 degrees in Lednice in the Břeclav region exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like those of Strážnica, came from 2013.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the heat was the hottest in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where the mercury reached 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the ČHMÚ website, today&#39;s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
&quot;Temperatures started to rise there only later in the afternoon,&quot; meteorologists said.
According to the ČHMÚ, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rain could come on Sunday.
However, high temperatures will remain in most parts of Moravia on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday as well.
We got such a mess here.
It is not enough for billionaires to have the same one vote in an election as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and since not everyone is as brash as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta, Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejškovy Realisty.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corruptor and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Private Party.
The Agrofert political movement, as Andrej Babiš&#39;s project was inadvertently named by Kroměříž mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter unto itself.
The Mayors also caught their billionaire recently.
He is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the security device company Jablotron.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
However, Dědek&#39;s entry in the mayor&#39;s jersey did not go down too well.
&quot;I&#39;ve never dreamed of small goals,&quot; he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement, for the Mayors movement to win twenty percent in the elections.
Some smiled.
But grandfather&#39;s retelling is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for voters&#39; votes in the Starost jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Dědek supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
&quot;Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule with the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes,&quot; he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he definitely does not go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babiš will remain a hero for me.
He is willing to step out of his world of control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Elders introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said that he wants the Mayors to learn to imagine possible cooperation with Babis.
Some may appreciate that Dędek doesn&#39;t change his opinions and stands up for himself regardless of what jersey he&#39;s wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so clumsy to the Starosty to build his little house.
Others may wonder whether the head of Jablotron did not, for example, fall out with the head of Agrofert in business and is not looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Dědek&#39;s first public appearances did not only revolve around Babiš.
Grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he says, he will send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop at a similar statement.
After all, before the elections in 2010, Zdeněk Bakala, a court-recognized crook, was throwing away millions in all directions.
The political division of Vít Bárta&#39;s security agency, TOP 09 and the civil democrats together came up with almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
Since Dědek is already entering politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then you wouldn&#39;t have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
Dědek crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax benefits for families with children studying.
People with a university education earn around fifty thousand a month with us.
Those with a basic level of less than twenty.
A person with fifty thousand is rich by local standards.
The poor one in his twenties.
In Dędek&#39;s vision of society, the poor pay taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, in the running of which they do not participate much.
In short, the rich need to be helped so that they don&#39;t struggle with poverty.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš rub their hands.
Thanks to Dędek, the rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is still the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not consider the members of their party or the citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
No one wanted Trump&#39;s paradise.
The villa complex had to be cheaper by 234 million.
Selling real estate is sometimes not easy.
And often, even 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump do not help him.
The sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex saw the price drop by a whopping £8 million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says about the property: &quot;Sincerely, Donald J. Trump.&quot;
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the association of the real estate company with the American president did not justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump has had to slash the price of his Caribbean mansion by a whopping £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
The breathtaking 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin features 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, multiple dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The plot also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the property.
There is a wonderful view of the sea from the terrace.
According to real estate experts, the price reflected the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
He is speculated to have paid around £15 million.
He should have bought the property for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new price, it ranks second.
A property next door was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA decided to do away with two practices a day. Long days ahead for the Bruins
It&#39;s nearly eleven o&#39;clock in the morning and the UCLA football players huddle on the sidelines of the school&#39;s new field.
Some of them take off their jerseys to reveal sweaty backs, a sure sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of doing nothing replaces a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to their rooms after a three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the upcoming 6:30 a.m. meet.
&quot;It&#39;s going to be a tough next three days for these guys,&quot; Bruins coach Jim Mora said moments before Monday turned into Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That&#39;s why UCLA&#39;s first three practices are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to fit into many students&#39; already packed diaries.
For the first time ever in Mora&#39;s six seasons as coach in Westwood, Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and practices are limited during the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one per day also has its influence on this.
A total of eighteen practices are scheduled through August 20, after which formal preparations begin for the first game against Texas A&amp;M in September.
Mora made it clear that he supports the NCAA&#39;s decision, despite the fact that it adds another item to an already loaded player&#39;s diary.
&quot;For three or four days the players are under a lot of stress and it&#39;s very exhausting for them,&quot; Mora said.
&quot;But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They are great.
I think things will calm down on Saturday when we have more time.&#39;
UCLA will be closed after training camp, which won&#39;t be easy given the clear lines of the surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel occupied by players after harvesting the protective netting behind the goal post.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges there could be a problem when the rooms empty out during the season.
&quot;The land will be guarded by the security service,&quot; added Mora.
&quot;Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will car park #8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe that everything will turn out well.
Everything is planned.&#39;
Facebook plans more thorough fact-checking to curb fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles for review by third parties and display findings below original posts in an effort to combat so-called &quot;fake news&quot;, the biggest social network said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company says it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that this unconfirmed news influenced last year&#39;s election for the president of the United States.
In Europe, there are political debates about the whole matter. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of fake news about May&#39;s presidential election, and Germany plans to fine a social media network ahead of September&#39;s election if it doesn&#39;t quickly remove angry posts.
In another statement issued in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it plans to start testing a new fake news control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
&quot;In addition to seeing third-party verified news, people are asking for more content so they can be better informed and make informed decisions about what to share,&quot; Sara Su, product manager for news at Facebook, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the &quot;related articles&quot; feature and is also working on other changes to reduce fake news.
The making of a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently starred in a music video for the band Squeeze and was also a refuge for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history from its cozy spot by the River Bewl in Kent, England, which inspired curly-haired Jamie Rhodes from York County - known for his penchant for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
&quot;Looking at the writing of a person 300 years after death fascinates me,&quot; Rhodes says with a serious face.
&quot;When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection.&quot;
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of the families who resided at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it is not Rhodes&#39; first book inspired by the archives: he is also the author of Dead Men&#39;s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
&quot;I was interested in a thumb print on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites,&quot; he said.
“That&#39;s his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it&#39;s like going back in time.
How I love archives!”
For someone so fascinated by old papers, to be supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and to be able to stay in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. (&quot;To tell the truth, I extended my stay a bit.&quot;)
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian &quot;new&quot; castle, going through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities, such as a hyena head on the wall and bottles that had been thrown down the moat over the centuries.
He walked the grounds and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners, and occasionally the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night he &quot;sipped whiskey and wrote&quot;.
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to the documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived on site a decade later, staff were just beginning to delve into the archives, which Rhodes described as &quot;aristocrats of many centuries throwing up their hands and saying, &#39;Take it to the attic&#39;.&quot;
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps showing estates: “You might think that a land dispute is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch tree.
Leave it people!”
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
&quot;I found a record of a rebellion in the castle from 1380 that was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in a book,&quot; Rhodes said.
“The English Rebellion actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they are somehow related after all.&#39;
Other stories are closely tied to the castle&#39;s history - such as The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was sheltered by Darrell&#39;s family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral by filling his coffin with rocks (which was only discovered years later after the coffin was unearthed).
Rhodes&#39; favorite family is the Darrells: &quot;I was interested in the male generation - the men of the time were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn&#39;t afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old mistresses - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to mess with heiresses&#39; heads.&#39;
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that has been swallowed up by nature.
It&#39;s a special place for Scotney, though.
&quot;I was sad to leave,&quot; he said.
&quot;I was like, &#39;Now to get the hell back to real life.&#39;&quot;
Washington is changing the conditions for granting a green card
The media published President Donald Trump&#39;s words about the new US immigration plan, which also includes a change in the granting of a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to drop by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules for granting temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
Republicans and the president are proposing new rules.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who have abundant financial resources and demonstrate abilities that will benefit our country,&quot; Trump was quoted as saying by the media.
Sex bots are on the rise - we should be on our guard
Just when it seemed like 2017 couldn&#39;t get any more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots hits the internet.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the robot&#39;s eye color, nipple shape and nail appearance.
&quot;People are getting a kick out of them, but sales are growing and we have to be prepared to see more and more of them,&quot; Sharkey said when the report was released.
Modern sex tools are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course artificial intelligence that imitates human behavior.
The user can &quot;edit&quot; the robot in his own image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, what is very disturbing is the fact that many robots have their own &quot;personality&quot; that would put even a Stepford mistress to shame.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set various character traits for his surrogate woman, including shyness.
And then there&#39;s True Companion&#39;s Roxxxy Gold female sex robot, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including &quot;frigid Farrah&quot; with a shy personality and &quot;wild Wendy&quot; with an &quot;adventurous&quot; personality.
&quot;Roxxxy Gold&#39;s personality is set to match your personality as closely as possible,&quot; says True Companion&#39;s website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She is even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or &quot;in the mood.&quot;
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a number of reasons - not one of which is mistaking them for real human relationships. What is more disturbing are inferior female character traits and violent allusions - for example, frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
On its website, True Companion likens the Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can&#39;t a man have a Roxxxy?” the page reads.
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift away from ideal or gender equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional extra.
Most men understandably won&#39;t buy a robot wife, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public&#39;s interest.
However, this fringe interest can become a mirror held up to the current modern age.
And most people aren&#39;t queer or violent until the free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights and there is a president sitting in the White House who often makes very derogatory comments about women.
The most gruesome aspect of The Handmaid&#39;s Tale is not what we see - the hanging bodies and gouged eyes - but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid&#39;s Tale book model is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems like a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (perhaps with the dimensions of a porn actress).
Their creators design them in such a way that they are pleasant to the touch and look like a real woman at first glance.
However, when it comes to their &quot;personality&quot;, a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They cannot break up with their partner or simply leave.
They have no work or history. Nothing that would encourage their independence or break their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
21st century parlance: maid.
NBA star on a green page.
Curry is fighting for the cut in California.
Despite a botched first shot, star basketball player Stephen Curry didn&#39;t get lost in his first start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA MVP shot a first-round 74 at the Web.com Tour&#39;s lower-tier Ellie Mae Classic in Hayward, Calif., and will be in contention for the cut.
The Golden State point guard, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, got off to a nervous start and his first tee shot ended up in a cup holder in a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even after that, although he wasn&#39;t as accurate between the holes as he was under the basketball hoop, he still left ten professionals behind with a balance of four shots over par.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t an ideal way to start, having to call the ref right after the first shot, but then it settled down a little bit,&quot; Curry said, adding that he was overcome with nervousness.
It was very nerve wracking, hitting the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I hoped for.
&quot;If you had told me I was going to shoot 74 in the first round, I would have taken it immediately,&quot; he added.
If Curry can make it through the cut, which is likely to be set at two shots under par, he will become the first member of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
&quot;I want to play better next time, and now that I&#39;ve gotten rid of my stage fright, I hope it will work,&quot; said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump&#39;s big win?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide the American electorate and, on a micro scale, also tear whole families apart.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, American newspapers were abuzz with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
Apparently we&#39;re just waiting for them to calm down.
But less attention has been paid to Trump&#39;s ability to bond families.
I&#39;m talking about this because my cousin visited me in New York this week - a poet and left-winger who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for the Republican fool in our family for a long time.
She reminded me that being stuck in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family — including all the Republican siblings with whom she&#39;s bickered about politics for years — is suddenly on the same page.
At dinner at the family table, this is a good thing; but it strikes me that in the larger context it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about &quot;normalization&quot; and Trump, we&#39;re referring to the terrifying possibility that his antics may one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more dire long-term scenario in which Trump &quot;normalizes&quot; right-wing Republicans who, defying his standards, will suddenly be the epitome of what can be called rational.
In these days, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both examples of which look very mild compared to Trump offenses.
With Trump gone, it will be enough to make the next Republican nominee at least normal, which will be a vast improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin&#39;s visit and took the kids to Central Park on the largest carousel operated by the New York City Parks Department - you won&#39;t find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered in fiberglass - the clowns and animals spin and look over their shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy sight and the tinkling music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon become tiresome: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama peeks out instead of breathing atmosphere on you, and the reality of the city does not meet your expectations.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven&#39;t gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn&#39;t actually a Swiss cheese - not counting the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a London Underground station.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds will have a great time riding it, as well as two grown women.
If I could rate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points. Fortunately, no one asks.
I had a similar experience at a store this week when I was asked to rate my &quot;experience&quot; on a scale of one to five while paying with a credit card.
It&#39;s the same at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except that I can add a 15% tip to the rating for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does this slow down otherwise brisk sales, but the waitress is thus forced to curry favor with shoppers when she doesn&#39;t have to.
The woman in the store was smiling and apologizing to me as I reluctantly rated my credit card presentation with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital due to chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year he was treated for cuts on his wrist, which the prison said he inflicted on himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed his girlfriend, Steenkamp, in the early hours of Valentine&#39;s Day 2013 with multiple gunshots through the toilet door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius&#39; six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa&#39;s highest court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius&#39; sentence could be extended to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive-bred panda that mated in the wild has given birth to a cub.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas bred in captivity.
A worker at the center, Zhang Che-chung, told the New China Agency that panda breeding is at great risk from inbreeding.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas lived in captivity.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to breed captive pandas with wild ones is thus the first step towards panda breeding helping to protect the species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-chao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to a tracking device around her neck, scientists were able to observe her every move.
Cao-cao met her chosen one 12 days later.
Intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, since male pandas are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males are quite bad at estimating the time when a female is ready, and they are often confused and don&#39;t know what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement was quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained in the early hours of August 1 by the Sithonian police.
All were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and impose severe fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
After the first round of the British Open, Spilková is in 50th place.
Golfer Klára Spilková is tied for 50th place after the first round of the British Open major.
She rounded the course in Scotland&#39;s Kingsbarns with a score of one stroke under par, making three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that she will pass the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million endowment competition, American star Michelle Wie did best, winning the first round in a course-record 64, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands recall millions of toxic eggs.
The Netherlands alone has already temporarily closed 180 poultry plants due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it says means 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The authority emphasized that the risk is only a limited number of egg types recognizable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in the eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have even closed farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problematic brands of insecticide have appeared.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands were last in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
But there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually part of preparations against fleas, lice and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization WHO considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for a job.
I would still like to fish for another ten years.
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll go back there one day,&quot; smiled the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in Zlín&#39;s jersey.
It depends on whether he gets a job before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia like?
If I had to rate it like in school, it would be three.
I didn&#39;t catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was learning.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I alternated again.
Last year I assumed I would catch all the time.
But in the first ten games we got maybe only five points, so the coaches started to turn it around.
At the end, my colleague caught more.
But that&#39;s how it&#39;s done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Splendid.
It is a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I will miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We have been together for the third year, we will get married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn&#39;t see a problem with the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play into the void.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to score.
After all, there is more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Was traveling and moving across seven time zones a problem for you?
If one does not have a family, it is not a problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done in such a way that you play, for example, four matches away from home and then have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is the national sport.
Everyone cheers.
Even if it didn&#39;t go well, a lot of people went.
Did Dinamo&#39;s stint in the KHL help Latvia almost reach the quarter-finals of this year&#39;s World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results at the World Cup started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell narrowly 1:2 to Canada in the quarterfinals.
This was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extra league.
Roberts Bukarts has established himself in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is about to sign a contract.
Why do so many come here?
They are not B players, they are really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It&#39;s a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unemployed?
I already knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn&#39;t have the budget for a goalkeeper, we didn&#39;t come to an agreement.
Then it was a classic.
We had fun with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I&#39;m training at home in Zlín and I&#39;ll wait for something to appear.
Aren&#39;t you nervous about it?
That was me four years ago when I left here and didn&#39;t know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where I will sign.
How realistic is the option that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We&#39;ll see what will happen in a month, where what will emerge.
Now I can only wait to see what the agent will do.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season was not one for me to choose.
So I&#39;m waiting for the phone.
The government flight at Let continues.
In January of this year, in the article With the care of a proper householder? he also wrote about the camp in Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the key passages of the article.
The camp in Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is about, it will probably be best if they look, for example, at the official website of the Pietní vístě Lety cultural monument.
There, in the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp was located two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8/8/1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1/1/1942 it was a collection camp and from 8/2/1942 it became a gypsy camp .
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including the inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first prisoners from Let were included in the transport to Auschwitz.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp in the largest transport.
There were 420 of them in total.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, inflicted on them by human beings and a depraved ideology.
There is no doubt that it is necessary to constantly remind ourselves of these events.
There is no dispute that the commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a piggery was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy out and demolish the piggery, but this has not yet happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument, and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Monument.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farms.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last fall that the government approved the purchase of the pork farm and decided that an expert opinion be drawn up to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy back the pig farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, &quot;there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them.&quot;
We will see what the expert opinion will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, it could be in the hundreds of millions, according to others, the price could reach up to a billion.
In any case, it will not be a cheap affair.
And at the same time, just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in the renovation of which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was nicely financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is apparently not likely, it would still be a waste of money in my opinion.
Doesn&#39;t the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of worship, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that took place, and anyone who wants to can pay their respects to the memory of those who suffered and were murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let&#39;s leave it as it is and maintain the place of worship with utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should treat entrusted property, i.e. taxpayers&#39; money, with the care of a proper householder.
At least with one like in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the entire government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above-mentioned facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May, I went to see the place directly.
A very decent driveway, well-maintained parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exhibition, in the other an integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own place of worship, which is made of stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All the attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible, for example, to conserve part of the exposed foundations and make them visually accessible in a suitable way.
Culture Minister Daniel Herman could put his efforts in this direction.
In the event that he succeeds in pushing through the purchase of pork with state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already rather problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate may ease symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy can be a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests just the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found in the protein helps create immune cells that support gut resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes from food are broken down.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue.
Once the scales are tipped to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting the body&#39;s tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: &quot;We found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body&#39;s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.&quot;
He also suggested that if the same thing turns out to be true in humans, then the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
Postgraduate researcher dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, studying a type of immune cell that supports the body&#39;s tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group of the same mice, kept separately, lacked the cells.
She deduced that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in the mice with immune cells that the other group of mice lacked.
Mice that were raised in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and they developed immune cells.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacterium - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells evolved into tolerance cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice&#39;s diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, after halving the doses of tryptophan, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance cells as mice, and most of us harbor L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: &quot;Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population.”
José Mourinho hails Nemanja Matic&#39;s signing and move to Manchester United &#39;brilliant&#39;
Manchester United have signed a &quot;genius&quot; in Nemanja Matic - or so Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Matic, a £40m signing, made his debut in the 2-1 win in Dublin - the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup, where United face Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his midfield role alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, having not taken part in the team&#39;s pre-season tour of Asia, Matić was out of form and played just 45 minutes, something Mourinho said needed to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
&quot;He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - he thinks in football,&quot; Mourinho said.
&quot;We&#39;ll help him get fit as soon as possible.&quot;
As well as Matić, his new team-mates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho begins to slowly shape his XI for next season.
An independent source reported this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club have done a &quot;fantastic job&quot; bringing in three of the four most important players.
&quot;I thank the club for helping me get three of the four players,&quot; he added.
&quot;Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they did their best for me.&quot;
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ladi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
That promising picture began to take shape thanks to a new program on TV Prima of the Zdeňk Academy.
Hruška immediately blew the chance.
&quot;Dear Zdenek, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy, because I honestly think I can learn a lot from you,&quot; he challenged him in a video on the social network.
And since the two have been on top of each other for several years, Láďa didn&#39;t forget to irritate him this time either.
&quot;In return, I can teach you Znojmo made from diet chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to drink water and show you why fried cheese is popular,&quot; Hruška dug into himself.
He&#39;s serious about being on Pohlreich&#39;s new show.
It&#39;s time to step up and learn from the master.
&quot;The question is, what&#39;s the boss going to do about it,&quot; he said to Blesku.
But Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show, Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima reacted to Hruška&#39;s participation in the culinary academy, saying that he takes the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Hruška dealt Pohlreich a big blow in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
Over 300,000 units were sold within a few days!
The new program that Prima presented yesterday at the press conference for the autumn broadcast schedule is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his students from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show Now the boss is cooking in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ironed on the back of his shirt.
If my face was there, I would laugh a lot.
&quot;I just smile at that pear - a pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins,&quot; Láďa responded.
He has his own opinion about Láď&#39;s culinary art.
&quot;Cooking according to Ládi Hruška is out of the question even at home, because I won&#39;t let gastropunk come home,&quot; the boss is clear.
I respect Zdenek Pohlreich very much, I even make honey chicken according to him.
But his recipes will definitely not appear in my show,&quot; Hruška did not forgive himself.
He&#39;s a moron!
He&#39;s not a chef to me, he&#39;s a TV clown.
&quot;Gastronomical illiterate or moron,&quot; Pohlreich said of Hrušek in one lecture.
&quot;I&#39;m not 20 years old to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don&#39;t deal with them like that anymore either,&quot; said Hruška in response to the insults uttered.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock his car and house with a wave
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to have a microchip implanted in his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock his home and office doors and even start his car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to use technology to make their lives easier.
The implantation procedure and adherence to treatment procedures are supervised by dr. Geoff Watson, anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam&#39;s company also offers a microchip-compatible door and car lock replacement service. The cost of one lock is £300.
The married father of one has had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House props cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House&#39;s decision to fly a Navy helicopter onto the South Lawn for a celebration of America&#39;s manufacturing industry last month came to $24,000, according to Navy records released by TIME.
A green and white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One with the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 White House program, which was a showcase of America&#39;s design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials viewed the display of products from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the helicopter&#39;s presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn as part of an &quot;extraordinary&quot; event, records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) -- the unit responsible for managing the helicopter -- said.
&quot;I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event,&quot; the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Deputy Chief of Naval Aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7:00 a.m. on July 17 for the parade, scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m., and would remain in place until the entire site was cleared, which was scheduled to take place between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.: 00.
The email went on to say that if there is a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to work hours regulations.
The original crew remained on site that evening, along with the helicopter, and with them a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by the TIME weekly - it was not clear whether a second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this regulation.
“We were wondering if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was fine,” the commander wrote.
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve been blocked,&quot; the deputy commander wrote back.
This &quot;Made in America&quot; show was designated by the White House as an official event and thus would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political undertones.
While attending the event, the president pushed for health care reform that was passing the Senate and talked about trying to rein in government regulation.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered the review in February after the presidential jet taxied in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is flooded with complaints about his predecessor&#39;s use of the presidential plane.
&quot;The White House is pleased with the &#39;Made in America&#39; show, which showcased products from all 50 states that are made by Americans with American materials,&quot; said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of the HMX-1 helicopter frequently practice landings in the Washington area and on the South Lawn, rehearsing possible arrivals with the President of the United States at the White House with the utmost precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings near the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of current crew training, a government official said.
The helicopter unit flew another eleven hours on the same day as part of &quot;non-presidential support missions&quot;.
The White House said no other props were paid for with taxpayer money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was in no way involved in negotiations to display the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and exact costs related to the parade are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly cost for fiscal year 2017, DoD cost reimbursements for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit&#39;s records indicate a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia, and back.
The White House argues that the helicopter&#39;s actual operating costs are well below that figure.
&quot;To state the cost to taxpayers based on estimates for expense reimbursements is very misleading,&quot; Walters said of the matter.
&quot;These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost.&quot;
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursements do not include personnel costs, but do include the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contract costs.
Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the parade.
&quot;The idea behind this week&#39;s show is to showcase products made in the U.S.,&quot; Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut take great pride in contributing to the defense of our state and employing hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens have a hand in producing.
This fact deserves to be remembered.”
It&#39;s unclear if Trump also went to see the helicopter during his tour of the South Lawn. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that he got behind the wheel of one of the fire engines.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
&quot;I know Sikorsky very well,&quot; said the president, &quot;I own three myself.&quot;
A young woman got stuck in a swamp near Mách&#39;s lake, the police waded to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around two o&#39;clock in the morning.
But instead of swimming, she remained trapped in the swamps.
When she decided to use her cell phone to call the police for help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery left.
&quot;For that reason, the police soon lost contact with her,&quot; said police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols went to the place she approximately described, but finding the young woman was not at all easy.
&quot;Some of the police officers had to wade through reed swamps for hundreds of meters before they felt solid ground under their feet again,&quot; explained Baláková.
And she was missing in a similar way.
The police oriented themselves according to the direction from which her call for help came.
&quot;In order not to lose at least this connection, they arranged with her to count down loudly,&quot; the spokeswoman said.
The police did not find the woman until a quarter to five in the swamps in the Borný locality.
She was at the brink of physical and mental strength and was showing signs of hypothermia.
That&#39;s why the ambulance that was called took her to the Českolip hospital.
Grandpa&#39;s connection to STAN?
A desirable bride becomes a marketable girl.
That&#39;s a bit ironic.
With his web project hledameslusny.cz, it is as if the billionaire basically told the voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that the politically disparate group of lesser-known mayors and independents actually has no national program for the parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after the interview with Dędek, regardless of his political opinion.
Vít Bárta used to start like this too, and it didn&#39;t turn out very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidate lists, which Gazdík also admitted, Dědek also nullifies the favorite argument of the head of STAN, that the movement&#39;s greatest value is precisely the politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to surveys.
They will now easily be replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
Gazdík also explained the total break with the People&#39;s Party, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the People&#39;s Party&#39;s candidates.
But if only a few people suspected STAN&#39;s identity back then, after the arrival of Dędek, even the mere game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has been opposing Andrej Babiš&#39;s ANO for a long time, but Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated the following on the first joint press release: &quot;My goal is for the ANO movement, i.e. the Mayors&#39; movement, to win twenty percent in the upcoming elections.&quot;
Let&#39;s hope you haven&#39;t confused the movement.
Grandfather is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly no accident.
He often talks about politics in a similar way to Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party for some time now, and Dědek&#39;s helping hand seems to make the desired bride even more of a marketable girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with Lidovci, and now he is looking for decent people for a change.
Hopefully someone will respond.
Police dogs practiced helicopter flyovers in Most
Dogs specialized in the search for explosives and search dogs practiced helicopter flyovers at Lake Most today.
A police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both adult trained dogs and those still undergoing training practiced.
In addition to the standard training, during which they had to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and look for a lost extra, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter ride.
&quot;The helicopter lands, the dog goes and immediately searches,&quot; said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or is unable to start working immediately after the helicopter ride is excluded from training.
&quot;The dog handlers usually keep them in the garden, for example,&quot; Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specializations in the Ústí Region.
German shepherds predominate, but Belgian shepherds are also increasing.
The handler has been taking care of him since he was a puppy.
&quot;He is raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us,&quot; Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can reveal any health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, it passes the first tests at 20 months.
&quot;It takes around two and a half to three years to get into a sharp intervention,&quot; Tomášek added.
The length of service with the police depends on the dog&#39;s health.
They mostly serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their handlers.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar&#39;s Out and the Cali Cartel Takes Center Stage on Netflix&#39;s Hit Series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar&#39;s killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service - the former has already received its first trailer and an outline of other villains.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, they operate &quot;like a Fortune 500 company&quot;, except that they escalate violent acts and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the mastermind of the operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.

The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, a senior official at the UN Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women are participating in local council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
&quot;The role of women cannot be overlooked,&quot; he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as in all the related processes that are connected to the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued several threats against the electoral process, which puts international fighting on the back burner.
In this year&#39;s elections, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government peacefully hands over its power to the next government.
Haysom said a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan&#39;s democracy.
Afghanistan&#39;s Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million were women.
The unique brewery is brewing beer again.
For a good beer at the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobč u Mšena back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time already in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted to steam engine operation in the nineteenth century.
The boom years followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during the Second World War and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served as a state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and dismantled for construction material.
In 2007, however, new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzová.
They began to repair the buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery thus has the same appearance as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era started.
Their work was recognized by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the building also became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they ceremonially renewed the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque landscape of the Kokořín region, visit the tap on the premises of the brewery.
When brewing beer here, they use Kokořín water springing from a protected landscape area, malt from Lobeč fields and Žatec hops.
In the taproom, you can taste traditional light lager, as well as dark beers and specials.
And don&#39;t miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and half past two.
The biggest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique structure should have been the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by an extensive underground.
Here was to be the headquarters, barracks, ammunition and material stores, power plant, engine room and hospital.
But the construction was ended by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and the underground spaces were broken out.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who started to reconstruct the unique building in the early nineties, you too can take a look.
The underground is already 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the TS 73 infantry cabin with an exhibition and underground, the area also includes an armed object of light fortification, as well as two infantry cabins under construction, trenches and the Fortified Trutnovsko educational trail.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building made the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan&#39;s Port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chotěšov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today mainly consists of a massive four-winged convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list on which it was placed, however, unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are at risk of extinction.
But the enthusiasts don&#39;t want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Dinner for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where Vladimír Mišík and Ivan Hlas will perform, you will see fencing performances and you will see places of the wonderful vast building that are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant in one click.
The new free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbariums as well as ordinary plant lovers.
When they are wondering what plant they just came across on a walk, this application will advise them.
All they have to do is take a photo of the plant and the app will automatically recognize what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava&#39;s Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, and together with their teachers, they took photos and added plants from their surroundings to the database of the application.
The newly created French application is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute their images to the application, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
&quot;Already children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hand can go into the forest,&quot; said the coordinator of this project, Ivana Poláčková.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which it then assigns under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute an image of a plant that is not yet in the database after creating an account in the application.
&quot;The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database,&quot; informed Poláčková.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie&#39;s factory in Glasgow
Unions are seeking assurances from managers at biscuit maker McVitie&#39;s about a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent on the potential investment in the Tollcross factory for now.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, producing Hobnob biscuits and Rich Tea, among other products.
The owner of McVitie&#39;s, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5m in the area over the previous few years.
She added that employees and union representatives would be &quot;among the first to be notified&quot; of any changes to factory operations.
In a letter to the company&#39;s construction manager, the Scottish union GMB expressed its concerns that McVitie&#39;s &quot;will not deliver on its promises to finance and modernize production lines.&quot;
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the site manager regarding the needs of the company and the future plan for investment in Tollcross is of great concern to our members.
Generations of many families have worked here and the workforce is mostly drawn from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
From a work, pay and benefit perspective - and despite the prospect of Brexit, the rising cost of living and falling slow manufacturing - Glasgow East desperately needs a thriving manufacturer like McVitie&#39;s.&quot;
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Construction manager Tollcross only received the letter from GMB yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we value the continued commitment to staff and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives at Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We have discussed with employees that, as with all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all of our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “We have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area in recent years, particularly in production lines and operational efficiencies.
We greatly value the heritage of Tollcross and the locality and any changes to the operation of the factory here will be communicated to staff and union representatives immediately.&quot;
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won&#39;t let up in their bid to sign Neymar after paying £189m, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of his contract, but did the French side warn Barcelona of their record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the summer transfer waters. The Ligue 1 club are poised to more than double the previous record fee for Paul Pogba&#39;s move to Manchester United, who paid £89m for him last season.
Once the transfer is confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the world&#39;s most expensive player as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - earning over £500,000 a week from PSG after tax.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has bailed out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming the club have always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club interested in signing one of PSG&#39;s best players.
&quot;I&#39;m not worried because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely go for one of their players,&quot; said Al-Khelaifi.
&quot;We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences.”
Barcelona appear to have crossed an imaginary line when they expressed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian international to leave under any circumstances. So it is possible that Barcelona are now swallowing a bitter pill for their bold actions with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump gave a nod to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it will not continue like this.
Even from this, the idea of sanctions is like straw from shoes.
You can&#39;t throw those things in one bag.
Maduro&#39;s Venezuela has really set out on the path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China just isn&#39;t behaving the way the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter unto itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even an ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, would understand what the sanctions policy is based on and what system of rules it is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only following up on what President Obama had already prepared, he just put his stamp of approval on it.
So why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, he would hug Putin and lift sanctions.
A terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not loosening, but tightening.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German minister Zypries says Trump&#39;s sanctions violate international law.
It&#39;s like only sanctions approved by the UN Security Council are kosher?
But then the EU&#39;s anti-Russian sanctions are not kosher either.
In turn, the head of the European Commission, Juncker, complains that Trump&#39;s sanctions threaten the EU&#39;s energy security.
It&#39;s like sanctions should be used only so weak that they don&#39;t endanger anyone?
The common voter fumbles.
For three years he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the fulfillment of the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire in Ukraine.
Now he learns that it is about the energy security of the EU.
The voter is also wider.
Sanctions are coming to Russia for mounting too much where it doesn&#39;t belong.
China is blamed for not assembling much.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country&#39;s borders.
All those punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, order or rules in it?
Andrej Babiš: I am not thinking about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, is touring the republic with his visionary book and is finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, he has already completed all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not significantly interfere with them.
He even agreed that the Moravian-Silesian party would be led by the ANO governor and shadow minister of education Ivo Vondrák.
&quot;However, if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor,&quot; Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You angered many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should manage municipalities and cities alone, with only managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn&#39;t like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book, I don&#39;t talk about interfering with representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
During the presentation of your book What I Dream About When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard with my own ears that you talked about the abolition of councils.
I don&#39;t remember that.
I talked about direct election and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1,171 representatives.
And the mayor is blamed for building too little and not preparing big projects, but she doesn&#39;t have the competence for that.
The same applies to the government, which in our history was run by only two people, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
But the current prime minister does not manage anything, he only moderates the debate.
That can&#39;t work.
Is that why you want to enforce a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it will be difficult to achieve.
In the program, we only have a change to a single-round election for the Senate.
We also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the rules of procedure of the Chamber of Deputies to prevent unnecessary exhibitions by MPs, who are supposed to work mainly in commissions and committees, not to show off at Chamber meetings.
It is definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that&#39;s exactly what your opponents fear.
That you will run the government as a dictator, control the Chamber of Deputies with 101 deputies, abolish the regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will control the whole country.
That&#39;s definitely not the case.
After all, there is nothing wrong with debating the number of deputies.
French President Macron announced the reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 Frenchmen per legislator, while in our country it comes to 17,000 Czechs.
However, nobody accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone were to win the elections in the Czech Republic with a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
However, the temptations for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team that will work for the people in the government, not for their parties or departments.
I don&#39;t understand, for example, why we couldn&#39;t agree on the fact that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they overvote me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on that as prime minister?
The prime minister should intervene when the ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency and would like to use the state&#39;s money to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government, they are supposed to voice their disagreements outside it.
The finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition rifts, power voting and trades, that is where decisions are to be made.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when the ministers behave mainly in partisan ways?
Constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply and kicked Babiš out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has management skills, there is no need for such empty gestures.
He measures everyone equally and demands perfect performance from everyone.
Do you already know who you would suggest for finance minister?
I don&#39;t think about it at all, after all, we probably won&#39;t even be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even if I don&#39;t know what I did so terrible.
So much skepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have won the businessman Dědek, who would like to work with you, the wing of Jiří Čunk, who is inclined towards you, may win among the People&#39;s Party.
I do not think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not be opposed, may gain ground in the ODS.
I would leave that up to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-Chairman of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura&#39;s SPD, for example in the area of the economy.
So the Okamurians come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims that he did not say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he obtained money from Úsvit for his company, there was a coup there.
He is, of course, a distinctive personality.
But somewhat brownish.
If I take his program, he has broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, one can agree with that.
I&#39;m not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views, speaks at demonstrations with gallows and wants to leave the EU is acceptable to you?
We are not considering cooperation with Mr. Okamura&#39;s party, I can&#39;t imagine it.
It is obvious that he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the communists&#39; tacit support for your minority government?
I can&#39;t even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the runner-up, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the runner-up.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the program of the coalition government.
Let&#39;s get back to your attempt to run the state like a business.
But the government simply has to obey, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, he never made a decision.
Coalition affairs such as ČEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also the reason why he fired me.
Once he did, CEZ took control of the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by CEZ management, which dictates to the Minister of Finance how he should vote at CEZ&#39;s general meeting.
If you were to become prime minister, would you change the personnel conditions in the supervisory board and replace the top management of ČEZ?
Holy Mary, if I&#39;m prime minister, we&#39;ll see.
I&#39;m not yet.
There are rumors that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange the good cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.
So maybe after the elections, everything will go on again.
I know nothing about it.
I have no lobbyist Pokorný or Růžička, I am an independent unit and I do not deal with this at all.
So answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to change the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing whatever he wants for years thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to find the statements of Mr. Schwarzenberg.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never managed it, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
It&#39;s a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ should take Dukovany, value them, push them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, hold a supplier competition or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear units is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purposeful campaign against me, but I don&#39;t have and won&#39;t have any authority to fire anyone.
But control yes.
I don&#39;t want to dominate anyone.
I&#39;m just saying that citizens pay roughly 7.2 billion a year in fees for public radio and television, but they don&#39;t really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don&#39;t know?
After all, the House approves a report on their management, which has a direct effect on the positions of the CEOs of CT and CRo.
Look at how the news is being discussed, that super power Sobotka Kalousek pact that has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigative files and to the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he allowed himself to be pressured by Kalouska to throw me out of the government, which added TOP 09 percentages, but the ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of the disruption of their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you think of the articles describing how the first vice-chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek, is building a powerful background by appointing his son to the supervisory board of the Brno Thermal Power Plant and arranging contracts with the related lawyer Květoslav Hlín with municipal and state companies, such as the Prague Transport Company or České dráhy?
This is where we have an ongoing dispute.
I don&#39;t like it and I scolded him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works for significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn&#39;t do that.
I had no one as finance minister.
We, unlike the Socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílova, Březina.
If there was any hint of clientelism with us, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like that happened, we&#39;d get rid of anybody, it didn&#39;t matter who it was.
