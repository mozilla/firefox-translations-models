Petr Čech: Transfer at the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big move.
The next chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently Chelsea&#39;s substitute goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talking to Czech journalists and preparing with the Czech national team for a game warm-up with the Americans and then also for a sharp start of the qualification for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
Thibaut Courtois is given priority in Chelsea&#39;s goal in the new Premier League season, the Czech got into the substitute position for the first time in ten years at the London club.
Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Cech.
At the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in a duel with Atlético and did not even manage to enter the league season, losing 2:4 in San Sebastián.
Paris SG has also been speculated to be interested.
He started the season of the French league with two wins and two draws, on Sunday he shot St. Etienne 5:0.
Relatively, the club AS Monaco is pushing the shoe the most.
He has a record of 1-1-2 in the league so far, and at the weekend he parted ways amicably with Lille 1:1.
News popped up on the tabloid English websites today that they might want Cech at Queens Park Rangers.
But according to English bookmakers, Cech&#39;s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet posted odds of 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible for you to change your jersey in the remaining few hours?
I don&#39;t count on it, but nothing is ever 100% in football.
Perhaps during the day an offer will come that cannot be refused.
What should such an offer look like?
(laughs) &quot;Well, I still don&#39;t know what such an offer, which cannot be refused, actually looks like.
All parties would have to come to an agreement. First of all, it would depend on Chelsea&#39;s attitude, whether the club would deal with the possible offer or not.
Is it even technically feasible to make such a transfer while you are now in Prague?
Wouldn&#39;t it be necessary for you to sign a possible new contract somewhere in the new workplace?
So I didn&#39;t think about it.
But there are a lot of players in such a situation today, they are all somewhere at national team meetings, and there will definitely be a lot of transfers closed today.
So it would certainly be feasible somehow.
How many clubs on the planet could afford you?
Well, I really don&#39;t know.
And you are not pushing to leave?
The situation where I did not catch in the first three games of the new season is new for me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and leave somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in the battle for the Chelsea goalkeeper position and it is up to the coach who he chooses and what decisions he makes in the coming weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all factors into account.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, which of course includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible that you would catch for another club in England?
This is a question I thought would never be asked of me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don&#39;t want to rule anything out.
I do not know the answer.
The Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
New Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo for a meeting with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe. In his first major visit since winning the election in May, he is to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world&#39;s third-largest economy.
First on the list are plans for more extensive cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to reporters, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it sped at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h maximum speed zone and drove into the bush to elude the police.
Traffic police on patrol attempted to stop a blue motorbike on the shoulder of the road in Karrata this morning when they noticed it was traveling at 125km/h as it exited a service station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued down Burgess Road before turning into bushland, causing officers to lose sight of him.
The motorbike and a person matching the driver&#39;s description were then seen at a home in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath Police have charged the 20-year-old with failing to obey a call to stop and careless driving.
He will stand trial in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was impounded for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will stand trial accused of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was told of the charges during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He is alleged to have raped a woman at Scotland&#39;s Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
According to the claim, Webster assaulted her while she was &quot;unconscious, asleep, and in no condition to give her consent.&quot;
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set a retrial date for November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Reviving the very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right.
&quot;The way unions work, middle-class jobs work,&quot; says Ellison, the Democratic senator from Minnesota who co-chairs the congressional committee.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m so proud to co-introduce the Workers&#39; Empowerment Act with occasional rights paragon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to defend against union organizing discrimination as other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Amending the Labor Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join a union to sue in civil court - and be awarded compensation or damages - is a right and necessary initiative.
But it&#39;s certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents are proposing in the bill is to revisit the American ideal.
Despite the union battles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it, when the country championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of assembly in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja&#39;s military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
Convinced that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included language and openly recognized that &quot;the right of workers to assemble, bargain collectively, and act is guaranteed.&quot;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler&#39;s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and assert themselves in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that bluntly stated: &quot;The right to form associations to secure and improve labor and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and every occupation or profession.&quot;
Arrangements that limit this right or seek to impair it will be void. Measures leading to the fulfillment of such a purpose are illegal.
When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the drafters and Roosevelt included the guarantee that &quot;everyone has the right to the protection of his interests form and join unions.&#39;
Americans for generations have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to form labor unions - and to participate in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and assert themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone knows today that trade unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to unimagined levels.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn&#39;t forget and neither should we.
Formal recognition of labor rights as human - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination in union organizing - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restore the ideals that raised America and made it the true promise of democracy.
A judge has temporarily blocked a law that could have closed all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that advocates say would have likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
Signed into law by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal in June and set to take effect Sept. 1, the order would require abortion doctors to have the right to admit a patient at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge&#39;s order means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain that permission in the meantime.
&quot;The proposing party will be able to lawfully operate its business while obtaining a permit,&quot; Federal Judge John deGravelles said in the order.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month so the judge can issue a more permanent order regarding the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain permits.
&quot;Today&#39;s decision ensures Louisiana women will be safe from an insidious law designed to rob them of their health and rights,&quot; said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the five clinics seeking the block. of the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to doctors from the two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs and are also seeking that permission.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional by provision.
A federal judge on Friday blocked key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state.
Abortion advocates, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the requirement to have this license places medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.
Opponents of abortion countered that the measures were intended to protect women&#39;s health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would close clinics.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one doctor is licensed to perform abortions in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not penalize doctors who perform abortions while waiting for a license application to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a tribute video to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% were alive five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women over seven years of treatment.
Dr Jordan said the women&#39;s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other pre-existing diseases and socio-economic status affected the chances of survival.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women whose cancer was diagnosed at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan says late diagnosis and poor access to treatment may be factors.
&quot;The disease is best treated by gynecologists, who are usually based in larger cities,&quot; she said.
Despite improvements in telemedicine services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that strengthening transport services to allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes and programs to support people who are being treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival for women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mum Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers lament the decline in home ownership
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline, coupled with the extraordinary decline in home owners under 35, could see garden centers lose up to £10m a year when today&#39;s younger generation of consumers reaches the &#39;prime gardener age group&#39;.
According to the report, renters spend on average 55% of what people who own their own spend on their gardens.
He cites an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking space and the shrinking size of gardens as other factors threatening the industry, which makes an estimated five billion pounds a year.
The Greater London area, where the proportion of home owners has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, has the lowest spending per household on gardening products in Britain.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said subletting or lack of space did not mean people couldn&#39;t grow plants.
Guy Barter, senior horticultural adviser for the RHS, said: &quot;Potted plants are very popular with tenants - they can take the plants with them when they move.&quot;
The HTA report revealed that the &#39;golden age&#39; of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of home owners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year thanks to better weather that came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When an eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin rattled off atomic weapons at a meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, and basically let everyone know that their opinions are stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of a fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be controlled by both intense nationalism and that the inferiority complex can be transformed into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to pass differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the days of wars for supremacy over Europe were long gone, in the East, on the contrary, they think that they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis took power, and then there was an explosion of nationalism not unlike the situation in Russia today.
And then the completely identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the liquidation of inconvenient political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, it&#39;s probably quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of Russians, probably misses the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
It&#39;s probably the western politicians&#39; own fault, maybe they didn&#39;t pat Vladimir on the back enough, maybe they didn&#39;t invite him where he wanted to go and maybe they started underestimating him and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He put his house in order, pretended that he didn&#39;t even want to go anywhere and sharpened his knives at home.
Now he decided to take back the lost positions.
He starts slowly, he has time.
He is probably the leader for life, so where would he rush.
He trampled the Caucasians, now he&#39;s trampling the Ukrainians, then it&#39;s the Baltic dwarves&#39; turn.
They have been biting the Russian bear in the fur long enough.
This will surely be noticed even by China, which somehow jumps out a lot and is certainly making a big deal of the Far East.
And those Germans also annoy Vladimír, how well they are doing, and I put that on their ass in 1945.
How about making one new Novorossiy in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base, and there are a lot of our people there, and as they are oppressing them there, they already wanted to demolish the dacha of some of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they were in that Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he is so soft, he can be peeled like an onion and I will eat their whole EU.
That would be like jumping to great Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And we will use our namesakes who live on their territory as detonators.
There are enough Russians everywhere and when it is said that they are being oppressed there, they are simply being oppressed there and we will not leave it at that, we will protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, after all, what else is he born for.
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition on which the proud Ivan can dance the Cossack.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
Turkey&#39;s foreign minister has summoned the country&#39;s most senior US diplomat to explain a report about US and British spying activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d&#39;affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services, according to documents provided by a former US National Security Agency analyst.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major nations were monitoring each other.
An earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
The series Game of Thrones introduced other tricks of the fourth season
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming the fifth episodes of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth series were created.
The most obvious are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scene, when a group of soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants at the town hall in the municipality of Calvia to the Mallorcan public prosecutor&#39;s office on Friday.
The chief of police in Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested following allegations made by businessmen and bar owners in Magaluf&#39;s infamous party district.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into pre-trial detention after corruption charges were brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street where most of Magaluf&#39;s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and civil servants of the town hall in the municipality of Calvia to the prosecutor of the Mallorcan anti-corruption office.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police in connection with the corruption allegations and will be heard by a judge along with Navarro.
Spain&#39;s national daily ABC quoted disgruntled nightclub owners as saying favoritism by public officials is having a serious impact on their businesses.
&quot;It&#39;s no longer about making money, it&#39;s about survival,&quot; said one of the entrepreneurs in court.
Don&#39;t mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf has hit the headlines around the world after a video surfaced on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Island authorities have since been trying to keep tabs on drunks and rowdies among Magaful holiday partygoers by cutting back on the infamous boozy bar tours.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex incident took place, was forced to close for a year and pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000) along with the organizers of the Carnage bar tour.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with Brits, has also seen a number of drink-driving accidents, including a fad known as &quot;balconing&quot;, where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into a hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by rain and thunderstorms that affected flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRING has brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds taking a serious toll on Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain is expected to fall in the city until 9 o&#39;clock in the evening, and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last of the rain came along with several brief showers associated with thunderstorms and gusts of wind that started before 8:00 p.m. and brought nearly 4 mm of rain in about ten minutes.
After a few early doses of spring arrived after last week&#39;s winter, temperatures in the city dropped back to just 15.8C on Monday.
Stormy weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction at a short distance and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at the time were reaching speeds of around 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed the plane had to abort the second landing and finally touched down at about 8:40 p.m.
The plane&#39;s delay subsequently caused other flights to be delayed, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
Temperatures in Adelaide are forecast to reach a maximum of 16C on Tuesday with a chance of a shower or two.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters while rockets and mortars hit their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from the fighting.
The start of school has brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel scarred by the attacks, but signs of fighting are still evident.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, staff at a kindergarten hit by a rocket have removed the remains of shrapnel from the wall and are slowly waiting for the children to return.
&quot;We&#39;re a little scared, but otherwise we&#39;re looking forward to it,&quot; said Ronit Bartová, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
Many children from this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that &quot;it&#39;s a little weird&quot; going back to school all of a sudden.
&quot;We&#39;ve had some rough times and haven&#39;t left the house at all,&quot; she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the border with Gaza, to offer his support to the residents.
Until last week&#39;s ceasefire ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad stayed inside their homes or left their homes for safer areas further from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families still have not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the Gaza border that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study hard, adding: &quot;We will ensure your education and safety.&quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite peace deal last Tuesday.
While the ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas&#39; demand for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza&#39;s airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians have died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken shelter in a hundred UN schools that have been turned into makeshift shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and ongoing fighting, school officials delayed the start of the school year last week.
&quot;I hope they open the school soon so we can finish our education just like Jewish children and other children in the world,&quot; said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza&#39;s largest city.
Willow at the meeting: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafat is worried about the temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon today before Wednesday&#39;s warm-up match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
Out of the twenty-three-member squad, Spartan striker David Lafata is having problems, as he is suffering from a temperature.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David probably still has some of those problems.
But we want him to be here and to be fine as soon as possible,&quot; coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
&quot;If it will be two or three days, or if he will be fit tomorrow, that will be seen according to his health, which will be decided by our doctor,&quot; he added.
Other players are fine.
&quot;Of course someone has some pain, but it&#39;s not like they can&#39;t train or take part in the match against the USA on Wednesday,&quot; said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha as the last player.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I made my decision based on the fact that Lukáš is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I stand by it,&quot; Vrba said to Vách.
What about Šural?
We&#39;ll see what happens with Latata
It is not excluded that in case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend, for example, Josef Šural from Liberec shone with a great performance, scoring a hat trick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We&#39;ll see how David Lafata does.
In the event that he is not able to be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot dominate one of the players who impressed in the Czech league,&quot; Vrba pointed out.
This afternoon, the national team will have training in Strahov, and on Tuesday, a classic pre-match training before the duel with the USA in Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match against the Americans is played on Wednesday from 8:15 p.m., and the national team will aim for its first victory under Vrba.
In the previous three preliminary matches, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9 from 20:45.
He goes to Italy on foot in the Netherlands
Vrba is happy that he has more time for training, unlike previous meetings.
It&#39;s an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we didn&#39;t have that much time for, for example.
Now we will only be able to concentrate on preparing as best as possible for the Netherlands,&quot; Vrba praised himself.
Before the match in Prague, the Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday, and the duel will be personally watched by the former temporary national team coach Josef Pešice.
He will give us the information that is from the match.
But it won&#39;t just be about him, we&#39;ll have the match filmed and we&#39;ll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we&#39;ll see what changes there will be,&quot; said Vrba to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to closely watched statistics, apartment prices rose the most in the last seven years in the winter.
Housing prices rose 1.1% in August, according to Data CoreLogic Hedonic&#39;s Australian capital home value index, the agency said on Monday.
The increase brought the total increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth climbed to 10.9%, more than doubling in the one year to August 2013, but the gain was not evenly spread across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne were leading the market.
Figures from RP Data show Sydney apartment prices rose 16.1% last year, while Melbourne prices rose 11.7%.
The other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with price increases averaging between five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was hurt by state-mandated spending cuts and saw prices rise by just 1.4% over the year.
Lawless said that with spring now underway, the number of properties for sale would increase in the coming months, which would be a &quot;real test&quot; for the market.
&quot;Given the continued high rate of auction sales, the generally high speed of sales and low interest rates, it is likely that housing values will increase further over the next three months,&quot; he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said &quot;I love you&quot; to me
Henry was born in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958, one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants.
They had a cooler relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19 and worked in a factory.
Henry auditions for a comedy, Rudy&#39;s Rare Records, based in part on an imaginary interview with his father, which is part of a Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is upbeat.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant memories from his childhood.
After his mother&#39;s death, Henry underwent &quot;thorough&quot; therapy and now reflects on his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: “Stop that noise.
Leave the sister alone.
Run away!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child they were grown up - would go to the bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never talked to him like that.
For most of my life he was the serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently, Henry visited a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father&#39;s time, he got a glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
There&#39;s a little more light today, but it&#39;s still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth with flames erupting and lots of smoke and soot.
Dad would always get in the tub and just lay there, then you could hear him slowly start singing to himself as he washed the foundry off of him.
As I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to support his family, and I began to respect him more.
Even so, Henry lived his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn&#39;t hug anyone, didn&#39;t say &quot;I love you.&quot;
It wasn&#39;t until mom was sick and dying that we started saying &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you.&quot;
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn French, has allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying &quot;I love you&quot; already?
Don&#39;t hug me all the time!
Dad, I&#39;m 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn&#39;t we be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom
He is still good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is nice.
Why shouldn&#39;t Dawn and I be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom.
Henry&#39;s own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor said to me, &quot;You have to make a radical change.&quot;
So I started going to a big fitness center and also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots alone.
The change in direction of Henry&#39;s career is perhaps reflected in his sleek, close-cropped beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in theatre.
It was followed by A Comedy of Errors and Fences by August Wilson.
It&#39;s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 working in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him for the New Faces talent show.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: &quot;For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television.&quot;
He was learning as he went.
In addition to having to be noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to come up with jokes that worked, to be a star and to be on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to a stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed up as blacks, Henry ended up performing his comedy in it for five years.
My family was already upset about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don&#39;t regret it.
Although it was a strange and awkward position, I was working on big stages and learning how to work the crowd.
What was &quot;an award-winning staple of British television for years&quot; was also &quot;a grotesque parody of black people.&quot;
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, presenting characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was best known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade was filled with commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles, but after his LennyHenry.tv series aired on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: &quot;So what are you going to do now, Lena, it looks a bit like you&#39;re stuck on one place, or you&#39;re going a little off track.&#39;
Next up was a Radio 4 documentary called What&#39;s So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was seriously allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn&#39;t really learn it in school and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of that.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, &quot;You should try it.&quot;
Don&#39;t jump into this if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.
Try a few words and you&#39;ll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited twenty lines from Othello&#39;s final speech for the documentary and was already on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
&quot;It&#39;s about it. It&#39;s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, learn something about it.
So the rehearsal was tough and I read the play for months and months beforehand.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were expecting trouble, which didn&#39;t happen.
He soon began acting in the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre. I could not believe it.
At one point I thought, &quot;You&#39;ve changed.&quot;
There was a technical glitch and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for seizing the audience.
&quot;A voice in my head said, &#39;Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.&#39;&quot;
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would go ahead once the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, &quot;Um, thank God.&quot;
It&#39;s not my responsibility.
Someone else can sort it out for me.
&quot;You&#39;re acting, so stay the part.&quot;
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it&#39;s like a sign from God saying, &quot;You should do this.&quot;
Of course he says it in a LOUD voice.
So I&#39;m sticking with it.
I really like it.
I&#39;m happy in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has the brain of a comedian - all the time he interrupts our conversation with humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of an impersonator.
I decided not to do stand-up because getting satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I&#39;d say.
When you keep looking for something, you can reach a dead end.
Sometimes I do Live at the Apollo when I want to, but I don&#39;t enjoy it like I used to.
I asked if he would ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director helping to outline the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don&#39;t think I ever want to give that up.
So your new incarnation?
I think yes.
I enjoy acting.
It is fun.
You keep telling stories which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants in an attempt to remove non-existent employees from the government&#39;s payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving their pay.
The government believes thousands of people are being paid even after leaving the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to curb corruption in the civil service.
An audit carried out this year showed the state was losing at least $1m (£700,000) a month in non-existent pay and other abuses of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after an employee dies or leaves the civil service, the BBC&#39;s Wanyama Chebusiri reported from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must report to identification centers within the next two weeks where their details will be biometrically recorded, a government statement said.
He goes on to say that anyone who fails to show up without sufficient excuse will be dropped from the payroll.
“By identifying the real employees of the public service, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for &#39;conspiracy&#39; against the government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of &quot;conspiracy against the government&quot;.
The police office has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were implicated in a corruption investigation in December that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (prime minister at the time) described their actions as part of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen&#39;s campaign against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened after summer vacation on Monday (September 1).
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools have reopened, but that he is determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held the traditional September 1st ceremony.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at the school in Slavyansk that Yatsenyuk&#39;s daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that the children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for tough times
He carries with him clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner conclave of the Conservative Party.
She herself has experience from the front lines.
She started her career at consultancy Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
She was managing director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned from the post when a younger colleague filled the top job at Pearson&#39;s parent company.
Her severance package is said to have been close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, a former BP director, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became a Cabinet Office adviser.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the headmaster&#39;s job as a chalice of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inwards to the top echelons of the BBC&#39;s own management hierarchy, but also outwards to the voice of the public in times of turmoil when things aren&#39;t working.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But which director would take the risk of coming into a company as complex as a Chinese dynasty, breaking it up, and thus losing his job.
It&#39;s a tough challenge.
If it weren&#39;t so difficult, many people would like to see the BBC reduced - its power, its finances - and its status revised.
As competition widens and new technology challenges old certainties, imminent license fee negotiations carry major risks for the BBC.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is surely the biggest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims its output reaches 96% of households and costs just 40p a day each.
Moreover, the BBC&#39;s popularity is clearly on the rise: at 53% of supporters, up from 31% ten years ago.
The patterns of using BBC services have changed: Today I get newspaper headlines on my mobile phone and catch up on iPlayer for programs I missed.
But the BBC continues to be a much-loved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he did not approve the offensive tweet
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry&#39;s official Twitter account, posted Sunday, included an offensive image of the Democratic attorney general who initiated criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry&#39;s account, distancing himself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized left my account.
&quot;I disagree with the tweet and have taken it down,&quot; he said in another post.
Perry&#39;s aides did not immediately return messages with questions.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry&#39;s official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for managing it.
A previous tweet posted an unflattering, humorous image of Travis County State&#39;s Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry denied disbursements to her office, which landed Perry, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, before an Austin grand jury this month.
The tweet&#39;s caption read, &quot;I don&#39;t always drive with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit...but when I do, I&#39;m suing Governor Perry for holding me accountable.&quot;
I&#39;m the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg&#39;s office.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge, was in charge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His skilled legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because using the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended $7.5 million in payments from the state&#39;s public interest defense fund, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint by a left-leaning group of civic activists.
Perry&#39;s official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in his party&#39;s caucus in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might quit by tweeting a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying: &quot;Here I am South Carolina!&#39;
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to &quot;normal&quot;
One of London&#39;s most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has &quot;returned&quot; to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital has been in high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of high-end developer Berkeley, said on Monday: &quot;Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions from its high point in 2013,&quot; adding that this provides a &quot;stable environment in which to operate.&quot;
London&#39;s housing market fared well during the downturn as overseas buyers flooded into the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5% in the last year alone, far outstripping the 6.7% average for England and Wales as a whole, according to Land Registry data.
Average sale prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by around a fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening pound has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some have also been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible &#39;residential tax&#39; by politicians ahead of next May&#39;s general election.
London estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April&#39;s review of the mortgage market, which introduced tighter lending rules, would also slow the pace of market growth in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in the number of mortgage approvals for the month of July, suggesting the housing market is easing.
Hamptons International, another estate agency, cut its 2015 London property price growth forecast to 3% on the basis that house prices had already started to fall.
Meanwhile, transaction volumes in London&#39;s most expensive boroughs such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have fallen by a quarter each year, according to estate agency WA Ellis.
Still, demand for housing in the capital has been a boon for Berkeley, boosting cash for forward sales to more than £2.2bn.
Pidgley added: &quot;Demand for the right, good-looking home in a good location has remained consistent and forward sales have been sustained as a result.&quot;
In June, the firm reported that it had sold 3,742 properties between the start of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the height of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40% to £380m, revenues up 18% to £1.6bn.
Speaking ahead of the company&#39;s annual meeting on Monday, Pidgley said Berkeley&#39;s annual revenue is forecast to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that annual pre-tax profit will be £450m.
Berkeley shares closed at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
A hacker published photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot;list&quot; of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesperson for the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; star confirmed that Lawrence&#39;s photos are genuine and slammed the hacker for &quot;a clear violation of privacy.&quot;
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker allegedly obtained the photos, which were originally posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, thanks to a loophole in Apple&#39;s iCloud internet storage system. According to BuzzFeed, the alleged list of hacked victims&#39; photos includes the names of dozens of stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It&#39;s unclear how many of the photos are authentic, but &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; star Winstead also took to Twitter to criticize the act.
&quot;I hope those of you looking at the photos my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our own home are happy with yourselves,&quot; Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, known for the Nickolodeon cable TV series &quot;iCarly&quot; and &quot;Victorious,&quot; denied that the photos were genuine. She shared on Twitter: &quot;These alleged nude photos of me are FAKE, people.&quot;
Better to cut it in the bud. *pun intended*.
Buzzfeed reported Sunday night that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary preview from Howard Jacobson&#39;s acclaimed new novel about love and the letter &quot;J&quot;
They dissolved, that&#39;s the best way to describe it, gradually disintegrating like a cardboard box someone left out in the rain.
Only from time to time a woman told him that he was too serious, complex, impetuous, isolated and perhaps a little hot-tempered.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it irritably.
He could sting, like a hedgehog, yes.
The latest victim of this ability of his was a budding love affair that promised more than usual to relieve his lonely boredom and perhaps even provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a frail beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fluttering heart from a North Island village even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an elderly companion, whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who had inherited property in a damp but beautiful valley called, fittingly, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the bathtubs, slugs had made their ugly signatures on the windows as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown and the weeds looked like huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children&#39;s stories, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author Profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel &#39;J&#39; is shortlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on deck chairs in the long grass and holding hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absentmindedly tuning in to the public station that supplied the region with comforting music and soothing messages, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song the long-forgotten black comedian his father liked to listen to with the blinds drawn.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren&#39;t banned - nothing really was banned - they just weren&#39;t played.
They helped them get into desuetudo, just like the word desuetudo itself.
Popular taste did what regulations and outlaws could never do, and just as people choose poor-man-turned-rich memoirs, cookbooks, and romance novels in books, so in music they choose ballads.
Kavern got carried away and started playing an imaginary piano, serenading Aillina&#39;s big feet in a rough, comical voice.
Ailinn didn&#39;t understand.
&quot;That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller,&quot; he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That&#39;s what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was still little.
His father told him that he had played the game with his father as well.
If you didn&#39;t put two fingers in front of your mouth at a word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn&#39;t very funny then, and it&#39;s not funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard one.
They didn&#39;t play jazz either, even if it wasn&#39;t outlawed outright.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room for one &quot;if&quot; in life.
When the tune started playing, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got on people&#39;s nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in song.
Although he hadn&#39;t heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father&#39;s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn&#39;t have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she couldn&#39;t remember a time when popular singers weren&#39;t black.
Also without laws or coercion.
A permissive society is one in which every part of it gratefully - with the gratitude of those fortunately spared - agrees to the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent, with a temperament and constitution suited to entertainment and athletics, sang and ran.
Hailing from the Indian subcontinent, seemingly gifted with electronics by nature, they have taken it upon themselves to ensure that no family is without a working phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed washed dishes.
Those from the Gulf and Levant states whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly while WHAT HAPPENED was happening - they were afraid of being accused of putting them in the fire, in fact, they were afraid that the fire would consume them next is - they opened restaurants where they sold labneh and smoked hookahs, they didn&#39;t draw attention to themselves and inactivity slowly ate them up.
To each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn had a hard time understanding how the profane words Kavern had just sung to her could be made into music.
Music was an expression of love.
&quot;They&#39;re not really dirty,&quot; Kevern said.
Maybe only for people with very big feet.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn&#39;t understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers in his mouth again in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
&quot;He thought she was funny,&quot; he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern&#39;s view.
In all the wide world there was nothing to see but a mess of her raven hair.
He didn&#39;t want to see anything else.
&quot;When you think,&quot; she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn&#39;t explain why you sing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not quite the feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
do i hate
It is not true.
It&#39;s just a stupid song.
He could have told her &quot;I love you&quot; but it was too soon.
&quot;Your thick ankles are turning me on,&quot; he tried.
I&#39;m a little picky.
That didn&#39;t work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the charm necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was being cruel on purpose.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons flushed and stood up from the lounger, dropping the radio and spilling the half-finished wine.
Elderberry wine, so drinking wasn&#39;t to blame.
She seemed to be shaking in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
“I&#39;m perversely attracted to you being a jerk,” she said…
Except I&#39;m not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and the fear in her eyes the moment she confronted him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She hadn&#39;t talked to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she&#39;d grown up, but he had no doubt that it was basically the same there as it was here.
The same wide and icy ocean broke about them.
The same deranged men, after WHAT HAPPENED, even more intemperate and morose than their forefathers, the bootleggers and scoundrels, wandered angrily from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who dared refuse them or laugh at them.
Jerk?
If she&#39;s not careful, they&#39;ll show her their fists!
Pet her first - pet her became the most common term for erotic teasing between a man and a woman: the antidote to the bland love ballads that the radio spewed - first pet her, then kill her.
Too much sophistication in Kevern&#39;s opinion, as cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons non-verbally motioned for him to leave.
He got up from the couch like an old man.
She felt annoyed herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn&#39;t the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from an upstairs window - a man caught up in what he had caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart sank for him and all men in general regardless of the fact that a few of them had beaten her.
The man turned away from her, shoulders slumped, ashamed, defeated, all combativeness gone - why did she feel like she knew this look so well, even though she couldn&#39;t remember a single moment until today that she&#39;d ever seen it again?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked down at her feet.
Some twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic thirty-two-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, a non-statutory Public Mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where it was most expected to be reduced or stopped. if enough money and energy were expended to remove it.
&quot;Much has been done and much remains to be done,&quot; she wrote, &quot;to calm the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in remote, hard-to-reach parts of the country, where despite the tips of church towers rising above the hedges have historically rarely seen a touch of human kindness.&#39;
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the steeple, the lower the impulses.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour tales of woe, and profess a firm belief in the value of marriage and family life, but not only does the old brutality cling as stubbornly in rural areas as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace , roads and even on sports fields, a new and offensive intolerance is emerging.
&quot;Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery,&quot; her superior said.
I would suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
&quot;I feel like I don&#39;t have to answer that,&quot; Esme Nussbaum said.
are you a lesbian
Esme again asserted her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
More silence.
&quot;I&#39;m not asking,&quot; Rabinowitz said finally, &quot;because I have something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We have no prejudices in this workplace.
We serve an open-minded society.
But a certain kind of over-sensitivity, which is perfectly acceptable and commendable in itself, can sometimes distort judgment in the way you have demonstrated.
Obviously you yourself are prejudiced against the church - the things you call &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;brutal&quot; could also be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Always solving WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, prepares the earth with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Flashing pink on the light board behind his head was the recommendation Ofnow had been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, come to an agreement, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I completely understand your reservations,” Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she was sure her superior had finished, “and I&#39;m not saying the wound hasn&#39;t healed the way we pretend it has.
My main concern is that if we are not warned ahead of time, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED IF THIS HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together.
This was supposed to mean infinite patience.
“You are going too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about them venting their &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;distrust&quot; on &quot;others.&quot;
I shouldn&#39;t have to remind someone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we don&#39;t talk about &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;
There was no &quot;us&quot; and there was no &quot;them.&quot;
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
“During which, if we&#39;re being honest with ourselves,” Esme plucked up her courage, “none of us are blameless.
I don&#39;t blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add to this - we agree on this.
And just as there is no blame to lay on anyone, there are no things to correct, even if correction were appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past for but to learn from it -
The past exists to be forgotten.
If I can add anything to that -
Luther Rabinowitz spread his fingertips.
&quot;I will take your message into consideration,&quot; he said, dismissing her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk in a manner described by passers-by as &quot;brutal and furious.&quot;
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says it is not planning a coup - the prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officers in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government and say they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the military has surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After claiming death threats, the prime minister left for neighboring South Africa with his family.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not actually a coup but the army&#39;s response to the threat of &quot;political fanatics&quot; who the police were trying to arm.
&quot;This morning the Defense Command of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were several groups within the police who were planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to wreak havoc in the country,&quot; he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions appeared to be an attempt to overthrow the government.
&quot;Although no one claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of Lesotho&#39;s defense forces appear to bear the hallmarks of a coup d&#39;état,&quot; he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was calm.
During Thabana&#39;s absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be in charge of the government.
Thabane said he believed he was being targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Lesotho has been under tension since June when Thabane suspended parliament due to internal disputes.
He stated that despite claims to the contrary, his actions do not undermine the government.
Production in the eurozone is at a thirteen-month low
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to a thirteen-month low in August, according to a closely watched survey.
The final Eurozone purchasing managers&#39; index (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders fell and factories were hurt by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday&#39;s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to that undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
&quot;While at least some growth is better than no growth, the dampening effect that a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty is having on manufacturers is increasingly visible,&quot; said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia&#39;s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an eleven-month low of 51.4.
In the zone&#39;s second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, while Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the growth drivers in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very reassuring,” said Dobson.
The industry slowdown is likely to add fuel to the fire of analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: &quot;The best thing to say about the manufacturing PMI for August is that it shows the sector is still growing.&quot;
He added: Life is very difficult for Eurozone manufacturers at the moment as rising geopolitical tensions - mainly between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably hit business - most notably consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially expensive ones.
He said it appeared &quot;even more likely&quot; that the ECB would eventually have to do some form of quantitative easing, &quot;although we expect it to be limited.&quot;
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years after the horrors of the occupied school, children still suffer
Ten years ago, Chechen radicals held a thousand people hostage at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during the three-day ordeal that shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrific occupation of a school in Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, last night the surviving heroes warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, it seemed like the deepest depths of hell.
Resistance over the tragedy brought East and West together, leading to action and a future in this cataclysmic calamity.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who defied adversity, even if the memory of the terror caused by the terrorists will live on in them.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is already over.
A girl trying to climb back into the destroyed school gymnasium
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov trying to crawl back into a bombed-out school gymnasium in only her underwear after a bomb exploded inside.
Confused, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, now in her forties.
Both were feared dead, but in fact they survived.
&quot;A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had made a full recovery but said yesterday: “Three months ago the pain came back.
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to have another operation.
There were pieces of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors have helped her.
&quot;This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly hasn&#39;t destroyed it,&quot; she said resolutely.
&quot;It just happened to me and it can&#39;t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzhera Gapova was killed there.
As children, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don&#39;t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I will think about family later.
She says she hasn&#39;t forgotten the captivity, but the memories fade a little with each passing year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at the photo of me climbing through the school window on the Internet, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped a hail of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia children start school at the age of seven) and he survived the three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said: &quot;My mum told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her hand.&quot;
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She told him, &quot;Run.&quot;
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, he grabbed the child&#39;s hand and they ran away in a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: &quot;Damir told me his mother is dead.&quot;
He says, &quot;I couldn&#39;t save her.&quot;
In reality, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with an injured leg, instead thinking her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried with happiness.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World) where he was announced as the winner of Bernardo&#39;s Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
&quot;The horror comes back every day but I wish I could stop thinking about it,&quot; he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But today I can play computer games that involve shooting and I have no problem with it.
“I&#39;m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I&#39;m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who didn&#39;t get out.
We never say that they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in the toy shop and how I drove in a convertible.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where they are suffering the same way he and his friends suffered because of the war.
The horror returns every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
&quot;I feel very sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror,&quot; says Damir, who took part in a volunteer activity at the monastery last week.
I really want to help.
I want to work for the police one day and hope to be accepted into the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “They killed 37 children from our neighbourhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children screaming and running around here, and the silence lasted for several months.
He vividly remembers the trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her in person that even though it&#39;s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember how you played with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn&#39;t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think many children have been and will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they&#39;re bored or while they&#39;re doing something else.
I know what those people are going through, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it&#39;s so sad.
Damir grew up to be a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not desire revenge, he is not interested in this at all.
I know he doesn&#39;t like to remember it, but he&#39;s very close to six of his classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was smaller he had problems with this - I remember him sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He wasn&#39;t sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his guns or other toy weapons. Damir is 17 today, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was sure he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy had no chance of surviving this hell.
“I remember screaming &#39;Damire, run, run!&#39;, but I was convinced he didn&#39;t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
Fear was etched into his bloodied face as he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot dead his classmates.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her older son Vladimir to university.
&quot;I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, leaving my little boy there alone for three days,&quot; she recalled.
Not quite alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it gets harder and harder to think about and talk about.
Not a single day goes by that we don&#39;t remember that tragedy.
It doesn&#39;t feel like it happened a long time ago, it feels like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Memories keep coming back: Grigori&#39;s photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember how Grigori was really looking forward to school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of the weeping Grigori in San Marino.
Grigorij doesn&#39;t like to look at that photo and we have it hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of that picture, people all over the world know the pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says: &quot;It is important that this does not happen again.
&quot;I doubt we&#39;ll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they are investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
Something very bad is waiting for this world.
&quot;I don&#39;t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is this possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes decades for us to forget at least a little.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
I had nightmares about the attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
Then when I went back to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates that they killed.
That&#39;s why when September 1st approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It&#39;s hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don&#39;t feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won&#39;t forget it, but I don&#39;t regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at Vladikavkaz University.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
At first I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn&#39;t because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won&#39;t work.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
Miracle: Gregoriy Farniyev was held at the feet of the murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
As the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It&#39;s a real miracle that he survived.
&quot;It feels like yesterday,&quot; said Gregorij, who wanted to become an FBI agent but was unable to because of injuries he sustained during the attack.
It&#39;s still with me, it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve put behind me.
Now I&#39;m older and they say that children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that&#39;s not true.
&quot;In 2006, I went to a psychologist and then I got a little better, but I can&#39;t forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after that - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please don&#39;t ask me to show you where I sit in that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregorij Farniev today, on a laptop with a photo of himself taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don&#39;t like to think or talk about it and they never ask me about school.
In terms of physical health, I am fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I injured, but I&#39;m walking normally now.
But even so, due to health reasons, I could not enter and study at the FBS academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents including medical reports and they replied that it was not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I entered veterinary school.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to heal all animals from &quot;cats to cows&quot;.
He said: “I know I will never explain this to my children.
It&#39;s not something children should know about and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
It&#39;s inside and getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will attend memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigori won&#39;t go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn&#39;t help him.
I am so thankful to God that he gave me back. Here in Beslan, the tracks are everywhere.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he still carries the horror.
It&#39;s hard to accept when something so horribly unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he can&#39;t do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several operations, he can walk but cannot exercise.
I would say that 50% of the fear has already been overcome, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and that is the greatest gift god could have given me, but the loss of those killed hurts.
I know families in which more children were born, but also widows who never remarried.
It&#39;s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don&#39;t want to.
I&#39;ll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I observe what is happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is coming to our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past we were one friendly country, so how did we get to the point where we are fighting each other now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could pick up all those rebels and throw them away - as far as we can go.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who was carried to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by Russian special commandos (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no recollection of the tragedy
In 2004, the world gasped when a Russian policeman carried little Alyona in her arms from captivity in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar captive in the school gymnasium.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon&#39;s mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and with his new wife Svetlana they have a little girl whom they named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say Alyona, now ten, has no recollection of the attack and has grown up to be a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend stated that &quot;it&#39;s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.&quot;
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary brings to mind.
You can understand why.
Man accused of hitting girl at crossing sign in Fife village
A 78-year-old man is on trial for hitting a three-year-old girl at a crossing sign in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a crossing in Pittenween, East Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart failed to drive his Audi Q3 with due care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at Dundee Crown Court.
Judge Charles Macnair set a trial date for January.
4 tips to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or filming underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact camera such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all under $350.
It doesn&#39;t matter what equipment you use, but there are a few rules for getting the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you will be taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scene or video mode that optimizes exposure for dark underwater environments.
And before you go, find out how deep you can dive with your gear.
Some cameras are only rated up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our buying guide and reviews of regular and waterproof digital cameras.
Always take several pictures - many of them will not turn out.
Compact cameras have an LCD to help you compose photos, but outdoor cameras don&#39;t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take multiple shots.
If your camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of shots with slightly different exposure variance, take advantage of that.
Stay close to the surface.
With deeper immersion, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Get close to the subject being photographed.
This is great advice if you&#39;re shooting on land, but it&#39;s even more important underwater due to the dimmer light.
This is especially important if you shoot with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle lens, which means that you have to get closer to your subjects if you want to fill the photo frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose force of personality could make a difference even in an organization as huge as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he has dedicated his career to relieving patients of the pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the effects of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors are focused on diagnoses and diseases, the vast majority of patients being treated are interested in something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
&quot;I don&#39;t feel comfortable in my own skin,&quot; he wrote in May of that year.
I felt out of energy.
Struggling with flu symptoms, he found himself impatient and resentful of his wife, Juliet.
He noted, &quot;I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.&quot;
When Juliet left for a week on business, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague took a chest x-ray.
He had been skiing in the French Alps once two weeks earlier.
X-ray results came in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
Most cancers are difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material that was once called a &quot;miracle&quot; but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma was not difficult to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into effect.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation layers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
A toxin used in industry in another era hardly seems a cause for concern today.
But such complacency is out of place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
The 2,500 deaths per year from this disease are twice the number of car accident victims.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Great Britain
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that mesothelioma usually takes several decades to develop.
The scourge of mesothelioma does not only affect veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in, and the stores we shop in.
Thus, mesothelioma does not respect social class, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools are no shelter.
Even Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where they are supposed to treat us are repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn&#39;t even install insulation.
He was trying to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
&quot;It is possible that much of the asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy&#39;s Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,&quot; he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was only partially able to answer.
&quot;Of the four doctors who practiced at Guy&#39;s Hospital and subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years,&quot; he noted in a 2010 letter, &quot;I am the only one still alive.&quot;
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17 of this year.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson&#39;s question: &quot;How many of us will get the same disease?&quot;
According to the UK&#39;s leading mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Peto, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, around 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory look at the files from the archives of the courts, which are often turned to by sufferers seeking settlement, shows just how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma has become.
For example, this June Marks &amp; Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, overseeing the clothing section of two stores - one of which was the company&#39;s flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was just 18 when she started working for M&amp;S.
Today she has two children who are in their twenties.
“Before this happened,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
It never occurred to me in my wildest dreams that he could have anything to do with me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
It got its name due to its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Most commonly found in buildings today is chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
Not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still consider it a &quot;major health risk&quot; that can cause death.
Brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world&#39;s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say &quot;there is compelling but circumstantial evidence that it was a major cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].&quot;
A Marsk &amp; Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto&#39;s work shows that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that &quot;a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.&quot;
Much of this exposure is due to the &quot;normal use and weathering&quot; of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the center of government may have no idea they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard released a report that found service elevators and ductwork behind the parliamentary committee rooms contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as innocuous as &quot;a strong draft.&quot;
Ministers are often accused of looking out for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Parliamentary Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a &quot;clear medical certificate&quot;, it is now estimated that £1 million and several years of work will be needed to thoroughly inspect Parliament, upgrade the electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 election, MPs will sit in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Center rather than on the Green Benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that &quot;the presence of asbestos is non-compliant with several regulations.&quot;
There is no telling if this discrepancy will cost lives.
All they can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to pinpoint when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) also suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case I can&#39;t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009 when something like a chill came over him.
He was 45, it was evening and he was in the middle of surgery.
I suddenly shook.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn&#39;t drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused doctors took an X-ray of his chest and inserted a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
Still, they didn&#39;t make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
But his symptoms returned from time to time, often after he exercised and became short of breath.
In 2011, one of Abbott&#39;s patients came into the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott made no connection with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had come into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott&#39;s condition worsened again and his doctor reviewed his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling sick, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the space between the lining of his chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I&#39;m an optimist.
I tend not to buy much,&quot; he says.
To be honest, I wasn&#39;t too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year: &quot;They told me it was mesothelioma.&quot;
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with nurses from the charity Macmillan and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
&quot;It turned out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the ductwork,&quot; he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to develop the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have high-risk occupations.
The most dangerous pipes, thermally insulated with asbestos, were located in the basement of hospitals, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, members of staff who walked between buildings in the basement corridors (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) most certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, for several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
The students built their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats
And it&#39;s not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos since school.
Somewhere, in countless chemistry classes, students set up a Bunsen burner on an asbestos pad.
Websites dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools have been created.
Innocuous things like floor tiles or the roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
&quot;This is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,&quot; notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy&#39;s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could recall was in the 1970s when she was demolishing a garden shed.
So be careful how you tear down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
&quot;It takes a while to get the hang of it,&quot; says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but found I couldn&#39;t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won&#39;t live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to make sense of it all,” he says.
&quot;I asked my doctor, &#39;How much time do I have left?&#39;
I was told twelve months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I won&#39;t live to see another Christmas.
That&#39;s it.&quot;
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can lodge in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutation.
&quot;The needle-shaped fibers of inhaled asbestos are the problem,&quot; explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy&#39;s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, paradoxically, is a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knows Lawson and has treated other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos while working at the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and “breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
It is invasive in nature from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the common treatment options used for other types of cancer do not work as well.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
&quot;You can&#39;t remove the pleura,&quot; he says.
You can&#39;t get a scalpel around her.
The cancer &quot;doesn&#39;t respond very well to chemotherapy,&quot; which, while it &quot;does have some effect,&quot; doesn&#39;t cure it.
“Occasionally there is someone who survives lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But eventually they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould dies 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became a one-on-one support and counselor for similarly affected people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: &quot;Hello, you have called the cancer headquarters.&quot;
&quot;He was very positive,&quot; says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the start, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months and likely only add a month to his life.
&quot;I was desperate,&quot; he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson &quot;was able to show things in a more optimistic light.&quot;
After seeing several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
&quot;I had the advantage that I didn&#39;t have to wait for them to send me to him, I just called and they checked me out,&quot; admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a requisition and be approved for reimbursement.
In order to get the best treatment available, money is a key issue for mesothelioma patients.
But when various treatments inevitably fail, many patients face additional financial worries - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that is why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
&quot;Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,&quot; says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it can pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy&#39;s Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan it was not a &quot;full settlement&quot; because Lawson could not conclusively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
However, following an investigation into the case, a spokesman for Guy&#39;s Hospital confirmed that &quot;asbestos in the basement in question was removed in the 1990s.&quot;
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Attributing deadly asbestos exposure to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proven to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed hands or gone bankrupt.
Insurance records have been lost.
And those now defending themselves against the charges have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was passed this year, making it easier for mesothelioma patients to seek compensation, even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, paid by insurance companies, for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as compensation - around £120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks £350m is &quot;good work&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s a deal written by insurance companies for insurance companies,&quot; he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have had to pay if time hadn&#39;t intervened and people with mesothelioma had been able to track down former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Labor and Social Affairs Minister, admitted the law &quot;had loopholes.&quot;
But both Penning and Morgan concede that with seven deaths each year, swift action was necessary.
&quot;People are suffering too much and they need help now,&quot; Penning said during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill last December.
Graham Abbott was under the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
It made Abbott stronger.
&quot;Obviously, that&#39;s not the most important thing,&quot; says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Checkups showed no signs of disease.
I went for another checkup in March [2014].
I had several spots [of cancer] scattered throughout my chest.
My fiftieth birthday was just around the corner.
It is not life threatening.
It takes him.
Abbott again underwent six rounds of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of cancer in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or showing my wife how the boiler alarm works.
When you hear bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
As a father to Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it&#39;s not always easy.
&quot;It&#39;s hard for parents,&quot; she says.
It&#39;s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After my diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn&#39;t say much.
All cancer patients must face such conversations.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not lightened with hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
Illness brings with it (and eventually brought with it Stephen Jay Gould) a joyless certainty.

China refuses to give Hong Kong power to choose leadership - protesters vow revenge
China&#39;s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing talk of democratic reform.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong&#39;s business district, as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People&#39;s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
&quot;We&#39;re not surprised, but we&#39;re outraged,&quot; said Legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China&#39;s decision, National People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee Deputy Secretary-General Li Fei said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong&#39;s leadership election would cause &quot;chaos&quot;.
Since 1997, when Britain returned the administration of Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that starting in 2017 residents will be able to vote for the executive.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday&#39;s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are firmly in control of the committee&#39;s nomination process, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who &quot;love the country and Hong Kong&quot; will be eligible.
The decision came after a summer that saw some of Hong Kong&#39;s biggest and most watched protests in years.
Most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have been led by the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong&#39;s government headquarters.
At the rally, organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement &quot;considered occupying the Central only as a last resort in the event that all options for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other option.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Headquarters is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing&#39;s announcement for days and on Sunday stepped up security at the government headquarters, deploying police officers and barricades.
The incitement to unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying their demonstrations threaten commerce - Hong Kong&#39;s lifeboat.
&quot;The protest they&#39;re talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,&quot; says politician Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We do not want fears to spread that Hong Kong is spiraling out of control.
Such a perception could hurt investments.
Chinese state media have also come out with reports in recent days that paint pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents directed by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong&#39;s electorate.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region&#39;s history.
Pre-election campaign?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
Approximately 1,600 amateur athletes play minor football in the regional town of Vysočiny.
And their highest competition is now called the Together for Jihlava league.
It was named after a movement that is going to the October municipal elections.
In addition, Jan Mráka, the head of the small soccer team in Jihlava, is number ten on his list of candidates.
&quot;There was a general meeting where there was no problem with that,&quot; said Mráka.
The lawyers of the Jihlava town hall have already dealt with the situation surrounding the first league of minor football and recommended changing the system of distributing subsidies.
Last year, according to the city&#39;s website, the small football club received around a million crowns.
Even this year, the amount is in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of small kicking is not contrary to the law or the directives of the municipality.
However, the situation is an incentive for the office to adjust the rules for allocating grants and subsidies,&quot; said municipal spokesman Radek Tulis.
It probably won&#39;t work to draw subsidies from the city and at the same time express as a small kick support in the elections to one political party.
The Vysočin &quot;big&quot; football has not yet received a similar request from politicians.
That perhaps the ČSSD regional champion, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1 would be created.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn&#39;t be for it.
On the contrary, I would be happy if corporate sponsors turned to us,&quot; commented the chairman of the regional football association, Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of small football will not let other parties and movements into the name of the league
According to the players of small football, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own area with six pitches, changing rooms and sanitary facilities.
&quot;For example, the Na Stoupách playground is not ours, we are renting it,&quot; pointed out Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be Český mlýn.
But there, for example, in my opinion, a pointless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava, will be built,&quot; pointed out Mráka.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), responded that the small football team uses artificial grass pitches in Rošického and Na Stoupách streets, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports fields at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that for a small soccer team, huge progress has been made in recent years,&quot; added Vymazal.
According to Jan Mráka, other political parties will not appear in the names of the leagues.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us in the partnership, we don&#39;t put the other one in,&quot; he explained.
&quot;Political movement in the name of the league, I consider it to be at least an unfortunate step,&quot; said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall&#39;s sports committee.
&quot;But let the voters evaluate whether or not Mr. Mráka is using the Malá kopaná Jihlava association and city subsidies for political purposes,&quot; he added.
An American tradition permeates university life - freshmen can fly a jet plane
We are delighted to be able to answer the demand by launching Britain&#39;s first luxury travel service for students.
In order to make the best possible impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that there is a security side to the service.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to lug their belongings across the country in a dangerously loaded car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, students will arrive at university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that as the services had only just launched, they did not have any bookings yet, but added: &quot;Students will start booking within the next few weeks.&quot;
The company also said that although students pay annual tuition fees of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today&#39;s students are different in terms of expectations and desires - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve this.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Higher Education Union, commented: “For most students, a project like this is out of reach.
Many students starting university this month have to deal with a financial crisis before shelling out thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at a college, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants is unable to keep up with the rising cost of basic necessities .
Feminists are speaking out against racism and police behavior after the events in Ferguson
Earlier this month, an unarmed young man was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
Those present waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: &quot;Hands up, don&#39;t shoot!&quot;
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of an unarmed young man, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz has noted a shift in white feminist online discourse.
She found that white feminists prioritize gender over race when it comes to advocating for reproductive rights and income equality.
With rising tensions in the Midwest garnering national press attention, Perez has noticed that the response from white women is 100% focused on race.
Compared to black women&#39;s reactions soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines like &quot;A white woman&#39;s thoughts on Ferguson&quot; or &quot;Feminism isn&#39;t just about oppressing women&quot; appeared relatively late.
But according to Perézová, this represents an important change.
&quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level,&quot; she said.
People felt they had to comment on what had happened.
It&#39;s characteristic of the crisis we&#39;re facing because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially charged that they had to call attention to it.
According to Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues African-American women face every day that are not seen as &quot;women&#39;s issues&quot; in the cultural sphere.
&quot;I can post funny stories about life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people all over the world,&quot; Mitchell said.
When I write something about people of color being trapped in their own country, the silence is deafening.
&quot;How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships but not about safety in public space?&quot; she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have addressed race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women today conflate race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women&#39;s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
&quot;Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched, almost all of them because of the rape of a white woman,&quot; Hattery said.
You needed the cooperation of white women to justify lynching.
According to Hattery, the rift between white and black women came when suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the terrain in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or blacks.
&quot;They decided to put their bets on women&#39;s suffrage and focus on black suffrage later,&quot; Hattery explained.
Realizing this gives us important insight into why women of color distrust white women.
We didn&#39;t do a good job.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to organize against lynching in the Southern Women&#39;s Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the upsurge of white feminists&#39; responses to the issues brought up by the events in Ferguson - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to &quot;catch up&quot; with issues that black women had been grappling with for generations.
“Wouldn&#39;t it be great if activists in these spaces [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they take the right to birth control?” suggested Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what that means.
Prominent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after the shooting death of Michael Brown to publish a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian demanding that white Americans protest racism more forcefully.
&quot;My hope is that women who have different, yet similar, reasons for understanding the dangers in society — and views on race that differ widely in public opinion polls — will push for change,&quot; Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem espouses an intersectional feminism that includes both race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of the book &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot; told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are &quot;much more vulnerable than their sisters,&quot; but Steinem&#39;s remarks confront Ferguson the criticism it had previously drawn.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother&#39;s Keeper program to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youth, it sparked outrage from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only issue that is coming to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After US Border Patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the Southwest this year, the issue of immigration reform has resurfaced -- this time as a women&#39;s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration law reform, said that all she had to do was share immigrant women&#39;s stories to make the issue more important to women.
&quot;They speak for themselves,&quot; says Mercadová.
Since most work permits are issued to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position of vulnerability to domestic violence and abuse.
&quot;These stories resonate in women&#39;s organizations,&quot; she said.
Pig residence in Ipswich for sale
An estate agency has removed an image of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was posted it showed a pig resting on it in the living room.
The one-bedroom detached house, which is for sale for £120,000, sits on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included an image of a living room in which a pig is resting with its head on a sofa.
Estate agency Connells said the pig in the photo is the owners&#39; pet.
&quot;The photo ended up there by mistake and has therefore already been removed,&quot; said a spokesperson for the office.
In property information, Connells described the former house of worship as &quot;a unique detached one-bedroom house.&quot;
Although the office has since removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the price.
The southwest town of Harvey has a new millionaire after winning the lottery
Lottery player in Harvey wins a million.
The search is on for a new millionaire in Perth&#39;s south-east, with one lucky winner taking home $1.1 million from Saturday&#39;s lottery draw.
It&#39;s the second time in five years that Harvey&#39;s tobacconists have been lucky to be handed out, the last time in November 2009 being a $1 million prize.
But the lucky winner has yet to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win was the talk of Perth&#39;s south-west.
It&#39;s a major topic and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was within reach.
Eight winners shared one win in Western Australia last month, capping a lucky couple of weeks.
Last weekend, a player at Canning Vale became one of August&#39;s five millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier the pair won a whopping $7.5 million at Belmont.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th single lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains do not run in the evening.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press statement, GDL described the protest as a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose a time outside the rush hour.
By choosing the strike time, GDL takes into account the many people who return from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think about people commuting to work during the day,&quot; the trade union said in a press statement announcing the strike on Monday morning.
&quot;Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less so passengers,&quot; GDL added.
DB has not yet published an official response to the announcement of the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in wages for train drivers and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years of service.
Train drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to increase wages while reducing working hours.
At the same time, they emphasize that the wages of train drivers must develop in the same way as for other railway personnel, for whom the DB does not count on shortening the working week.
There was a threat that Krest&#39;s car would catch fire.
That&#39;s why he ended the rally at Barum
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I had no idea that something like this could happen.
Couldn&#39;t the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service center, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we headed straight there, yes.
But we still had two more erzets waiting for us and that was not possible.
The temperature inside is high and the risk of the car catching fire was high.
I can&#39;t afford that.
You managed five special stages at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like a teenager.
We were fast, but I didn&#39;t go over the vint.
It was all due to the fact that we kept the car for more than half a year to get it to some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You started it in such a way that you could realistically think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car in such a way that we really had a shot at winning.
The work was not in vain.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come.
But that&#39;s Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You were not the only one from the top to retire prematurely from the fight for the top spot.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also dropped out of it.
Were you surprised that so many favorites dropped out?
Yes.
It was a shame, especially for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, for whom you are preparing a car, was also at the top for a long time.
But he paid for it by flying off the track and gaining almost a two-minute deficit.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It&#39;s a shame because he could have repeated the podium.
After all, he ran the first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He drove very fast.
Exactly one year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good driving feeling make you a regular participant in rally races again?
Certainly not at this moment.
Last year I said that Barumka was my last race and I still didn&#39;t keep it.
I decided to ride her again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there&#39;s another chance next year, I&#39;ll probably go for it.
But I don&#39;t think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started precisely because of them.
Lots of people, acquaintances and strangers, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will compete.
I hope he didn&#39;t damage the car too much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow Honzo Sýkor&#39;s fabia from us for this race.
We have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica waiting for us with Mira.
For that, we will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you suggest something already?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsica Rally was part of the World Championship, you achieved your series high with fifth place.
Are you not tempted to try the tracks there again?
It doesn&#39;t attract.
A verbal agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a certificate of incapacity for work issued by a doctor, which serves as proof for the organization that you are unable to perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify your employer of your absence.
Subsequently, an agreement was reached that the given days would be registered as a holiday, but the agreement was only made verbally.
Although the Labor Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer&#39;s consent to taking leave confirmed in writing, this procedure has proven itself in practice.
If there is only a verbal agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, as in your case, the alleged consent to taking leave may be denied and the absence from work considered a long-term unexcused absence, thus a reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship according to § 53 of the Labor Code.
In the event of a lawsuit about the agreement with the employer, you lack provable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you was not canceled according to § 53, you only have the given days listed in the credit card as an unexcused absence.
An unexcused absence in the credit card does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving unemployment benefits), but it does make it more difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor in question again and get a written confirmation that there really was an injury, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called &quot;incapacity&quot;, it is only a doctor&#39;s certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present the aforementioned document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to taking leave.
This way you avoid possible complications.
Tony Stewart&#39;s crash on track return
Tony Stewart&#39;s return to the track ended just short of the halfway mark at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the second time after his right front tire blew on lap 172, ending the race for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car to the garage, did not comment to reporters and left.
Team principal Chad Johnston said the No. 14 car team is disappointed but will now focus on next weekend&#39;s race at Richmond, Virginia.
&quot;I would like us to have a better performance and a better finish,&quot; Johnston said.
We will go to Richmond and hope to do better there.
Stewart hit the road for the first time in Sunday night&#39;s race after a collision with Kyle Busch that required repairs to the right side of his car.
&quot;We were hoping for a good finish going into today&#39;s race,&quot; Johnston said, adding: &quot;It just didn&#39;t work out.&quot;
Not long after the second crash, Stewart&#39;s car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to go.
After his car struck and killed another driver at the New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to make a comeback this weekend, needing to win either the Atlanta race or the following race in Richmond to catch up in the standings.
He returned to racing during the investigation into the tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove into Stewart&#39;s path during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the crash will take at least two more weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started 12th, worked his way up to 10th early in the race and then even 4th.
Then, at the start of lap 122, Busch&#39;s car no.
18 went out of control going out of turn two and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars into the embankment.
Stewart continued but dropped back to 21st.
Prague has chosen a new manager of taxi stands, they will earn 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection process for new managers of taxi service stations.
It receives approximately 12.3 million crowns annually for 103 parking spaces.
At the same time, until recently, it collected 150,000 crowns per year for the same positions for taxi drivers.
Councilor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) informed about it.
Previously, the city used a lottery to select administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a flat sum of 1,000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, the bid amount is decisive.
&quot;One year after the termination of the original leases and the start of tenders, it has been proven that the new system of leases is far more advantageous and generally fairer for Prague,&quot; the councilor claims.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in a site in Na Perštýně Street.
They pay 2.1 million crowns annually.
The new administrators paid approximately 1.5 million crowns for places in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
Councilors adopted new rules for renting taxi service stations in the fall of 2012 and terminated the original lease agreements in the summer of last year.
Selection procedures were held in four waves and 29 positions found a new administrator.
We had to clean the well for the second time this year.
We drained it completely each time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo in there.
Incredible smell!
Our well in the basement always provided plenty of wonderful scented water.
And it wasn&#39;t expertly made, Grandpa dug it out himself.
Long time ago.
It was only about three rings and overall quirky, like everything else at the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we ran out of water.
When she stood there for many months, she deserved it.
But even then it seemed to us that the water did not smell somehow.
We wondered if something had fallen there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, the plate didn&#39;t quite fit there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing could be seen in the water, and we shone through it all the way to the bottom.
So we drained it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
But we noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a glued package with some dice on the ground.
At least that&#39;s what it looked like.
And another one a little further.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where there are vents, grandfather&#39;s invention, there were remains of fish!
And hard eaten!
Our cellar is also quirky.
Some would say that grandpa simply ransacked the cottage.
And he wouldn&#39;t be so far from the truth.
The walls and floor are only packed sand, only the ceiling is underlaid.
There are mainly ships.
And the wheels.
And beach chairs.
The wide gaping gate was mostly open as someone walked in one piece.
Several already mentioned vents near the ceiling.
Without a net, so birds usually fly in there and build their nests on the beams.
It is unnecessary to mention the mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fly, and it did.
Now, however, even the air didn&#39;t help.
The whole basement stank.
So we also cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw out the things that were around: boards, Heraclitus board, and so on.
Our cottage greeted passers-by with a disinfectant wipe from a distance.
We wondered who could have handed us the disgusting leftovers?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in a village.
It would be hard for her to come to our place for a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who is not quite well.
If that Franta didn&#39;t shove the disgusting stuff in there through his vent?
He&#39;s here practically all year round, stupid ideas, that&#39;s what he has.
We decided to keep an eye on the cellar and the well and check them regularly.
After a few days everything was fine.
We started using water again, for now only for washing and washing, until the tests are finished, but it was already good.
Drawing water from a forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
Once we heard a terrible anxious bark of our female.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza was jumping above her and squealing like crazy.
Mom scolded her because she thought Réza dug the waste hose out of the sink.
But suddenly the hose partially coiled into a ball and partially straightened.
A hiss sounded on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
The snake, well over a meter long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented it from doing so.
It wasn&#39;t clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was beside the point.
When the snake saw the superiority in the form of our whole family, it must have said to itself that we should eat it, since we are so cute, and elegantly crawled through the vent into the cellar.
We flew after her.
Like lightning she jumped behind the well.
Just by the way, we noticed another smelly package on her desk.
According to the smell, probably fish.
She wasn&#39;t there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a shambles.
And we locked the cellar even during the day.
That...
We went outside and there we each lay down next to one vent.
We didn&#39;t wait long.
It rattled behind the well.
The first to appear was a flat head with yellow marigolds on its neck.
Then the whole snake swung onto the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to make her way inside.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
After being fired, the disgraced employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money he received before being detained by the police.
In a short period of time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
&quot;After the takeover, he took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them at bazaars,&quot; said Rostislav Brückner, chief commissioner of Šumper police.
The motive of the frauds was to take revenge on the employer for the dismissal and also to gain money.
&quot;During the interrogation, he claimed to us that he used the money to repay the loans,&quot; Brückner said.
The police also discovered that the fraudster is a pathological gambler who has repeatedly received psychiatric treatment.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
&quot;The fact is we didn&#39;t find any money on him,&quot; said the commissioner.
The fraudster, who has already been convicted of theft, now faces a prison term of one to five years.
The police have not yet said whether there is also a threat of punishment for bazaars that bought laptops below the price and continued to sell them.
&quot;It is true that they were receiving completely new goods, which is at least suspicious,&quot; stated the commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have been charged yet.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it, or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest one was a route change that brought the destination to the beach instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race along with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took pictures and filmed videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I took on the role of personal guide.
Together with my friend Káťa, we obediently lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends who were walking past us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn&#39;t much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
Screams of joy, but instead of a fast start, there was a rush to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, I turn on the measurement and we start at ten o&#39;clock pace.
We weave through a yellow snake of runners who, like Káťa, are running their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly sinking sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad an almost cheesy touch.
The pulsating mass stretching along the embankment looks as if the whole of Prague runs here.
On the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theater, it is traditionally starting to show who has how much power.
The slight hill on Palacký náměstí forces many runners to slow down or switch to walking.
Just before the crossing to Divadelní, I see a police escort and right behind it Vítek Pavlišta is flying at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I can hear the other runners sighing in admiration.
I move to the edge of the track, encouraging him, he&#39;s about to slap me, but just before that, my leg sprains and our hands narrowly miss.
Running down Divadelní Street gives you a chance to rest and breathe.
It is necessary, there are places ahead of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all its beauty as the sun sets.
I can&#39;t breathe and my legs carry me almost by themselves.
After the first snack comes the moment of truth.
When crossing the road, Káťa skids over the curb and performs a jump.
I check to see if she needs help and start a series of encouraging words so she doesn&#39;t have time to think about the pain.
It rises and we continue along Kozí ulič, it is one of the narrowest parts of the track, at this stage of the race there is not such a rush, but you still need to keep a close eye on the surroundings.
I don&#39;t know yet that the concept of the tightest place will acquire its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate, tourists and friends of other runners are frantically cheering us on.
I try to clap with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Katy to do the same, because ten claps with the fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are accelerating again and even though we have fallen quite significantly, now the chase has begun.
We overtake dozens of runners, when I pass someone who is particularly tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: &quot;Come on, just a little more, you can do it!&quot;
After the last snack bar, no one overtakes us anymore, we speed up.
So far we have been running for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
The three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but you really need to push yourself.
The sun has already slowly set and the ending day is symbolically slowly ending the race.
The last run to the bridge, a turn and just a straight line to the finish line.
The pace we&#39;re running makes me wonder where this girl is coming from?
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go before three o&#39;clock, let&#39;s go!&quot; i&#39;m calling
We try it, we sprint and the goal is here.
The hour is thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of one hour and twenty.
So seven minutes behind schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just after the finish line, Kata&#39;s legs give out, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
She shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a job well done.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
The euphoria does not make us think about the crowding in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
Here you can see that Kozí ulička was not the narrowest place.
This means that there is a floodplain behind the finish line, which is packed to bursting under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners.
If someone doesn&#39;t like crowds, this is not the place for them.
Even I lose my mind after a while and wonder if the wonderful views and the more interesting route compared to previous years were worth what happens at the finish line.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all traffic are added to this, it becomes a huge challenge.
This year&#39;s route change showed runners many interesting places, but also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in Žluty Lázně was transmitted among the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track as well as random spectators stepped it up on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, an urban run through the historic center has to take into account obstacles that cannot be removed, but I don&#39;t think the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered on one side by a wall and on the other by a river is the best solution.
If I tell myself that the race ended by crossing the finish line, I rate it as very successful.
After the finish I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you also liked the route and what you say about the situation at the finish line.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria took part in a nationwide protest rally outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demand for the re-introduction of the original working conditions, which had recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on the list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The supervisors symbolically protested the new working hours for a month and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
&quot;Negotiations are still ongoing,&quot; the head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Home Office Staff Unions are also expected to join the protests by Prison Service staff.
Why can the universe have multiple dimensions and we can&#39;t see them?
Physicists don&#39;t usually write bestsellers, but in 1999 Brian Greene of Columbia University managed to hit the nail on the head.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for the layman to penetrate the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today - the attempt to unify two brilliantly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity.
Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for the success of The Elegant Universe is that in the case of the search for a unified theory of physics, it is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (because at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and are solving it so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to laymen.
In addition, Greene handled the complex material in such a fresh and engaging manner that he cannot be blamed for not including much of the interesting in his book.
Moreover, he mostly corrected his &quot;mistake&quot; in two other books: Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
The author probably wouldn&#39;t object to his book becoming obsolete more quickly, but the fact is that even after 15 years, The Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years there will be a bit more activity in this field (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally go &quot;full throttle&quot;), so it is a good time to enter the door of the world of modern physics that Green has gently opened.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe might have more than three spatial dimensions may certainly sound silly, fantastical, strange, or mystical.
Nevertheless, it is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let&#39;s turn our gaze for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more mundane, namely a long and thin garden hose.
Imagine stretching a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the entire scenery from half a kilometer away (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily see a long hose stretched horizontally, but unless you are very clairvoyant, you can hardly make out the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you&#39;d think that an ant forced to live on a hose would only have one dimension to walk in: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you answer with just one piece of information: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we mean by all this is that from half a kilometer away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, hose has thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In this magnified view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the &quot;clockwise/counter-clockwise dimension&quot;, i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of the little ant you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle that wraps around the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on perturbation string theory.
Non-disruptive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the circumferential dimension, indicated by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimension wrapping the circumference of the hose is short, &quot;rolled&quot; and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
The mentioned example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, extensive and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, rolled up and much more difficult to observe.
Of course, in the mentioned case, we didn&#39;t exactly go out of our way to reveal the &quot;rolled&quot; dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose.
It was enough to take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only reveal the coiled dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his paper to Einstein in 1919, in which he presented the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than the three dimensions we all know.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by saying that the additional dimension provides an elegant and compelling framework in which Einstein&#39;s general relativity and Maxwell&#39;s electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this Kaluz observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see precisely three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein clearly stated and specified in 1926, rests on the proposition that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and convoluted dimensions.
This means that, just like the dimensions along the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at every moment.
But analogous to the circular circumference of a garden hose, the universe may also have additional dimensions, tightly coiled into a space so tiny that they have so far remained hidden even from our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz&#39;s remarkable proposal, let&#39;s stay with the hose for a moment.
Imagine that we draw a relatively dense series of circles on the circumference of the hose with black paint.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we can now reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, a total of four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To give our imagination a little help, let&#39;s notice the illustration in Fig.3; shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in the same way as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are rolled into a small enough space; this is how we explain that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid represents the commonly known &quot;large&quot; dimensions, while the circle represents the new, tiny, coiled dimension.
Just like the loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - only for the sake of clarity we have drawn them only at the intersections of the square grid.
The background of figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - at such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each subsequent image, we focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it so that it becomes visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see in the first few zoom levels.
However, when we go further in our journey of the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new dimension coiled into a circle, similar to the loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of the large dimensions, just as a hose has a circular circumference at every point along its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn the circular dimension only in some regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein&#39;s idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular coiled dimension is extremely miniature, it is - like the circular circumference of the hose - much more difficult to recognize than to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our state-of-the-art magnification tools.
But most importantly, the extra dimension is not just a round bump inside the regular dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of the three common vast dimensions.
It is a dimension independent of the other three dimensions, just as the top-down, left-right and front-back dimensions are independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the usual three, the position in the circular dimension; if we also count the time, then five figures, in any case one more than we would normally expect.
Are you interested?
You can buy the book The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene here at knyhy.idnes.cz.
The price for the e-book is CZK 149.
So, to our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein&#39;s reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize structures as large as a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can barely observe the smaller coiled dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz&#39;s original idea with several ideas from the nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about one Planck length in size, a size far beyond the resolving power of today&#39;s instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional tiny spatial dimensions the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honzo Homol advises how to practice the electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of &quot;twelve&quot; lies in the twelve-bar harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Those who dabble in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
A puppeteer and puppeteer by education, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been making a living as a graphic designer since graduating twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, from which, unfortunately, it is said that he cannot leave.
He is a guitarist after his father, just like his brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start practicing on one string.
&quot;The rhythmic model is up to you, you can come up with anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of twelve,&quot; advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the shape again.
You just have to listen and watch Honza, what you can come up with with 12th harmony on two strings and how nice it starts to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth one, watch out for the tuning change, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to pentatonic and you will try to put it together with twelve.
So practice it honestly.
You can read about it as best as possible in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school of playing the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It is not for a big celebration, Dvořák from Hradec Kność admits
We take the point and are happy for it.
In the first half, we had more chances, the home side in the second,&quot; said the striker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
Weren&#39;t you nervous when playing it, after all, it was accompanied by a tremendous hiss?
I didn&#39;t particularly notice it, although it would probably be worse at the second goal, where there are home fans.
You equalized with a penalty after half an hour, but you also scored from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep in the beginning, we were passive, it resulted in a corner and then a penalty after that.
After that you got up and in the first half you were the better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well after conceding a goal until the break.
We thought in the cabin that we wanted to maintain the pace of the game after that, but we couldn&#39;t.
To be honest, I can&#39;t even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home team had something to say about their game during the break, they were probably not very satisfied with it.
You have only scored for the first time on the opponent&#39;s field, while at home you have not even scored a goal yet.
Why is there such a difference?
I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s that much of a difference, it&#39;s more up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that&#39;s a different category.
You waited for a goal for four matches, weren&#39;t you worried that it might be similar after the last match?
Perhaps not, but of course we are glad that we don&#39;t have to listen to talk about waiting for a goal since the last match.
Now we&#39;ve added another without waiting, but it&#39;s still only three in six games, which isn&#39;t much to celebrate.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater kilometers away.
Lava rising to the surface in the Holuhraun region near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometer distant crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for now.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) approximately the same amount of lava is still ejected from the fissure.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but &quot;only&quot; 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption on 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could also open in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, and with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean massive flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulfur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases are rising from the fissure.
It is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also much more gases,&quot; says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, there was almost no wind in the area in the morning.
The tracks of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange level (second highest) applies to Bárðarbunga and yellow (third) to Askja.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Aviation day in Cheb.
Aerial acrobat Peggy Walentinová presented herself on a Boeing Stearman PT-17, climbing from the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There, she relies only on muscle strength.
The Aviation Day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year, and the organizers once again managed to prepare several interesting aerial stunts.
Not only &quot;walking on the wings&quot; performed by the German acrobat Peggy Walentinová, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or the Beechcraft 18 airplane had its premiere at the oldest Czech airport.
He drew attention to himself with his bright coating.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the USA.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to establish themselves in this way.
But it was banned due to the large number of fatalities.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the program of aviation days.
After takeoff, Peggy climbs out of the cockpit and onto the upper wing.
There he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the plane, where her show continues,&quot; described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the aviation day.
Her husband Friedrich is the pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E.
If Peggy&#39;s performance was the highlight of the program, then the subsequent performance of the Mustang fighter was the proverbial icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the area with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called by numbers).
Aviation fans in the Czech Republic could see such a lineup for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatics with an airplane from 1945.
It was still made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was enlisted in the army reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichov Hradiště.
Another pearl of the Cheb aviation day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor, is also at the same place.
At the airport, the massive machine could not be overlooked.
Its polished aluminum skin shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of the French Air Force also won admiration.
A small transport plane jumped behind the abandoned Turbolet and from the German Hof brought part of the German delegation to the air day.
The German neighbors showed off in Cheb with reconstructed Yak 18T planes or a three-man formation of Bücker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
At least for tonight, Lucie Borhyová exchanged her parental worries for her work ones.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter obviously knows nothing about it.
The TV news anchor was doing well for her, as if she had not stopped with him for two months at all!
It has only been two weeks since the blonde ended her six-month period, during which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in TV Nova&#39;s main news program yet.
According to information from Blesk.cz, she can expect a regular return in a month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than the TV viewers.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the television screen and it was a hit.
Exhibition in a year in Prague?
The hall would be sold out, Jágr is planning a farewell
It would be dignified if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union reacts to it,&quot; he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the breathtaking team from Nagano met again.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat trick.
The players would like it, wouldn&#39;t they?
Certainly.
In short, it would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, one or two days can be found during the tournament when there is complete free time and where such a match could be mixed in.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Béď Ščerban (organizer of the Jihlava match), who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play New Jersey in the playoffs?
So when I arrive...
But you don&#39;t want to play in the national team.
Or did the meeting in Jihlava somehow change your decision?
National team and exhibition match are two different things and in the national team performances are decisive.
It&#39;s one thing that people would like to see me there, but performances are decisive, especially at the World Cup.
Players who have what it takes should go there, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy the nagan reunion?
Just meeting the players was great.
You brought the stories to life and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it is good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that a generation that was really worth it is passing away.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the switchboard.
Do you still remember your first national team match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: myself, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, started in one trio.
It was the first representative start for all of them.
Well, you can&#39;t say that we somehow dominate.
Dominik Hašek caught in Jihlava after a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can&#39;t (Hašek criticized Jágr for the reasons why he decided to quit the national team).
Hnilička also performed well.
At the same time, he came to train with me one night and there was a leak.
And now he was catching famously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the qualification begins for the footballers
Prominent guests came to the NH Hotel in Smíchov on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, national team coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, that figure in the black cap, that&#39;s Tomáš Rosický!
The Arsenal midfielder and captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around 12:30 among the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn&#39;t be looking forward to it?&quot; he said when he appeared in front of journalists in his national team kit.
Program of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1: start of the meeting, first practice
Tuesday, September 2: Training open to fans (6:30 p.m. Summer) Autograph session (8:00 p.m.)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday, September 9 Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of the meeting
Rosický et al. fans can support before Wednesday&#39;s match against the USA (20:15).
The national team has opened Tuesday training for them, which starts at 18:30 at Letná.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, at which neither Rosický nor Čech will be present.
Otherwise, however, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
This is appreciated by coach Vrba, who complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to focus on.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It&#39;s an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that we haven&#39;t had so much time for so far,&quot; praised Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The national team has played three games under Vrba, all preparatory games.
They drew 2:2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1:2 with Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
Only now.
The qualification for the 2016 European Championship will start with the match against the Netherlands.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they also managed the warm-up against the USA.
The first semester was for us to get to know each other.
Results are important now.
We have to think about being successful,&quot; agreed Vrba.
The only player in the twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is forward David Lafata.
He is suffering from a temperature.
If he didn&#39;t have time to recover for Wednesday&#39;s match against the USA, coach Vrba would call up one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she was going to die for many years after being misdiagnosed.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years believing she only had a few years left to live.
It was actually Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can present with motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
Those affected may also experience numbness or pain, the condition is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she had Freidreich&#39;s Ataxia (FA), a condition with a very poor prognosis.
She believed she would be wheelchair-bound before her eighteenth birthday and dead by the time she turned thirty.
The mother of two, now 51, says: “As a child I knew I couldn&#39;t do the same things as others.
Every day I fell and everything took longer.
I could never roller skate or skateboard with the other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran.&#39;
When Rodgers was thirteen and coming off several surgeries to release her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room to consult her records, where she learned she had FA.
&quot;I felt guilty because I was snooping so I didn&#39;t tell anyone, but when I got home I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA,&quot; she says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I completely panicked.
I thought that by the time I was eighteen, I would be in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my faculties.
I was all alone and I was planning my funeral.&#39;
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had assumed and asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up and hugged her and said, “Sweetheart, I don&#39;t think you have the disease, or you&#39;d be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening.&#39;
After undergoing several genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was lucky,” she said.
The CMT UK charity has launched CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease.
Washington area entrepreneurs: taxes rise as economy turns around
A growing economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
And higher taxes too.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local business taxes across the country rose slightly last year as the economy accelerated, and Washington businesses were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia contributed a combined $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal year 2013, a 3.8% increase over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared with 3.9% the previous year, marking the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were cut.
According to the study, by professional firm Ernst &amp; Young and the Center on State Taxation, a political group, state taxes rose faster, at 4.3%, than local levies, at 3.9%.
More than half of the district&#39;s tax revenue, 56%, is from the business tax, and 36% of Maryland&#39;s revenue is from corporations.
Virginia, at 28%, has proportionally the least business tax revenue.
Researchers say the majority of tax revenue growth came from increases in the value of business-owned properties, which increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of -1% growth.
Although most of the profit comes from big states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the situation is the same in Washington.
Companies in DC, Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, a 4.2% year-over-year increase from $9.6 billion in 2012.
But the apparent increase in property values doesn&#39;t drive up state and local tax revenue as much in Maryland, where property taxes account for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and DC, property taxes account for nearly half of state and local taxation.
&quot;A lot of real estate in Maryland is owned by businesses, primarily the tax base around DC, by government or non-profit organizations that don&#39;t pay taxes,&quot; explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business income also appears to be increasing.
Businesses in the region posted $2.3 billion in corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing at the same rate in these three places.
DC&#39;s growth rate was in line with the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland&#39;s growth was significantly higher at 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the tax increase below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of the three districts (all of which are taxed the same), at 6%.
Maryland&#39;s corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the DC average remains relatively high at 9.975%.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
DC did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed into law cutting the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and the tax will drop to 5% next year.
If the state continues to meet revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could drop to as low as 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small business owners in Washington are doing better and therefore paying higher state and local taxes.
The business tax levied by small business owners as a personal income tax — the structure to offset cost increases by raising prices by which most businesses are organized — rose 20% to $2.4 billion in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers say the trend and statewide business tax increases are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenue for state and local governments rising 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
But Washington may be lagging behind as government spending cuts take a toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Tusk will be the head of Europe, Putin&#39;s Novorussia and Lafat&#39;s scissors
Will a new state emerge in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that they will have a difficult time returning to the Russian market after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions.
According to him, the support given to the West by the Ukrainian army&#39;s warfare in the east of Ukraine contradicts democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kyiv, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic claimed the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose a form of further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member countries, told journalists.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals for changing the form of sanctions should be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU &quot;president&quot;.
He will replace Van Rompuy in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at the summit of the European Union to head the European Council, i.e. the so-called EU president, who directs the summit meetings of the member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton as head of European diplomacy.
The Italian woman, who will thus become vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed in the position by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it&#39;s just not talked about
Help an incurable and long-term suffering patient to die?
In Czech conditions, where the law does not allow euthanasia, it is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, it follows from the statements of doctors contacted by LN that they hear about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says a doctor about sclerosis
Approximately three hundred people in the Czech Republic suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients are undergoing experimental treatment with stem cells in Prague&#39;s Motol.
We don&#39;t know for sure if it will be successful.
But if we don&#39;t try, we won&#39;t find out,&quot; says Radim Mazanec, a neurologist in Motol.
The handwriting of the CIA can be seen in this, they needed war, writes Huml about the shooting down of flight MH17
ČSSD deputy Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that &quot;the tough sanctions that were announced with regard to the downing of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army&quot;.
According to the lawmaker, it also shows the handwriting of the CIA.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties are once again offering the impossible
An end to the homeless on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car above Prague.
It is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Even now, with municipal elections approaching, politicians are competing to see who the voters will like more.
The Lidovky.cz server has selected unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege began
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and included this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the hands of German troops.
SUMMARY: Pilsen leads the league ahead of &quot;S&quot; Prague, Liberec outclassed Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, leading by one point ahead of both &quot;S&quot; from Prague.
The changes at the top of the table were caused by Slavia&#39;s 1:2 defeat in Mladá Boleslav.
Sparta recovered after two defeats in the domestic league, beating Jablonec thanks to Lafat&#39;s two hits.
The record win of the year was claimed by Liberec, which defeated Baník Ostrava 6:0.
62 thousand spectators at volleyball?
Poles say yes
The opening of the World Volleyball Championship in Warsaw brought a record audience.
At the football stadium under a cloudy roof, 62,000 spectators watched the smooth victory of the home team over Serbia.
The tickets were sold out in 100 minutes.
How to survive the return from vacation?
Take your time and get some sleep
The last days of the holidays are upon us.
Getting used to a normal work pace after returning from a sunny beach or a cottage can be difficult for many.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips to cope with the changed situation: take your time and enjoy quality sleep.
Joan Rivers&#39; family: &#39;Fingers crossed&#39;
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since being rushed to a New York City hospital, but her daughter said today that she is not giving up hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
&quot;Thank you for your greetings and support,&quot; Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We&#39;re keeping our fingers crossed for her.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to 911 said she had gone into cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy on the Upper East Side, a source said.
Doctors are deliberately keeping her sedated and under close observation until they are sure of her condition, which remains &quot;serious&quot;.
Reactions were not long in coming, including incredible online support from celebrities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted by headlines
That the media distort reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines &quot;sell&quot; newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called &quot;readers&quot; who do not read anything else.
And this is a fact that has been bothering me a lot lately, the word annoying is more accurate.
This particularly applies to articles about the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines &quot;Israel attacked Gaza&quot; are quite common.
You will only read in the text that the Israeli &quot;attack&quot; was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the announced ceasefire.
Then the headline &quot;Both sides violated the ceasefire&quot; appears.
Does the journalistic community realize that, by doing so, it is directly participating in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogans like &quot;Jewish scum&quot; and similar monstrosities, it made me cringe.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews, the Slavs were destined for liquidation?
Ladies and gentlemen journalists, please put a little more care into your work.
You are often referred to as the &quot;watchdogs of democracy&quot;.
So defend her.
As long as he&#39;s here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbors decided to eliminate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the world map?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in Israel.
And they are fine there.
If you ask them why they don&#39;t go among &quot;their own&quot;, for example to Gaza, will they answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-notch health care (I saw with my own eyes how Arabs regularly go to the top-notch Hadassah private hospital, which is funded by sponsorships from Jews from all over the world, and are, of course, treated there).
Hamas also attacks its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus for this restive region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in the headlines.
Report on the practices of Hamas, its abuse of people as human shields.
Report that Hamas aims to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in the nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area was able to flourish thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, of course, the administrators of Gaza do not pay and even get angry that the electricity supply is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide attackers could penetrate the territory of Israel, but in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed a claim by Information from Monday morning: The online retailer - a producer of videos and hundreds of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch&#39;s sale to Google for $1 billion seemed certain, and the merger seemed like a natural fit.
Founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, Twitch was poised to become a mainstream video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream their games online to it - in the words of Business Insider, &quot;YouTube for live gaming&quot;.
Twitch interface.
&quot;Let&#39;s play&quot; videos, the kind where nerds (mostly older) give games the Mystery Science Theater treatment, are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn&#39;t really excite anyone, it was a textbook example of an established company paying off a potential competitor.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn&#39;t work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: &quot;We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, share our values and long-term vision, and want to help us deliver faster.&quot;
Another mystery is the - frankly - incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim to play sports rather than watch them, it&#39;s hard to see what&#39;s so great about just watching the games instead of actually playing them.
It&#39;s one thing to watch your friend play Resident Evil over your shoulder at three in the morning, and it&#39;s quite another to watch a stranger take twenty hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today&#39;s most popular games are from the player&#39;s perspective, so watching their footage without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I&#39;ll admit that speed run games where the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time are fun.
But unless someone is a master of gaming or humor, their Twitch channel probably won&#39;t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is the fourth highest in Internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of this?
It&#39;s hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube might have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that every business would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch &quot;believe in the future of gaming,&quot; and the media doesn&#39;t seem to be holding back, nor do - gulp - viewers.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the topic &quot;Holy scriptures are the word of God.&quot;
Original video attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by god and not by actual human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, we are often faced with the question: Whom will you believe?
The alleged word of God, or the word of man?
As if human investigation were nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say &quot;man&quot;, they are talking about science.
And when they refer to the &quot;word of God&quot;, they refer to myths about God written down by humans.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then he is the one who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and he must be the one who devised the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and he must be the one who supplied the other lines evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion down to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he&#39;s trying to tell us something!
Humans could not create any of those things.
But people know how to tell stories, to tell stories.
And it was men who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
By people who were &quot;moved&quot; or &quot;inspired&quot; by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by none other than mere mortals with some degree of imagination, not angels and certainly not gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of such magnitude ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, one holy scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors could not measure up to such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If god had written it, we would expect nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, all continually breaking up into more and more separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, each claiming divine guidance in some way, regardless of continued divergence and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bahá&#39;u&#39;lláh&#39;s Kitáb-i-Aqdás, Zarathustra&#39;s Avesta, the Sikh Adí-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Urantia Book are all considered &quot;absolute truth&quot; and &quot;revealed the word of the one true god&quot; and the respective believers of each say that the others are misguided.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is misguided to some degree.
None of the books mentioned above have any advantage over the others.
None of them are supported by evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I&#39;m a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proven the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn&#39;t.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apologies (defenses), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive notions once believed to be true that have since been overcome.
So they cannot be said to be proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies - with the understanding that each may also contain prophecies that were not fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn&#39;t call it a contradiction, more like mutual comments.
We have to point out again that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is definitely not an eyewitness account!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, i.e. the five Books of &quot;Moses&quot;, and do not credit Moses with the authorship of any of them, since he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Scholars agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) from several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docetites and Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a sort of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these modifications relates to a king of Ugarit who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and changed Ba&#39;al Zebul, &quot;Lord of the Mountain&quot; to Beelzebub, &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;
So the Bible has been deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Council of Nicaea.
Four gospels were accepted and sixteen others rejected by a simple show of hands, as if the fact of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about in the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon thus developed from the confines of the early church.
So the council simply accepted as gospel whatever relevant stories were circulating among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though the books that were approved referred to them.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both apostles and prophets.
Why should God&#39;s word refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be thus approved, if God were the real author of this haphazard mixture of fable, parable, and psalm-lyric?
The Bible was definitely written by people and certainly not by enlightened people, rather the opposite!
This is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, on almost anything from start to finish.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in incantations, blood sacrifices, ritual charms, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand to sprinkle blood on someone, it would cure them of leprosy.
We&#39;re talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and thought pi was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed striped patterns to a pregnant cow, she would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say this?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, then it would not have contained such errors as it does.
If it had come from the pen of a truly superior being and had been intended as literal history, then it would have contained nothing at all of what it contains.
It totally fails as a moral guide because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who condoned or supported animal cruelty, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family member abuse, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, pillage, murder , cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To justify their inhumanity by claiming that they are doing God&#39;s will.
Yet creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact contradicts the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn&#39;t have their beloved books, they wouldn&#39;t have god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God&#39;s &quot;work&quot; as &quot;creature worship instead of creator&quot;.
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly &quot;holy&quot; books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of god but all versions of god.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that god could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were god himself because they think they are HIS word.
But god never wrote or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion.
Everything that men have approved or rejected into their supposedly &quot;immutable word&quot; of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered and distorted by mere fallible humans.

A participant in the bucket challenge dislocated her jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom screamed so hard that she damaged the bone structure of her face when she poured ice water on her head.
This bucket challenge failed.
A woman was hospitalized after she dislocated her jaw by screaming during a bucket challenge.
While pouring ice water over her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged the bone structure in her face.
&quot;The water was so cold I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen,&quot; she told The Mirror.

The attacker stabbed nine people in a Chinese school, three of them died
According to the New China Agency, a man named Chen forced his way into the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around half past eleven local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China reported, citing the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one child in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the first-graders in Lány how he had to sit at school
The youngest schoolchildren were taken by the ninth graders to their classroom, where they waited with the teacher for the arrival of the president.
He then showed the children how he had to sit in school by himself.
&quot;We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, luckily that&#39;s no longer the case, you&#39;re free people,&quot; Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first graders a puzzle as a gift.

The school management approached him some time ago at a hockey game in Litvínov.
&quot;They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the opening of the school year,&quot; the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
115,000 first-graders entered the first grades this year.
A total of over 850,000 children will go to primary schools and over 405,000 students will study in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of Nova news is David Fiala
David Fiala became the new art director of news and journalism of Nova TV as of September 1.
He replaces Alan Záruba, who has been the head of the creative department of the entire Nova group since June 1.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of news television Z1.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he participated in the implementation of a complete visual transformation of the news programs of Televizní noviny, Štřepiny, Prásk! and other journalistic programs of Nova TV.
David Fiala masters very well the synergy of communication between the editorial office, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of a news art director.
He has a feeling for typography and a clean, elegant design, which is the path we want to take further in the visuals of Nova&#39;s news,&quot; says Nova&#39;s creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud allegedly succumbed to hackers, nude pictures of celebrities became public
A screenshot listing the leaked files
So far, an anonymous user on the 4chan server is publishing nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com pointed out.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has yet to comment on the issue.
Some of the celebrities reject the pictures as fakes, but several of them have already admitted the authenticity of the pictures.
Among them are the actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played, for example, in Death Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos for enrichment.
US magazines have reportedly shown interest in the footage, but according to reports on the 4chan server, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it is very likely a vulnerability in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that made it possible to obtain passwords to user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
The tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was made public.
iCloud users should therefore change their Apple ID password as a precaution.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
A length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The leak of nude pictures of celebrities should be considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in homes or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files first before uploading them.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of photos from the phone to take place only on Wi-Fi and when connected to the charger.
That way, you will have the opportunity to move sensitive images &quot;to safety&quot; in time, and most importantly, you will have the space to delete unsuccessful images, so that they will not unnecessarily take up space in the online storage.
We offer HN and IHNED.cz readers instructions on how to encrypt files and communications on the Internet in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
The Smart Way to Save on College Scripts
With the cost of college scripts exceeding $1,000 a year for many students, an incoming sophomore has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from his upper-classmen, offering nominal compensation to hold off selling them back.
&quot;I got a calculus book that normally costs $180 for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,&quot; says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing those expenses.
Internet stores and creative solutions like Schroeder&#39;s are becoming the preferred choice of students.
Textbook lending is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount compared to buying it.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
An industry survey shows that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were borrowed last spring semester, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased from college bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower online than in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of &quot;Calculus&quot; by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler has a suggested retail price of nearly $290, but can be purchased new online at Chegg.com, a textbook retailer, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don&#39;t mind other people&#39;s notes or wear and tear, used textbooks are a good option.
On Chegg.com, &quot;Calculus&quot; retails for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for a used copy of &quot;Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business&quot; on Amazon.com.
It retailed for $48 new.
Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst&#39;s College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their instructors to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are not essential for work in seminars.
If so, older editions may sell for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc&#39;s Half.com is also a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
Borrowing textbooks is also worth considering, if you treat them well, don&#39;t forget to return them and don&#39;t need to have them even after the seminar is over.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow &quot;Calculus&quot; for an entire semester for about twenty dollars.
Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of the store where you are borrowing the book, including penalties for annotations, highlighting or wear and tear.
Keep in mind: If you don&#39;t return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.
Chegg rents &quot;Calculus&quot; for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, literature students can find the best deals, as many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
By all means, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdine Law School, recommends going by the ISBN because it ensures you&#39;re buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it&#39;s actually in stock, Gault advises.
He saw it for himself.
The book he bought was out of stock for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Mud, just mud.
And then they found a rifle torso from the end of the war in the well
The well stands not far from the church of St. George.
We uncovered the surrounding vegetation and began to pull out the old deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we were approaching the clay bottom, we ran into a barrel,&quot; Radomil Novák recounted.
We pulled it out, cleaned it and found it to be the torso of a German assault rifle used by the SS.
The find is said to be unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them,&quot; Novák added.
All the wooden structural things have decomposed over time, so it is unusable.
However, her body is preserved - it keeps its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
It may have been dropped there by people who needed to get rid of a weapon used by the SS, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn&#39;t do that.
They were throwing weapons away in the forest,&quot; thinks the finder.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from the Jeseníky Rainbow Movement found in the well.
&quot;There could also have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them all around here, that&#39;s why we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt the mud to avoid any accidents, but there was nothing else down there,&quot; explained Novák.
The find will end up in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet freed the captured Czech
Aktuálně.cz exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from captivity by pro-Russian separatists.
Kyiv/Prague - &quot;Excuse me, I have to take it... they are calling me from Donetsk,&quot; Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War there, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban specifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
&quot;That will be it - go there,&quot; he finished one of the flash discussions with Donetsk and turned to ours again.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the reserve, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Just yesterday - when we arranged the interview - he was in Donetsk.
He devotes himself twenty-four hours a day to the liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that Czechs are also fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to be up to thirty.
However, there can be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already freed captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede, a Georgian... but not the Czechs yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captured compatriot and can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise Czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian volunteer battalions and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men mercenaries for hire and they don&#39;t deserve anything but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them, for example, a Czech - they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you already managed to rescue?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources state that it had long since exceeded a hundred men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped a long time ago.
But we only freed them... not saved them from war if they decide to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors and surgeons in war, but we are definitely not.
That&#39;s it.
And every day there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn&#39;t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a simple human plea is enough to free captives.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained a lot of authority and even trust among the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring parties?
Difficult question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname &quot;crazy general with steel balls&quot;.
It doesn&#39;t offend me.
And maybe that describes the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officer Corps, I had gained some authority earlier.
I never cheat, I never cheat and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or that of Donetsk or Luhansk.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they are being tortured and killed.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, I was even captured during a prisoner exchange... this job can mean the end for me at any time... I don&#39;t have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long pause)... both Ukrainians and separatists resort to torturing prisoners during interrogations.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
They take place only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information about the Ukrainian army also executing prisoners.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian military is doing anything similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that&#39;s what they say.
They don&#39;t want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to the death.
As we say - they ate them up to their throats.
By the way, people also expressed the same dreams and aspirations on the Maidan.
And now I will speculate a little: Russia supports the separatists, and the West, on the other hand, supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other, on the contrary, to be small.
Even this sentence of mine hides an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how does one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler, appear to you?
Whenever I cross the war front line, I am unarmed and show my open arms to soldiers or armed men.
And both sides of those two or three hundred meters always have me in sight or in the optical sight.
I can clearly see the faces of the people aiming at me every time... and they can pull the trigger of their guns at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, then only as a small province in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he talks about it all the time and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding that has arisen.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a discussion show on Ukrainian television, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, clueless and tired &quot;leader&quot; who would do best if he left quickly.
I always get scared at least five times during the three hundred meter walk.
So why should I hide my opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: In your opinion, is he involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians nickname Yatsenyuk &quot;Rabbit&quot;.
And in the eyes of Ukrainians, the rabbit is not an animal to be feared or to have respect and authority among others.
His behavior directly copies that of a rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister he has no right to cry in parliament in war, to beg him, to play his intrigues with him, to threaten to resign... he has to run the country, administer it and protect it in time of war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest for tearful emotions.
After all, he is the first minister of Ukraine.
And Yaceňuk?
She acts like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy Failed to Save Sales
Sylvester Stallone&#39;s The Expendables 3 returned less than $30 million from a $90 million budget in the US, and Sin City: The Woman I&#39;d Kill For only returned $12 million from a $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz&#39;s Sex Tape grossed only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, and children&#39;s films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were disappointing at the box office.
According to film critic Robbie Collin&#39;s article in the Telegraph, when it comes to children&#39;s films, their very quality is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the &quot;worst&quot; year for children&#39;s movies and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere &quot;functional&quot; sequel.
When it comes to movies aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem isn&#39;t necessarily the quality of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings for summer movies opening in at least 2,000 theaters between Memorial Day and July 20 in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account both audiences and film critics, suggest that this year&#39;s crop of films is of similar quality to last year&#39;s hits.
According to some commentators, a change in the attitude of viewers and the increased popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney&#39;s adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: &quot;I think times are changing.&quot;
We have to accept that and not try to chase after what has already been.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood blockbusters, Netflix&#39;s profit from Internet services reached $1.2 billion, which is almost twice as much as last year&#39;s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too heavily on comic book rights and predicted the &quot;collapse&quot; of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators claim there may be something to his doomsday prediction.
With the release of potential big box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Minions and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply &quot;cyclical.&quot; He told the Hollywood Reporter, &quot;Next summer is going to be the summer of the biggest box office hits in history, and nobody&#39;s going to worry about sales.&quot;
The DPRK threatens Seoul again, launched another short-range missile
North Korea fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul announced.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparation for an invasion.
Chagang province is located in the northwest of the DPRK near the border with China.
According to the DPA agency, the spokesman of the South Korean Ministry of Defense said that the missiles were fired from a place in the northwest of the DPRK and flew to a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently launched a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military sources.
An underground launch pad for Scud missiles is said to be located in the province.
It is another in a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in an anti-NATO march.
And on Sunday, around 150 people turned up at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough monitored the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists have been airlifted to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking at Govetts Leap in Blackheath after midday on Sunday.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police around eight o&#39;clock in the evening.
A search party including local police and a rescue team was dispatched and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11pm.
The girl hurt her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The police stayed with them overnight and they were picked up on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was due to Vašíček
It was the 23-year-old forward who could have decided, but he failed in the two biggest chances.
A close-range shot three minutes before the end called for a goal, but it ended up on Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoň instead of in the net.
I had it on my leg, I have to give chances like that.
I&#39;m angry with myself,&quot; Vašíček poured ashes on his head.
&quot;I probably should have put it higher under the lid, it slipped a bit,&quot; he mused.
Sigma&#39;s defense did not allow Opava much, the exception was Mikul&#39;s attack from the 11th minute, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanáci started to press, but the defending home team did not let them have chances in the block and Květoň caught the shots from a distance.
We compared each other for fifteen minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava only threatened us from standard situations.
But Vašíček didn&#39;t convert the open chance, so it ended 0:0,&quot; Hanák&#39;s coach Leoš Kalvoda regretted.
Opava also took a point due to the absences in the lineup, where, in addition to the injured pair, Petr Vavřík and three-goal scorer Petr Ševčík, who are visiting Silesia from Sigma, were also missing.
Contrary to her previous policy, she did not allow them to board.
Substitutes deserve a discharge.
&quot;Sigma looked more football-like, but we didn&#39;t let them do anything except for one set piece,&quot; said Slezan&#39;s coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and combativeness on display.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us,&quot; he added.
The draw took Sigma to four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club, Josef Lébr, who after the defeat with Znojmo made his million dollar deposit conditional on diametrically different performances in the next matches.
&quot;We were aware of Mr. Lébr&#39;s warning, so there can be no question of the boys not wanting to fight,&quot; observed Kalvoda, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Vašiček: &quot;I believe that it will come and when he scores a goal, it will start to fall for him .
But after the first hit, I will immediately replace him so that he can save goals for the next matches,&quot; laughed Kalvoda.
Al Pacino thrilled Venice twice.
The film festival is otherwise going through a crisis
After the great enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became a serious contender for the Golden Lion, the following days gave the impression that interest in the 71st edition of the Venice festival had waned somewhat.
Either because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films for the audience, such as the documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s Through the Eyes of Silence and other films with social themes from American 99 homes after Iranian Short stories, in short, empty seats remained in cinemas.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been besieged by such crowds as in the past, and it is said that it is no longer a problem to get a place in the hotel at the last minute.
The crisis is more talked about in Italy than anywhere else, and it is not surprising that it has also affected such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans were eager to get autographs from comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully took on dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In the out-of-competition Enlightenment, directed by Oscar-winner Barry Levison based on Philip Roth&#39;s novel, the 74-year-old Pacino has a role close to his heart: an actor on the cusp of fame suffering from late-career and personal-life depression.
But seeing him the next day as a geeky country-town hardware store owner in David Gordon Green&#39;s Manglehorn was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not miss him - but does an artist of Pacino&#39;s caliber still need an award?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian audience in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country where his grandparents come from.
Points for the Italians
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film to receive a standing ovation after Birdman.
In it, the Calabrian branch of the mafia is viewed from the perspective of family relationships between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director was able to match all the prerequisites for a good film: quality script, camera, music and actors.
He also caught the attention of the chamber psychothriller Hungary Hearts, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost destroys her own child with her misguided anxiety.
On the contrary, neither Ransom for Glory nor 3 Hearts received a warm reception from the French competition films, both works clinging to the traditional model of consumer films that rely on the popularity of the actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, i.e. Birdman and Black Souls, are not enough for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival&#39;s films tend to have depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich&#39;s new film She&#39;s Funny That Way, a funny comedy shown in Venice out of competition and shot in the style of American frolics of the 1940s, managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
The police caught four producers of meth in Prague, they were transporting the drugs from Poland
&quot;In the past few days, detectives arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who manufactured and sold the drug meth in Prague 9 from last November until this August,&quot; said police spokeswoman Jana Rösslerová.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlářské Street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who figured in the group as a buyer of drugs in Poland and a seller of doses.
The following day, the detectives detained another member of the group, a thirty-seven-year-old man, based on the prior consent of the public prosecutor.
The last of the four was caught by the police in the early hours of Wednesday, August 20, in the premises of the Malešické incinerator,&quot; the spokeswoman described.
The woman received a third of the drug for transporting the drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of activity.
He produced meth in a workshop in the Letenské area, in a garden house in Horoměřice, in an apartment in Koněvova Street and in other places in Prague 9, procured various tools and chemicals needed for its production, and arranged for the transportation of drugs containing pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
Next, he weighed the produced drug, divided it into plastic bags and then sold the meth.
A twenty-five-year-old woman, who has not yet been punished, helped him with the transportation of drugs from Poland or selling them to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the produced drug,&quot; added Rösslerová.
On the basis of the judge&#39;s order, the detectives also conducted several house searches, where they seized the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salary bags, syringes, tubes and other tools and objects that, according to experts, can be considered as complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
&quot;From the available records, the police found out that the main organizer had been convicted of property crimes a total of seven times since 1995, the woman was not convicted,&quot; the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was given a suspended sentence in 2006 for the crime of sexual abuse, and the thirty-seven-year-old auto mechanic, who is being prosecuted at large, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even for him, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing the crime of illegal production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator finally submitted to the public prosecutor a proposal for the imposition of detention, where the judge ultimately placed them,&quot; said the spokeswoman.
The fourth accused, a thirty-seven-year-old recidivist, ended up free.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as in the case of the other accused.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Within its other products, Ferrari offers very interesting things at very &quot;interesting&quot; prices.
A good example is a chess made by hand in Italy with a board size of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer gets a set of wooden figures painted in black and red, stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fiber.
It probably won&#39;t surprise anyone that instead of a classic horseman, the players have a prancing horse figure at their disposal.
If chess doesn&#39;t seem like a valuable enough gift, there&#39;s also a Ferrari 500 F2 model built (by hand, of course) in 1:1.8 scale.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Canceling gymnasiums and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics also show that high school graduates have good employment.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In the last fortnight, big preparations have been going on in the schools.
Most of them are routine matters, such as carrying flower pots from summer storage back into classrooms and puffing on chalk.
At the Hořice grammar school, they will have a little more frmol.
A few days before the start of the season, they look for furniture, computers and other technical equipment as well as literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year high school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by entering it into the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education and Culture.
&quot;French socialists should shut up and fix France,&quot; says a key ally of Francois Hollande
Valls is calling on the deeply fragmented left to &quot;show its support&quot; for the embattled Socialist president, whose new division of functions has not met with the approval of the majority of French people.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
&quot;Our duty is to stand by his side,&quot; he said to applause.
In a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted his government would not challenge France&#39;s controversial 35-hour working week, despite heated arguments from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who suggested earlier in the week that the rules should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain &quot;cohesive&quot; with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the justice minister, drew a line across the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs where she criticized the Socialist Party for making &quot;the French lose faith in the future&quot; because of it.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed off the constant infighting among the Socialists, saying she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and so is Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not even last until the end of the summer.
&quot;And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter,&quot; Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party&#39;s call to dissolve Parliament, saying she believed it could win the party a snap election and that she was ready to lead the country.
France&#39;s ruling party suffered a defeat in March&#39;s local elections, and in May the extreme conservative right won the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the weekly Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande&#39;s term in office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French will soon run out of patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
&quot;It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion has to think that the situation is changing,&quot; he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague until the elections
Changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new management of the capital.
More arcades will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
Walking dogs will not be restricted either.
Prague will not have time to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the council before the October elections.
&quot;Additionally, the decision on changes should not be made by the current city management, whose mandate ends in a few weeks,&quot; said councilor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls, for example Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling across the board in recent weeks.
But the casinos will not disappear, the gambling ordinance will not be changed yet.
It is the task of the new city management after the elections.
Now we wouldn&#39;t even be able to do it technically due to, for example, deadlines for submitting comments and the like,&quot; Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a blanket ban on gambling is being prepared on the day of the municipal elections in the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
Currently, gambling is prohibited in, for example, Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not be changed in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1 complains about this, as it has already sent the municipality a proposal of places that it would like to add to the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians are also not wanted by Praha 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The city has been preparing the ordinance regulating dog walking for several months, but it is not finalized yet.
The location of playhouses and the issue of busking are dealt with by city ordinances.
They can only be issued or edited by the capital city council.
Town halls have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he put victory within reach of the proponents of Scottish independence
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost put on billboards across Scotland the question of whether Scots want to be rich.
But you won&#39;t win the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you win their respect by threatening them.
New Testament morality is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots are far more inclined to drive the moneychangers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The leader of the Scottish Nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this well, which is why he repeatedly asked his opponent, the unionist Darling, in a televised debate whether he was willing to respect the &quot;sovereign will of the Scottish people&quot; if the Scottish electorate voted for independence and start supporting a single currency for Scotland and for England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he grimaced into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support a Scottish mandate.
However, the discussion about what kind of currency Scotland will have has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defense of the public health service, which citizens have for free.
Darling supported the London bankers on the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not object to the privatization of health care.
By doing so, as Salmond put it, he &quot;climbed into bed with the Tories&quot;.
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician to be in.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Tories.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to the voters, but to the association of &quot;bosses&quot;, the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron&#39;s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
This makes Cameron look like a cowardly absentee homebody.
The Scots would respect him if he came to debate the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland can be a &quot;successful independent country&quot;.
Alistair Darling can&#39;t say such a thing, it almost physically hurts him.
What it conveys is clear: Scots are not to jump around and have to accept what is.
The longest year has 10 months.
A pessimistic start to school according to Miloš Urban
Illustration for the story The Longest Year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week when we didn&#39;t go anywhere and we just hung out and floated with Grandma Summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes when you could get them from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, already the fiftieth, whizzing by bike up past the Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun caressed the back and shoulders, patted the rays goodbye.
Mild nervousness in the evening, still in holiday mode, sleep until half past eleven, will be worse in a week, moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at half past seven in the morning.
Monday will come.
Most of the time it doesn&#39;t rain, on the contrary, summer sneers maliciously in front of the school.
To creep up to the patch in the ghostly light and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there is that school, ZDŠ A.
Zápotocký with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, the boys taller, the girls bustier.
There are goons over there, avoid them, it&#39;s interesting how they infallibly stick together and how quickly they&#39;re here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came screaming are now laughing hysterically at something, I guess something changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is the same with me.
And the new freshmen, some nervous and others excited, why are they climbing here at all?
Because they have to, the educational war they must.
So inside, the cool dampness of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the annoyed janitor with the mop, unfortunately still the same one who supposedly lends the student the key to the tin cabinet where textbooks can be kept and of which there are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the changing rooms remains in the memory, it is not happening now, it is well ventilated, but it will be worse in a week.
Just the thought of it makes my stomach churn and my head ache.
A head that is even harder to grasp the curriculum of mathematics, that diabolical game for the chosen ones, among whom I am not and never will be.
Those threes and fours again, God forbid the fives, hide from the exam, fit into the bench and sublimate, be there and not be, exist only as a name in the classroom and for now dream stories about nicer girls and prettier buildings, about antennas into space, where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone, and does not step on anyone&#39;s leg.
The longest year has ten months.
And it&#39;s only the first day, now like years ago.
She let her born daughters die.
She faces an exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet cubicle at the bus station in Jihlava.
She gave birth to a baby girl without anyone else&#39;s help. After cutting the umbilical cord, she wrapped it in a prepared blanket, hid it under her jacket, and carried it to the road feeder, where she deposited it in the bushes located a few tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It probably came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I had to go to the toilet on the bus, and I gave birth there.
She was born alive, she was looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the scissors that I brought to school,&quot; the defendant described, adding that she was ashamed of the pregnancy.
&quot;The next day, she returned to the place, put the child&#39;s body in a backpack and took it away, took the body out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother&#39;s house in Havlíčková Brod,&quot; the lawsuit states, stating that she is not completely obvious when the death of the newborn occurred.
It could be in tens of minutes, but also several hours after birth, by suffocation when covered with a blanket or when put under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an untied umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated the following spring.
In the unspecified period from February to April 12, when the child&#39;s corpse was found by random witnesses under the bushes near a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, the woman secretly gave birth again.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without checking whether it was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord that was wrapped around the neck, she put the baby in several plastic packages including a plastic bag and left him in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, together with his partner at the time, they took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend turned her in
The father of both children was the defendant&#39;s boyfriend, who allegedly did not know about his partner&#39;s pregnancies.
Even for that reason, he is not standing before the court, he was only punished for an offense against the law on funerals.
He was also the one who later contacted the police.
I don&#39;t like that he is not punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was not correct, but it seemed human at the time,&quot; the defendant, who allegedly submitted to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him, did not hide her indignation.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke relatively calmly.
Tears came to her eyes only when she spoke about her relationship with her parents, from whom she herself left after reaching adulthood.
She said she didn&#39;t want to kill
&quot;They come to visit me every 14 days, they do absolutely everything for me, even though I know I don&#39;t deserve it,&quot; she sobbed.
I didn&#39;t buy accessories because I didn&#39;t want children, I felt young.
I kept wanting to put him in the baby box, but I don&#39;t know what happened that I didn&#39;t.
I can&#39;t explain that to you,&quot; she answered the judge&#39;s question.
However, she denied that she acted with forethought and intent to kill the newborn.
In addition, according to her claim, the second child was stillborn.
Even during pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
However, I limited it.
And she didn&#39;t drink hard.
I also cut down on smoking,&quot; she said.
Although her pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed to everyone, even on repeated questions, that she had health problems, that she was waterlogged.
And that too my friend.
The main trial will continue at the Hradec Králové court on Tuesday with the testimony of forensic experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened with a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is closing in on a $3 billion buyout of Prestige Cruise
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the world&#39;s third-largest cruise operator, has advanced negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc., according to sources familiar with the matter. for approximately three billion dollars.
The deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion that rivals bigger rivals Royal Carrebian Cruises Ltd ( RCL.N ) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N ) access to Prestige Cruises&#39; luxury cruise ships and wealthy clientele.
The deal could be made public as early as this week, the source said on Sunday, but cautioned that the talks still may not be successful.
Prestige Cruises&#39; owner, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises officials did not respond to requests for comment, while an Apollo spokesman declined to comment on the situation.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships sailing in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company&#39;s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies are competing to become these customers&#39; preferred cruise choice.
Prestige Cruises registered an initial public offering with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007, when the deal was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with cruise operator Genting Bhd ( GENT.KL ), a consortium of leisure and casino businesses controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting owned 28%, Apollo 20% and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8%, according to a regulatory filing at the end of June.
According to registration filings, the initial public offerings of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise combined account for 82% of North American passenger volume.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after the vote decision
A group of people loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Sunday approved only two of three candidates to run in Hong Kong&#39;s 2017 election.
All candidates must first win the support of a nominating committee, which is likely to be made up of members loyal to Beijing.
The decision makes it nearly impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democracy activists to renew their pledge to cripple Hong Kong&#39;s financial center with &quot;Occupy Central&quot; protests.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major source of tension, with Chinese leaders worried that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China&#39;s official authority in Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in the Special Administrative Region and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city&#39;s business district and occupied it.
The press conference at which Premier Li will speak is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Zhang Ronghsun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to open &#39;state sovereignty&#39; talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the &quot;state sovereignty&quot; of the breakaway regions, according to a Russian newspaper account of the events.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin&#39;s remarks did not mean that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed to give the Russian-speaking region the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin&#39;s call for the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with the apparent strategy he has followed since the unrest broke out five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant de facto independence to the newly-proclaimed Novorossivka so that it can reconcile with the West could connect with Russia.
In an interview with state-run Channel One, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to retake the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine&#39;s Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have dubbed the recently seized territory &quot;Novoruska&quot; or &quot;New Russia,&quot; a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
Russia&#39;s Itar-Tass news agency published Putin&#39;s words that anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon is a &quot;prisoner of illusions&quot; as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns ahead of October 26 parliamentary elections while government troops attack civilians in areas controlled by separatists.
&quot;For the sake of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of southeastern Ukraine,&quot; he declared.
Peskov said Putin&#39;s allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy that has been in talks with Kiev&#39;s leadership for months and is meant to ease concerns in Russian-speaking regions about threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, &quot;because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.&quot;
The Kremlin spokesman&#39;s move, which was to correct a &quot;misinterpretation&quot; of Putin&#39;s remarks, underscored the Russian leadership&#39;s approach to dealing with the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population of two million are ethnic Russian.
Moscow would also have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and opinion polls conducted even before the conflict showed broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which Russian diplomats have negotiated in international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade deals and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia&#39;s main naval fleet, a maritime trading base and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia&#39;s Rostov and Crimea are also a hub of mines, factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military.
During his inauguration speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and linguistic status.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin&#39;s latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed another advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously quiet region along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have seized control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security officials fear it is a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This precipitated a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical plants of 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Speaking at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, Poroshenko called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
&quot;We are approaching the point of no return,&quot; Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - the leaders call for the adoption of additional sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine&#39;s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to supported the besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the scandal with the exposed photos
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who allegedly stole intimate photos of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in the biggest celebrity photo hack scandal yet.
The hacker claims to have sixty nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko have reportedly also become public due to the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine: &quot;It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It&#39;s a shame that personal information can be stolen and made public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, told the online paper that the hack was &quot;shameless&quot; and those who were targeted &quot;feel humiliated,&quot; according to reporters.
The hacker is believed to have obtained thirty photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of her topless lounging by the pool.
For example, Palmer acted in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and Sucker Punch thriller actress Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
A rep for Lawrence told TMZ, &quot;This is a clear violation of privacy.&quot;
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter: &quot;Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.&quot;
Legally speaking, posting stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigma football players enjoyed Lébra, even without a win
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that co-owner of Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week seems to be a thing of the past.
Even though Opava brought only a point for a goalless draw.
With their commitment and combativeness, they won the club boss a little favor after all.
Money for salaries could soon come to the club.
&quot;I&#39;ll keep one more match, as I talked about last week, but I&#39;m much more optimistic,&quot; Lébr confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma didn&#39;t win, the players convinced him with their improved performance.
The fight and commitment we played with especially in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I can forgive him not winning.
If we had played like that since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we would not have lost yet,&quot; Lébr thinks.
Sigma in Opava withstood the initial pressure of the home team, then leveled the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvod&#39;s players reached out, but did not reach their goals, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
We lacked only one converted chance to be completely satisfied,&quot; said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the players&#39; attitude was caused only by his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
Either from my side, from the coach&#39;s side, or from the fans,&quot; said Lébr.
Sigma has to reckon with the pressure
The players did not want to comment much on the events of last week after the match in Opava.
I try to put these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it,&quot; young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
The forward Václav Vašíček, who did not convert Sigma&#39;s biggest opportunity in Saturday&#39;s match, left the question about Lébr&#39;s statement from last week completely uncommented.
After all, he talked a little about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
Everyone wants to pull one out on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and drive ass, it will work,&quot; he said.
They took the warning to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was quite difficult.
But I think the guys realized that, and today it was clear that they took Mr. Lébre&#39;s warning to heart.
Although even before it wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t want to fight and flunked it,&quot; said the coach from Olomouc.
It was similar to today for the first fifteen minutes.
It took us a while to come to grips with the hardness and realize what the second league is all about.
That it&#39;s not just about football skills, but mainly about the combativeness,&quot; said Kalvoda.
We can only hope that in the next matches it will work for Sigma from the beginning.
&quot;I would very much like to believe it,&quot; he added.
