The big comeback of the Czech underdog is coming.
Pavel Francouz was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the substitutes&#39; bench and could soon be in goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Pilsen and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
He was replaced exactly halfway through the game with Vegas, and since then he has not appeared on NHL rinks.
The incident happened when the experienced goalkeeper was moving from one stick to another.
&quot;Pavel Francouz will be out approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury,&quot; the Denver outfit announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL ended up being extended to more than two months.
He was recalled from the farm on Sunday morning US time, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he scored 94.5% of saves.
The student of Pilsen hockey finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and did not play a single game in the pandemic-shortened year.
In the NHL, &quot;Francík&quot; caught 36 games, his save success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a mask on Camille on the Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain&#39;s Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles also published his wishes, using a photo of him helping his wife Camille put on a mask at the races.
The British news station BBC reported about it on its website.
They send wishes to friends, colleagues and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki summer dress and Princess Charlotte also wears a dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, like Princes George and Louis, is wearing shorts and a collared T-shirt.
William and Kate did not say who took the photo, nor is it clear when exactly it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed on a bale of straw in front of a woodpile at their country home in Norfolk for a photo intended as a Christmas card.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them at the Ascot races in June.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a veil over his face, helps Camille put on her veil, which is color coordinated with the light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminal investigators in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns by Slavia Prague for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
The efotbal.cz server informed about it, saying that it got access to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, stated that the Red and Whites did not commit any corrupt behavior.
The server has published a transcript of the police wiretapping, in which Slavia&#39;s former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer, figures mainly.
According to the file, the former influential official of the Red and Whites was in frequent contact with both Berber and the former sports director of the then second division Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminal investigators allegedly worked with the information that Slavia had promised Berbra a financial reward if he won the title.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is not clear from the file whether the police are still dealing with this information.
Tvrdík denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in illegal behavior, we have never sought to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial compensation in this regard,&quot; Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
In the wiretaps, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some dark-skinned former Slavia players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of alleged match-fixing by referees was triggered last year in mid-October by a police intervention at several locations, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The most senior figure in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, Rogoz, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are cold war larping.
The cannons will be new, but basically of a worse type (the gunners have to carry cartridges from an armored cabin by hand without a cover).
The cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, it was already possible to get rid of the Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat - decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - very small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don&#39;t have them at all (but we manufacture and export them abroad)
Air defense: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I have a hunting ground right next to the city.
Nutria were coming out of the river and damaging the crops, so I sat down there.
As I was coming, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn&#39;t want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn&#39;t notice me.
I hoped he would leave before anything came up, but of course the fox went after a while.
I let her come to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost pissed himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
By the time I got off my seat, it was a mess.
That is Even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it&#39;s not a war, it would have to be the interplay of a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermal imager, which almost everyone has today.
So put your expensive things in a visible place in a sleeping bag by your feet and you should be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamáček.
The Interior obtained respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, which is responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their procurement in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day the amounts for respirators differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities behaved economically?
And why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations went through), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory military service.
We don&#39;t even have large stores of technology that the trained could take up, we don&#39;t actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is getting more and more complicated, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where mass guerillas are going to lead and it&#39;s a definite necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in a conflict of such a scale and intensity that guerrillas will no longer be relevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for that.
mainly we don&#39;t have an individual skill.
That&#39;s not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them act like they have it.
Then such a situation arises that you watch as a guy who didn&#39;t hit an empty net 2 minutes ago, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself &quot;what do you think is going to happen now?&quot;.
Well, of course they vote for him like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this &quot;trick the defender&quot; skill is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised when I see that our attacker was able to beat one of the opponent&#39;s players.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the onslaught in hospitals will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation, as we know: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity acquired by previously experiencing the disease helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the positive side also entered the covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third, and it is possible to treat it at home.
And it should soon be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports an 85 percent success rate from the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As mentioned, Merck&#39;s molnupiravir will be the first to reach domestic patients.
The company finished first on the tape also because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic with the aim of finding a suitable treatment for a viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
Often overlooked in this research is that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to saying &quot;how our beaks grew&quot;.
See you do a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, the majority will tell you no.
In the West they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They are afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing your job and being lynched by the media.
Then it looks good in the surveys, the west is good, the east is bad.
But they find out what people really think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20% according to the survey.
We even know that there are three objects in Czech and they are completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, so all objects are exactly the same.
One is the Brdy Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or for the speed of warhead deployment due to its more western location.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only warheads were kept, not entire rockets, as they say.
If this weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit would come and pick up this warhead and mount it on some sort of carrier.
Apart from the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a gypsy classmate, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, made good jokes, often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often came and wanted to explain something, he was rarely absent, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn&#39;t steal snacks or phones, he was cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in nature, he did various monkey farms, but he was cool, maybe never a jerk.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, different classes.
Shortly after that, they beat up the teacher, the police often dealt with something there, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an advertisement (old things, something I don&#39;t need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had the money, they didn&#39;t try to make any attempts to stretch me on the price, communication was calm.
I even sold a car this way, the guy called a month later to say that he had already transferred it to himself..
I say myself that I am not a racist, I don&#39;t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, function, don&#39;t beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes, reaches out, clears out apartments and houses, has only a mess around him, causes problems... it doesn&#39;t matter what color he is, but it will bother me.
I don&#39;t have a problem with African migrants if they join us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don&#39;t care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
&quot;The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot,&quot; Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian medical rescuers, told Práv.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was taking the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov, and for reasons not yet determined, drove off in the opposite direction at a bend.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on its roof outside the roadway, described the accident by South Bohemian Police spokesperson Štěpánka Schwarzová.
The young Peugeot driver suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After he was rescued, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital in a stable condition, stated paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys trading cards.
&quot;Usually it can be tens of dollars, let&#39;s say from ten dollars upwards, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post is often free,&quot; the collector adds.
Since October, ordering small parcels has become slightly more expensive, and he now has to add VAT and provide the post office with data for customs procedures.
He receives an email saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the information about the shipment, and if the merchant did not already include VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not take care of the customs procedure himself, the carrier&#39;s remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lukáš Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click a checkbox or two, put in two attachments and I&#39;m done.
For me, it&#39;s usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
However, not all shipments manage to be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of parcels received from abroad at the international post office in Prague dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to Česká pošta, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls to supply the data that is needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels at the international post office that we need to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed, and filled it in on time, then we would be about halfway here, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Solving inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and its further growth is expected.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
For example, in Poland we see a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where this is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, I think it&#39;s inevitable that people won&#39;t be able to afford basic things, especially energy.
How much did you get for example added (who is an employee)?
They gave me a 2% increase in gross this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while employed.
Would someone be able to explain to me why demonstrably convicted rapists are sent behind bars for only 6 months?
I just don&#39;t understand how the court can send such an animal behind bars for only 6 months only to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will be traumatized for several years, it will negatively affect his/her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention that the rape victim may never recover from it either.
Won&#39;t this also deter potential future reporting of rape victims?
A man from Hrob &quot;burned&quot; his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from Hrob inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant had been issued.
He called them to her himself.
But he went about it in a detour.
He first approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged &quot;robber&quot; told them that he had invented everything so that the officers would come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted advice from the police officers on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, a national search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
The case is therefore handled by the PČR.
Honest question for people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer ethnically or culturally Slavic, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it&#39;s a shame that Churchill didn&#39;t manage to secure the liberation of Prague from the USA :&#39;)
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s quite questionable whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially bring benefits.
I personally would not consider such a case as true faith.
I can&#39;t agree with Pascal here, there are approximately ten thousand different religions in the world, if I&#39;m not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite likely that in any of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
However, even in the Ten Commandments it is stated that there is no other god but Yahweh.
So in that case, wouldn&#39;t it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god at all than to risk choosing wrongly out of thousands of gods and the one real god I just missed sending me to hell or some such place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent enlistment in the reserves.
I suspect the Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the Defense University.
We can talk like this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly floundering, companies are poaching in schools, and there is a kind of blending, where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interweaving should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or even a Mongolian invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something set in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Well please, man.
All it takes is one election in the USA to screw up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to shit.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that they only need to show their backs and they will take what they want.
The only thing that works as a guarantor of independence in the long term is an army armed to the teeth and a population that knows how to control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot a remote-controlled device, so why not?
We don&#39;t need border fortifications, that&#39;s a fart these days, but a hot-headed teenager behind the stick of a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you unwrapping presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly your home is full of boxes and fillings?
This &quot;waste&quot; is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes was created.
And not only at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
By agreement, anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the participating store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overfilled blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as packaging cardboard has become more expensive by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a producer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are brought to Popůvek u Brno by individuals who accumulate them at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz application does not only show collection points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, old electronics, batteries, light sources, bulky waste, etc.).
All garbage can thus end up in the right place, and reusable things can find a second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such places.
&quot;Collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find a use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily,&quot; adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the by the authors of the application from the association Ukliďme Česko.
I rather feel bad that nowadays technology is so simple and foolproof that kids who use a computer or phone play games on it but don&#39;t learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple&#39;s photo applications, or actually mobile phones in general, simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Feel free to let them use technology from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let&#39;s rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron laid out the priorities for France&#39;s EU presidency - starting in January - over the weekend, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency&#39;s logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they could not be covered in six months.
However, French politicians like it that way and so do the voters.
Macron&#39;s supporters of the straddle between the right and the left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write &quot;one history of Europe&quot; and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed to criticize that Macron is engaged in pro-European propaganda and is rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
Far-right French presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is going around France right now arguing that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler in World War II, wasn&#39;t so bad, and he&#39;s having quite a bit of success with the French.
Let&#39;s try to take Macron&#39;s idea for a history book seriously and not look at what&#39;s happening in France.
Wouldn&#39;t it be needed?
Students in European countries tend to learn history as an us versus them story and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don&#39;t have an enlightened cantor, they won&#39;t learn what the wider context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech &quot;Mice&quot; did not win.
The story, which goes back to the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995, also won awards for direction and for best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year&#39;s Karlovy Vary festival, he was on the top of the audience list.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the film Father.
I am not very young, I am not very healthy/fit and I am not vaccinated.
It was like &quot;having the flu/being sick&quot; I had diarrhea for a few days and didn&#39;t really want to smoke...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don&#39;t have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I&#39;m not saying that everyone feels this way)

Those who stayed and those who left know too little about each other to make a living together.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers change
From Sunday, trains will start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the change of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts running instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time will be adjusted, or even their route slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets already in the fall.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6,783 passenger transport connections per day, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections, the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
The carrier will send other new trains to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices starting next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the introduction of the R23 line Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier here will replace České dráhy after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
RegioJet will make a total of 16 daily connections on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier tried to keep the running times of its long-distance trains as similar as possible despite the planned shutdown works.
The operation of Arrival trains and other carriers should continue without major changes.
The carrier will also change on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers in Českolipsk, for example, where Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform railway fare for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning the other side&#39;s point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, how they were dying.
I have never in my life heard a teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
Nobody even tells you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, murdered them, while they were killing each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern ones.
I haven&#39;t come across anyone deliberately withholding facts, but I&#39;ve heard it happen before and I think it&#39;s a problem, I&#39;m not denying that (in Japan, for example, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today&#39;s point of view, without understanding.
History doesn&#39;t care about anyone&#39;s feelings, it just is what it is, and I think it&#39;s a fatal mistake to judge without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this.
By the way, speaking of the southern states, yes, the confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slaveholder and there were a lot of things they were against too.
I wouldn&#39;t compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, moreover, our point of view doesn&#39;t exist with them (there was also a video on YT where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was appalling at some universities, the students were quite radicalized and the schools supported them many times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there are also in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has long since achieved what it should have and it is no longer about the same thing, it has become radicalized.
Currently, those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact are labeled as feminists, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and it leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
Anyway, in conclusion, I have also not encountered anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
Rather, I encountered a bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don&#39;t like it here, but because I think it&#39;s completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn&#39;t do on my own?
In addition, I generally consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary from the point of view of any personal identity.
If something connects me with people, it&#39;s interests, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not religious, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is a very nice guy, his sermons are more about theology than politics, but then he always makes some joke about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in reality they were born out of Catholicism and are effectively Catholics without a Pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to Hussite services because it&#39;s very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael&#39;s Church in Dominikánské náměstí belongs to the Dominicans, and they even celebrate mass in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the scouts did not go to Vienna for him either this time, they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal - Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
They took it at the border last year as well.
The Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we take part in with the troop every year, I&#39;m really looking forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But scouts usually go to Vienna by train for him.
Nothing has changed regarding the delivery of flambé in the Czech Republic.
The scouts traditionally set off with the Bethlehem light first by train to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent delivery of the light will be taken care of on Saturday, December 18 by scout couriers who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the light from them at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame across the Czech Republic even where the tracks do not lead.
This year too, Scouts must follow the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It&#39;s the same as last year.
We advise both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to of course wear masks, try to keep the distance, there should be as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, simply to behave in a way that makes it as safe as possible, described Zuzana Hrbková, the spokeswoman for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light, which travels across Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, the light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, male and female scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event relies on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don&#39;t have an economic education, so I don&#39;t know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don&#39;t think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), healthcare and education use the money properly, I just don&#39;t understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - an unnecessary product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the &quot;natural life of the company&quot;.
I myself work in a factory where there are a million notices in the corridors &quot;xy financed/co-financed by the xy project&quot; and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to x people, this is the retardation of development when this company hangs on and takes orders/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it&#39;s terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that Internet ads don&#39;t move me, but then I catch myself that they have influenced me too - it&#39;s just so overwhelming that you can&#39;t always resist it.
It is also for this reason that I support the radical voices in the European Parliament who currently want to put a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It&#39;s all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban those internets.
I have the feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mainly in point 1):
1. &quot;I won&#39;t believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I&#39;m not a sheep after all, but I&#39;d rather believe something that&#39;s less likely, it doesn&#39;t make much sense, but it&#39;s important that I have my own original opinion that I&#39;ll claim is critical thought&quot;
2. &quot;I won&#39;t believe everything the media says after all&quot;
3. &quot;I don&#39;t trust politicians&quot;
Televisions have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them are premiering this year
Los Angeles - Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the Christmas movie trend, and this year they will present a record-breaking more than two hundred to their audiences.
It was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been popular with audiences in recent years and has significantly increased viewership, which is why more and more of these films are being produced.
Four times more Christmas movies were made this year than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
At the same time, the IMDb database included in its total only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
Fairy tales are particularly associated with this period in the Czech Republic, and the films Home Alone, Heavenly Love or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom of Christmas films only started in 2009, when the American cable TV station Hallmark came with a special film series, the BBC server reminded.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Countdown to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station started tuning its viewers for Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Competing channel Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix also contribute to the total.
&quot;In this magical season, the story doesn&#39;t really matter, what matters is that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it&#39;s snowing,&quot; Brandon Gray, author of the Christmas movie book I&#39;ll Be Home for Christmas Movies ( I&#39;ll be home for Christmas movies).
&quot;For the audience, it&#39;s a form of escapism and a way to at least feel a bit of peace for two hours in the midst of all the holiday craziness and the craziness of the world we&#39;ve been living in for the last few years,&quot; added Gray.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV always uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end there is some misunderstanding, which is resolved successfully and the two kiss.
That&#39;s the way it goes, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after the other, adds Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text for covid-19, he will not participate in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive test for covid-19 and will not participate in the last race of the season.
The Haas team will therefore send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack for a better position from the 20th place, which he achieved in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not participate in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin&#39;s teammate Mick Schumacher will take to the track from the last row, and Max Verstappen from the first, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a direct battle for the title.
According to the Haas team, Mazepin is relatively well and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine as he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety as the ultimate priority for all parties involved,&quot; her representatives told formula1.com.
Haas will not, and cannot, send a replacement driver to the race.
Any substitute would have to complete qualifying or rides in another part of the weekend.
The first competitor is not dealing with covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the just-ending season, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You can be locked up for this too.
And everyone will be robbed, the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhus.
§ 152 Spread of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activity or confiscation of property.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
c) if, by doing so, he violates an important obligation resulting from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him by law, or
d) if such an act causes serious injury to health.
(3) The offender shall be punished with imprisonment for three to ten years if he causes serious harm to the health of at least two persons or death by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to twelve years if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It&#39;s a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
&quot;I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn much at home,&quot; admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours on his work over six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by the Swarovski company.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
&quot;The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness,&quot; praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there is one more catch.
&quot;I&#39;m completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,&quot; admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost &quot;only&quot; 720,000 crowns.

The government approved sending up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help their Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested help from NATO countries, in connection with the actions of the Belarusian regime lasting several months, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamovo.
&quot;Currently, we have another suspicion of this variant reported in another child from Adamovo, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from ZŠ Adamov is not proven,&quot; said Ciupek.
In the week, six cases appeared in the region.
&quot;We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,&quot; said the director.
She added that they were two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
According to the director, three of them have mild symptoms, four are asymptomatic.
No one suspected Omikron traveled abroad
None of those mentioned have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor has there been any contact with anyone who resides abroad.
There is no connection with the water polo championship for any of the mentioned, said Ciupek.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously stated that the international water polo tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being examined.
There were also players from the Republic of South Africa on it, and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California to restrict gun sales
He wants to follow the example of Texas in banning abortion.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some guns in America&#39;s most populous state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial law against fetal heartbeat detection.
People would then be entitled to damages by suing anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom&#39;s announcement came in response to Friday&#39;s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the Texas abortion ban, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established the right to abortion across the U.S. until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it through the usual court process.
&quot;I am outraged by yesterday&#39;s (Friday) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to remain in place and greatly supported Texas&#39; maneuver to protect its law,&quot; the California governor said.
&quot;If states can now block federal court review of their laws, then California will use that power to protect lives,&quot; Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on a measure that would authorize members of the public to enforce a ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants &quot;private citizens&quot; to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages (over 220,000 CZK) and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, parts for &quot;ghost guns&quot; or kits for their production.
&quot;If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that&#39;s exactly what we should do,&quot; the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the manufacture and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge struck down the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a dissenting opinion to Friday&#39;s majority verdict, warned against expanding the given legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas&#39; abortion ban full immunity from judicial review, allowing abortion clinics to continue to sue select officials in the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it is gradually figured out what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are also improved, based on the results.
For example, a study on the effects of 4 doses is already being widely published in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a fivefold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it is still too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer&#39;s specifications promises to be up to 10 times more effective, should be on the market soon.

How can I legally watch Champions League online?
Do you know if there is any online service here in the Czech Republic that would allow me to watch the Champions League for a fee?
We have a Netbox at home and I pay for a Telly sports package for the Spanish and English football leagues.
However, this does not include the UEFA Champions League.
I think O2 offers the Champions League but I don&#39;t want to switch TV and internet providers.
Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting in violation of the law if it used the new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan regarding the drawing of 36 billion euros from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to go further and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies from countries violating the principles of the rule of law.
&quot;Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity,&quot; said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
&quot;Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices,&quot; added Ziobro.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stops its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable considering that the EU illegally denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobr&#39;s tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobr, Brussels is setting &quot;impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland.&quot;
Warsaw is facing &quot;a political dictate carried out by blackmail and an attempt to subvert the democratic decision of several million Poles,&quot; Ziobro also said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of such an EU, which is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the rule of the most powerful and the Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never make such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland&#39;s sovereignty would be limited.
&quot;We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony,&quot; he declared.
But to know it... Here at Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn&#39;t look for the other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it&#39;s true, in that narrow sector there were all the select, uncommon and specialty cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose free zone...
If I can avoid it, I don&#39;t even bother going to any market anymore, a sale, a sale, a gold shop on the square, maybe they don&#39;t have such a selection there, but they usually have everything I need and it&#39;s in some order, so I&#39;m done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a holiday.
And I don&#39;t really care anymore.
For two years I have watched the data being treated like manure here, most of the anti-vaccines are just a little more out of line than most of the pro-vaccinators.
Although rational discussion takes place at the professional level, only extreme opinions reach the public space.
Wall to wall all the time.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Disable everything, enable everything.
Colorful pies instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples to pears.
This is how this country is and we are like this.
But the fact that the methodology of data collection is different in the two countries is not addressed by anyone.
Phew, I&#39;m relieved.
Sorry for the outpouring and I wish you all a nice day.
I was punished with a wooden spoon in my childhood.
It was never about grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another &quot;tap&quot; she would only bring a wooden spoon and put it so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a couple of kicks on the ass (through my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a choice, in a way, to disobey and get it, or to improve and not be punished.
In the end, usually only a warning was enough for me to start listening.
System defense
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalist&#39;s question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him - whether it is a sacred document to which he swears and which he learns in school from an early age, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary , he was definitely leaning towards the first concept.
We once agreed in the constitution on the democratic rules of our life, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to be sparing with changes.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes is emerging more and more often among lawyers.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not foresee, for example the behavior of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be deliberate.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The constitution is, among other things, a kind of governing order consisting of individual rules that set the game rules for politicians.
We fear that power will be misused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn&#39;t choose, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a few-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder on children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
&quot;We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,&quot; Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University, told Novinkám.
The course tends to be much simpler, lighter, often occurs without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially recently,&quot; added Dominik.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the children&#39;s infectious diseases clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with the coronavirus have only recently been in the ARU.
According to the doctor, children with post-covid syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year.
&quot;Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia that requires a stay in a resuscitation bed,&quot; he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus in hospitals.
&quot;Currently, we have a child of several months and an adolescent age,&quot; said the primary.
He is happy, however, that no children have died from the coronavirus at the Children&#39;s Hospital of the National University Hospital in Brno.
According to the available data, six children between the ages of 0 and 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, a psychologist is an integral part of cooperation in a children&#39;s hospital – not just in the coronavirus ward.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, just as in adults, vaccination in children also mitigates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
&quot;That&#39;s why we recommend the application of the vaccination dose for children as well,&quot; added the doctor.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the calm zones are not that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in national parks outside the quiet zone (but don&#39;t climb over the fence into the nature reserve).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside of marked paths is not allowed anywhere, unless you have an exception (but of course outside of national parks it is not so closely monitored).
How does a conductor practice?
Music goes through my head, laughs Josef Kurfiřt.
He was weaned by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing practically the entire repertoire and works as a conductor not only in the F. Šalda Theater in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theater.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Krkonoše Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is creating the impression that the contagion is under control and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has embarked on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for its failure to stop the contagion, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports zero increase in infected people.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping in the fight against the coronavirus in many places, for example even in the worst-affected Italy.
How to perceive Beijing&#39;s willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey, don&#39;t you want an elephant?
I have it and it&#39;s great.
The wife is happy because she grazes the grass, washes the car with the trunk, the children play with it.
Well, just great.
If you want, I will sell you the elephant for 5,000.
Friend: yes, I&#39;ll slap myself, that will be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought it complains: dude, what did you sell it for an elephant????
The lawn is trampled, there is giant shit everywhere, the car has broken down, the children are afraid of him and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says: you talk badly about an elephant, you can&#39;t sell an elephant like that...
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
It still works at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won&#39;t be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will be successful.
I thought that too and it&#39;s quite possible.
I&#39;m not an expert in Czech, so maybe I&#39;m using words.
I&#39;m just assuming that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment &quot;Spanish oranges and tangerines&quot;, where it is clear that they are both from Spain, while with &quot;Spanish fruit and tangerines&quot; it is not clear that the tangerines are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the sentence reads &quot;all American forces&quot;, i.e. including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in that broad term and there is no need to further specify it for US forces.
But again, maybe I&#39;m just playing with words :D
Either way, it&#39;s a ridiculous request
An earthquake with a magnitude of five was recorded in Tokyo.
A 5.0-magnitude earthquake hit the Japanese capital Tokyo and surrounding areas on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings were shaking in the capital, but no damage was reported yet.
No tsunami warning was issued either, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the marmoset monkey Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment a terrified monkey cowered in a toilet bowl before its callous owner flushed it down and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
She has now been banned from keeping animals for life by Gwent Magistrates&#39; Court, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts who are caring for Milly after her abuse say they have never seen a marmoset so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitating with staff at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing again with another rescued monkey called Moon.
The mother-of-four pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At Gwent Magistrates&#39; Court she was given a 12-week prison sentence suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned from keeping animals for life and must pay 12,000 crowns in court costs.
Small Monkeys head of rehabilitation for the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: &quot;Milly is fine but rehabilitation will continue.&quot;
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she&#39;s settled and happy with a male, the sight of new people can still make her panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly&#39;s abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered the horrific footage on the woman&#39;s phone following a raid on her flat over drugs allegations.
Milly can be heard swearing profanity in the footage.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey, saying: &quot;You want cocaine?&quot;
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to sell.
1,600 pounds worth of cocaine was found in her house (roughly 50,000 crowns), hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you&#39;re going to take the same things in freshman year as in sixth grade?
And the whole thing is killed by the idea of buffoonery, when no one, with the exception of honor, cares if you can or understand it.
Mainly write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if you can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone&#39;s been through it, and the absolute majority won&#39;t even bother to tell you that they&#39;re totally screwed.
So what the fuck is he studying for?
I&#39;m a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don&#39;t want and don&#39;t need to.
And at that point it&#39;s useless and you&#39;ll never get it into them anyway.
In part, they learn it for the many people who will need this thing.
But like, the remark that you don&#39;t really need all this while standing by the machine, I was completely serious... ...because you simply don&#39;t.
Plus, we&#39;re slowly getting to the time when not knowing is the mark of punk.
(In which our communist past and bullying against educated people and elites probably also play a part) However, the price of having barbarians stand by those machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached these dimensions.
Wedding at First Sight: Kadri and Andrea&#39;s War Continues!
Which is the main reason why he can&#39;t leave Switzerland right away,&quot; Andrea answered on Instagram in Stories to all kinds of questions from curious fans, what disappointed her about Kadri so much that she decided to end all contact and even block him on social networks.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it was creaky from the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, that is, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and even hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! he fumed at Kadri&#39;s turn in response to Andrea&#39;s accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Even his younger sister Linda didn&#39;t like Kadri&#39;s supposed honesty with his now ex-wife.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
Normally I don&#39;t comment on such things at all, and even in the family we never said these things to each other very much.
I definitely don&#39;t want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just can&#39;t stand it!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most despite his young age.
It saddens me even more when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would very much like everyone to know Kadri as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in the confession in response to Andrea&#39;s words.
I am really grateful to him for everything!
Of course people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him more than anything and we know the truth and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won&#39;t believe why.
Chao began his robbery spree in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, in the end he stole almost 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn&#39;t think of anything better than to climb up to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
One security camera footage shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted that he drank some alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he drunkenly decided to rob.
The whole matter is still under investigation.
The drunkard climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and its effectiveness is tied to the pandemic emergency.
When it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does limit the scope of business
Is that not enough of a reason for you?
The right to assemble will be limited but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to Saturday&#39;s elections to the councils of four municipalities
People voted for new councils on Saturday in the municipalities of Komňa in the Uherskohradišť region, Lužice in the Mosteck region, Nová Ves in the Libereck region and Rovná in the Pelhřim region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the number set by law or the elected councils have disbanded.
99 candidates applied for a total of 28 mandates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday&#39;s elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it, said Eva Krumpová, deputy chairwoman of the CZSO.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, the elections were more demanding in terms of equipment and personnel security.
The Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday&#39;s elections in Komni in the Uhersko-Hradišť region, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means the gain of two mandates.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52 percent of the voters voting for them.
Jana Křižková, the previous mayor of the village, who is a member of the Private Party, also got into the council on their behalf again.
Independent candidates won one mandate in the local council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimovsk region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 made it to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia na Mostecko were won again by the Association of Lusatia and Svinčice led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, just like in 2018, it has four mandates in the seven-member council.
The candidate Obec pro lid, which received the vote of 43.27 percent of the voters, finished second, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters went to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberecko were won by the independent candidates Naděj pro Nová Ves ahead of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gaining one more mandate and having three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The State Election Commission will discuss the election results on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign politician?
I think that you know very well everything that people here write to you.
You&#39;re just playing the fool so you have someone to &quot;argue&quot; with.
If not, that&#39;s sad.
I&#39;m not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was the goal, after all, to make them look good).
And I don&#39;t really care who believes what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it collected, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, such as the thirty-year-old one
Tl;dr: believe in the spaghetti monster, for example, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
A man fell head down from twelve meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
On Sunday night, a man survived an incredible fall in Ostrava, where rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Employees of the regional operations center received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man falling from a height.
Two EMS crews - medical and paramedic - went to the scene immediately.
After arriving at the scene, the paramedics discovered that the twenty-seven-year-old man had fallen from the window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should be, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in immediate danger to his life.
The attending doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation, and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the Ostrava trauma center for further care, informed the spokesman of the EMS of the Ministry of Health of the region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities than about the coronavirus
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the infection is mainly doctors and medical personnel.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We ask military doctor David Řezáč.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
After all, things happened at the UFC 269 tournament.
The outsider Julianna Peňová was able to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a defeater for seven whole years.
Charles Oliveira didn&#39;t hesitate at lightweight, putting on a great choke against Dustin Poirier to defend his belt.
Also picking up a win was Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt with a first-round TKO.
Sean O&#39;Malley also defeated his opponent.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women&#39;s bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the mutual battle as an imaginary &quot;dwarf&quot;, because Nunesova had not lost in seven years and was grinding her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunesová started her journey to victory very actively and even delivered a push kick to her opponent, sending her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack using the arm lever.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents treated each other with a lot of excellent strikes and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and knock back the attack.
The American prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Although Poirier did better at first, the cards gradually started to turn.
In the second one, Oliveira tried to be more active, and tried to hit the opponent with a lever on the arm.
He didn&#39;t do that very well, but after that he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of blows.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the choke.
The Brazilian thus defended his title, while Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O&#39;Malley claimed a sovereign triumph, having already used a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he charged him with a series of well-aimed blows and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was then able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
His hip or that hip?
At first glance, it&#39;s nothing complicated.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not difficult to determine whether they are masculine, feminine or neuter.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns whose gender is not fixed.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genders.
When inflected, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in the uninflected form.
For example, the words &quot;svízel&quot; and &quot;hip&quot; are both masculine and feminine, in the former they are inflected according to the &quot;machine&quot; pattern, in the latter according to the &quot;song&quot; pattern.
Another group of nouns has different forms already in the first case of the singular, for example: &quot;rádek/rádka&quot;, &quot;kedluben/kodlubna&quot; or &quot;brambor/potato&quot; (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example &quot;okurka&quot; in Bohemia and &quot;okurek&quot; in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, as are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: &quot;příkop&quot; and &quot;príkopa&quot;, &quot; donut&quot; and &quot;doughnut&quot; etc.
Some words that entered Czech from other languages were originally uninflected, but they gradually adopted Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression &quot;image&quot;, which is both masculine and feminine, or the word &quot;buffet&quot;, which remained uninflected in the neuter, but in the masculine has endings following the pattern of &quot;castle&quot;.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right at the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border due to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have started making their way to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the spot?
We didn&#39;t see the blue sky for three months and we were suffocating, describes the journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the fourth month have killed almost three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How are the local authorities and the residents coping with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison&#39;s government have done more to prevent the drastic effects critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in connection with climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová talks to journalist Ika Detrichová from Sydney.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That&#39;s why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how terribly widespread it is, so they try to hide it.
I don&#39;t personally know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how those people are often treated by those around them or even the police.
The victim should always be trusted.
It has become a trend for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
However, too many people still keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It is disgusting and spitting in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that &quot;most of the accusations are made up&quot; and that it is a &quot;trend&quot; you are only helping the sex offenders.
The Czech Republic is flooded with houses under construction, families do not have the money to finish them
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into trouble because of it.
She does not have the funds to complete the family houses under construction and the banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to finish the family houses already under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to houses under construction and not approved.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and pay the rent on top of that,&quot; says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two to three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of them have done it.
It is difficult for us as a construction company in that we have to adhere to some things contractually, even though the material has become more expensive.
So we work without earning,&quot; said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they counted on the fact that the construction of the house would cost them five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait,&quot; added Slivoň.
Of the materials, copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a lack of construction graduates and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of building permits is more favorable.
&quot;Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,&quot; explained Křeček.
We are doing well and we will do better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator ČRO - mujRozhlas
In addition to classic celebrations, the entrance into the new year has also traditionally been accompanied by politicians&#39; speeches.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO chairman Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman&#39;s Christmas message, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies addressed the nation.
What essential did we learn?
As for that, the diploma seems great to me right now, I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor&#39;s, I always work on it for a whole year and then I write the written part in a week or two.
Our statesmen are completely at ease, if a person is not a total monkey and has something left in his head, then the commission will not needlessly suffocate him on theory.
For example, I studied for a week for the state book and when I was at the end, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which immediately hit me and I got it right.
Otherwise about the projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we&#39;ve done it many times, it&#39;s really beneficial, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they&#39;re done.
In my opinion, it is great if there is an exam at the end of the subject, in which the knowledge gained in the project is reflected, not just a defense.
Everything is ok, but don&#39;t flood the e-mails and phones and don&#39;t send any packages to the embassy.
You&#39;ll be a pee like them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would be taking a lot of risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily put a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Winnie the Pooh.
Maybe even put it in such a way that he can kick Xi Jinping&#39;s ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under artists&#39; feet.
As soon as you don&#39;t post stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, it keeps changing which function is more important, like, comment or save.
It&#39;s been really bugging me lately, so maybe I&#39;ll have to downsize to tiktok, where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can&#39;t let it go.
In the end, I would perhaps be happy if something more user-friendly came along, which does not drain all the creativity and energy from the artists
Declaration of the Workers&#39; Party of Donbass
Union - yes, disintegration - no, opponents of the disintegration of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history took place.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open condescending attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, without regard for the people, signed an agreement that &quot;The Union of SSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist&quot;.
With one stroke of the pen, they &quot;cancelled&quot; a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by ten to eleven million.
Even without taking into account the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Białowieża Forest destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, slowed down agriculture, and separated from the world&#39;s greatest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically united in a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the East, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, giving up first the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as &quot;power vacuum&quot;.
Everything that was hastily betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries who accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It&#39;s Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK/kg.
I will buy it and put it in the fridge and make it for dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I don&#39;t buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK/kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat becomes a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the use-by date - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK more expensive and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I answer myself - nothing.
This crap about how if something is cheap, it must be bad, spoiled or of poor quality is terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently, I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out some kind of brochure, I always take similar things to help part-timers, they can&#39;t throw it away...
Well, the pamphlet was full of common sense and conservative views on how the world works, but nothing about god, I was confused, but I suspected it was going to be some kind of propaganda.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, he was a good old man, full of completely useless lessons, like how I should wash myself and not be a dick.
It&#39;s a shame about the paper, because of this the forests wouldn&#39;t have to be cut down.
I experienced something similar with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to comply with the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened me several times that she would hurt herself because I went out with a friend whom she did not like to hang out with.
Or also when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she burst into tears and begged me on my knees not to go anywhere.
She then began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and she started to be beaten on a stick.
After that, I ended the relationship by telling her that I was breaking up and lied to her, but that I could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to run amok again.
Such a person drains feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep your distance
When the insurance companies are furiously stealing by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for positives who would not even know about the terrible disease if it were not for the test.
All we get is complications for companies, carriers and others, due to their employees getting five days of house arrest in the random number generator.
In the West, they have stopped with this farce and have recognized that it is not worth solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Válek is new and he still has to steal something and fuel his ego by inventing bullshit.
I&#39;m looking forward to the return of the good old scumbag.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this unfair business, MLM recruiting is coming back to prominence.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into &quot;you don&#39;t need to be interested, mainly get people&quot;.
I was honestly interested in the products that I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk.
When the first money came in, one quickly realized that if one wanted to make money, one had to pitch a few certain products per month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, so you felt like a door-to-door pot seller.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one learned that one should not immediately jump at every tip and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn&#39;t put everyone in the same bag.
There are people in this business who are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won&#39;t brag about expensive consumer goods or a &quot;fat&quot; account.
I haven&#39;t experienced many such things in the company where I work.
HR is calm, the managers look after their own management and don&#39;t poke our noses into anything.
So, regular evaluation somehow happens, in the form in which it takes place it works quite well for us (set some goals for the next year, in a year we&#39;ll see what worked and what didn&#39;t) - it&#39;s more of a self-evaluation than someone evaluating you according to some numbers, etc.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are a bit unique even within our company - there are departments that are more &quot;corporate&quot;.
Sometimes you get the feeling that we are a near-startup squatting in the offices of a large corporation.
But it works so they don&#39;t bother us much as long as there are results.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, the British police searched without success for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the outgoing Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherskohradiště was found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
Out of respect for the family, we will not release any further information about the case.
Sincere condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on the bus on her way home from work, she had to withdraw money from the ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by work colleagues five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol included her among the missing persons worldwide.
She also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
She did not disclose what role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects him of.

The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday&#39;s elections symbolically closes a rather demanding but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place in it.
At the same time, we mostly had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, evaluated Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission, and after approval they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major hiccups.
Dealing with how idiotic a large part of the population at all levels is, I still have a problem with that.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not beasts.
He would be stripped of the office of president and the ability to assume it again.
However, as others have mentioned, the chances of this actually happening are very small.
Moreover, I&#39;m not sure if shredding the file could even be considered treason.
High treason is an act by which the president of the republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex for an entire year is increasing
More and more young adults in the US are living their sexless lives.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce their sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
There are more women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they haven&#39;t had sex in the past year than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of the media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and less of a priority for young people, could also have contributed.
&quot;Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who say they have not had sex in the previous year has been rising rapidly,&quot; said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
For married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them reported that they had been without sex in the last year.
Among unmarried people it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious affiliation also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people and married people under 35 continues to decline.
Young people have a divided opinion on premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
&quot;It&#39;s true that they are a minority among singles in this age group, but their behavior is driving the trend,&quot; Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, among single people under 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the &#39;less religious&#39;, the trend rose from 10% to 20%,&quot; Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activities, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is lower among people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the spread of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People are spending more time online, thus &quot;replacing&quot; this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole covid vaccination mandate is about whether or not society should force a segment of the population into behavior they don&#39;t want to, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, and I am personally most interested in the issue of social conscience.
I.e. for example, the question of whether if we don&#39;t order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly blame the death of an 80-year-old man who didn&#39;t really know much, we didn&#39;t explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn&#39;t get vaccinated and ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are to blame for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who, alongside the SPD and KSČ, is talking about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly concluded that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really have themselves to blame.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This year&#39;s winter has so far brought one of the smallest amounts of snow in recent times in the Czech Republic.
The operators of ski areas cannot do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the cross-country Jizerské Padesátka, for example.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I would have one story, but it&#39;s not about pan-girls.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across town to the shipyard so we could ride the boats on the river.
On the way there, we walked along one such quite wide street, and who we probably don&#39;t see in the middle - followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she was saying to them.
&quot;They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them that I have no soul,&quot; she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We are so spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovič
After previous visits to Paris and Brussels, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was welcomed with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
&quot;We are opening a new chapter in mutual relations,&quot; Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine&#39;s territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the alarming movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the &quot;Normandy group&quot;, bringing together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked a migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to cross the (illegal) border.
He discussed additional sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU&#39;s eastern border.
According to the DPA agency, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the Lukashenko regime&#39;s inhumane treatment of refugees.
A drunken Polish nun blamed the accident, she tried to hide it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already being driven by another nun who tried to take the blame on herself.
When the police told her that she could still lose her driver&#39;s license for not giving way and leaving the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that the vehicle was hit by another nun who asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They breathalyzed her and immediately took away her driver&#39;s license after finding that she had over two per million in her blood.
At the same time, they informed her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
But Juraj Šajmovič did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies saw themselves in American stories about pet dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film industry.
After F. Brabce&#39;s cheesy film Gump - the dog that taught people to live, another film Tady hlídáme we is now competing for audience emotions in cinemas.
Co-writer of the script and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. loosely follows on from his previous film Tady hlídám ja from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a boarding house in Šumava, which is dying, so they start inviting dog walkers, Julie&#39;s father and his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the film&#39;s producer) struggled with the storytelling process in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative duo has written an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and feelings of embarrassment.
Let&#39;s sum it up.
Although a scientist, Julie succumbs to dark delusions in her desire for a child, and when the right &quot;constellation&quot; comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined - on the hood of a car or a church tower (during an ongoing excursion with a local guide, of course), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, after which the family takes her to the hospital so that a miraculous healing process by a dog can take place in the heart of Šumava solitude.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at what kind of content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a competition of dog handlers, a Šumava charlatan, policemen arriving on a tip-off to look for &quot;drugs&quot; and discussing over herbs the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which, of course, the baked family in the boarding house gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up from a severe coma and immediately sits curled and made-up with a cigar at the family table and demands her father&#39;s whiskey and slop like a cured vegetarian, you can&#39;t help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators explain to the viewer that &quot;this sometimes happens after a coma.&quot;
Šajmovič&#39;s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a feeling for the characters&#39; characters and the point, and directorial leadership.
The acting is uneven, the editing is clueless and the overall impression is dull.
No matter how Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to hold their parties, they don&#39;t have much to play.
The only plus point of the film remains the poetic shots of Šumava nature by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It&#39;s not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog talk, let alone the more popular profanity the characters commit.
Even years of membership in the Dachshund Breeders&#39; Club are not an argument - as in the case of the producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship between man and dog, there must also be knowledge of the craft if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family film, there is a little too much erotica and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateur piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from idiots just like you.
There&#39;s a difference between offering and forcing, here&#39;s how you understand shit, but that&#39;s only because you&#39;ve never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn&#39;t want it, the answer will always be no.
If you kept listening to kids like that, you might change your mind.
It&#39;s a job like any other, in this case a part-time job for extra income.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
&quot;The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we observed at some stations, is unusual,&quot; confirms the Israel Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore more of an exception.
It&#39;s good for us.
It hasn&#39;t rained here for a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, Wasím Ashkar, a resident of Nazareth, rejoiced.
Precipitation in Israel occurs almost exclusively in the winter months, it is abrupt and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only forests, but also drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel&#39;s largest freshwater resource, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning about drought for a long time.
&quot;It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation here may decrease,&quot; predicted in 2018 the spokeswoman for the Israel Water Management Authority, Uri Schor.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or waste water recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
There are more and more tanker trucks on the streets of Amman, the capital of Jordan.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
&quot;This year, my orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years,&quot; reported tanker truck driver Imád Sulejman in September.
Clashes broke out between farmers and security forces in Isfahan, Iran.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The bed of the local river found itself completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel is preparing a military intervention against Iran
Israel&#39;s defense minister said the talks in Vienna had produced &quot;no progress&quot; and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he has ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had produced &quot;no progress&quot; and world powers &quot;understand that the Iranians are playing with them.&quot;
About 3 years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
In the end, I discovered that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don&#39;t like these scams, I pestered the lady for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to call me crazy, but a pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, they were awaited by plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major influx of people interested in skiing this weekend.
After the heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski areas have started operations thanks to this.
Skiers were not deterred even by the obligation to show a covid certificate at the lifts.
While lift operators do not complain about lack of interest from customers, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region hit the cross-country trails and slopes at the weekend.
Skiers were blessed by the weather, which offered sun and excellent snow conditions today.
&quot;We are satisfied, the opening weekend really went well since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,&quot; Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing of the new season.
For example, Ski Aréna Karlov or the center in Branná na Šumpersk were open.
Weekend attendance was very good, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are perfect.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, Rostislav Procházka, the representative of the ski center in Branná, was full of praise.
Ski area operators can only sell ski passes to people who have been vaccinated or are within a period of time after experiencing covid-19.
With some exceptions, people are ready for it and prove it with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told ČTK.
&quot;We only recorded units of incidents,&quot; he added.
Some rental companies and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It&#39;s not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Skiopava shop in Opava.
He expects a greater rush during the season of ski courses.
David Šinták, the manager of the Králové Hradec company Snowbear, also feels that due to covid there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were already almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told CTK.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental office in the Novako complex in Boží Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago, and those interested now have to order them in advance.
&quot;We are starting to rent cross-country skis this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,&quot; said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the complex.
According to her, the interest in the ski school is comparable to the period before the epidemic.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life here like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often impossible to find a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and skilled people who have no property here go abroad.
The owner of the company does not just go abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not see a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary started when Orbán won one fine day, ruled for a year, and suddenly annual emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
Another question is elections at all.
If life is crazy here, some traditional V4 maniac can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose assets cannot be put on a plane will remain.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in blood because of a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
At the same time, the actor published a photo of his bloodied face on social networks.
Is it a real injury or is it makeup for filming?
The London police are still looking for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
&quot;Petra&#39;s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her,&quot; Lucy O&#39;Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
&quot;Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,&quot; she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a &quot;nurses&#39; assistant&quot; at the Evelina London Children&#39;s Hospital, which belongs to the Guy&#39;s and St Thomas&#39; hospital association.
&quot;We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing,&quot; the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
&quot;We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police,&quot; the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová, who drew attention to the Srncová case at a press conference on Saturday, also calls on the public to cooperate.
&quot;She&#39;s been missing for a few days, she&#39;s only 32, she&#39;s from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death,&quot; said the Labor politician, holding a photo of the woman distributed by London police.
&quot;I feel like we all have an especially big responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family, working here for our health care,&quot; Harman said.
The police had previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information regarding his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (ie about 5 divisions).
I don&#39;t underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not &quot;huge amounts&quot;, but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of Invasion and are getting fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don&#39;t know what made him think that Russia wanted war.
War is bloody expensive fun and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in 1938 is off in so many ways that I don&#39;t even know where to start.
I can already compare that with the first Punic War and the &quot;annexation&quot; of Sicily :D
I can imagine Russia annexing those ridiculous republics after Ukraine announced it was not going to abide by the Minsk agreements.
That&#39;s all, and the &quot;concentration&quot; at the borders would correspond to that.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague&#39;s integrated transport (PID) can expect several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly joining the integrated system.
From Sunday, express trains from České Budějovice stop at the Zahradní Město station in the capital.
In the suburban train service, S7 trains will depart, passing through Prague&#39;s main railway station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will soon expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go as far as Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Starý Splavů and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové Regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be canceled, 37 new ones will be introduced, and traffic will be adjusted on 12 operating ones.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague&#39;s Zličín, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the canceled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovník will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend, when express line number 404 will depart.
Lines 400 and 410 traveling to the Liberec region are newly included in the PID system.
They depart from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Nádraží Holešovice station.
Backbone line 400 goes via Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nové Bor, and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes via Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimon and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, has been canceled or newly restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Kolín.
Changes await passengers in other places as well.
Buses are replacing some canceled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have changed, and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovick in the Pilsen Region have been adjusted.
A healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I work a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only option to get food is to go to Billy&#39;s next door or to Lidl a little further.
Since I don&#39;t have any exercise, I don&#39;t have the energy to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy at most pizza buns and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy food without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately that&#39;s the way it is.
And these are not trees that you must see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the sapling may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I&#39;m not saying that this is the only reason why they forbid us to ride off-piste, but it is one of them.
Dara&#39;s confession about her relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn&#39;t looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They have been together since the summer, the famous football player even got a divorce because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans, in which she explains why she hid her love from them for six months.
&quot;I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, sorry, Nedvěda,&quot; jokes Dara Rolins, who is head over heels in love with the most successful Czech football player.
It is said that he packed her, not the other way around.
They are the center of attention for three days, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn&#39;t look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don&#39;t know who&#39;s worse off.
Whether it&#39;s those who don&#39;t care at all and it jumps out at them even out of a can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you and your husband or girlfriend are a good match for each other, or you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners in detail and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That&#39;s a joke, that&#39;s what you want, bothers Dara.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rollins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been working there for a long time as the vice president of the Juventus football club.
They came out with the truth only now, because they were waiting for Nedvěd&#39;s divorce to be finalised.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but on paper they have only been together for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We too are only people, we have families, children, a past and dreams.
We&#39;re not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That&#39;s why I love my new man and I stand by him just as he stands by me. For better or for worse, Rollins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters have probably already said everything important, I&#39;m just confirming that the dormitories are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found subletting together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know, who will you live with
Apartments are usually not advertised very far in advance, so you probably won&#39;t find much now, but it certainly won&#39;t hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, definitely avoid not only Cejlo, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that&#39;s a pretty bad address), even some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, the Veveří district is very student-friendly, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides, it is close to most of the faculties of BUT (I don&#39;t know where exactly you get on).
So I&#39;ve never looked for rent, but I&#39;m a native of Brňák, so I can possibly advise on Brno as such, if you still need any information :)
But this is an example of completely &quot;normal&quot; thinking.
Because of what a few doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it&#39;s actually perfectly fine that the state doesn&#39;t adequately fund some schools.
Either let them study what they want and pay for it from their own money, or let them follow the state and the state will pay for it.
After all, we can&#39;t let a private actor control a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to the full state subsidy and thanks to that he will be able to learn whatever he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who, two days before, expressed himself in this way about a petition action for the boycott of a totalitarian state:
So, for you, a vote against someone having an abortion is the same as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I would consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloguing/digitizing that (even long-term professionals) either somehow throw it out of sight, or write something like xxx *** or ... (according to convention) and in a note that it is illegible .
The truth is that in this case it&#39;s quite readable, so I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend it at all.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note, depending on what program you use.
If you wanted to be a regular and diligent student, you could look in some character databases and look for the closest one.
But since it looks like you&#39;re pulling from a book, I&#39;d guess that the author or printer simply made their own mark to match what&#39;s physically on the coin.
PS: Isn&#39;t it the Odrysian Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odrynská?
PSS: someone has already cracked it for you here.
Look at that comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians have no idea what the &quot;topic&quot; of our presidency will be.
That&#39;s a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood some text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for that anyway, that is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, establishing above-standard relationships.
In addition, with the English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don&#39;t understand the hate for Cejl.
I&#39;ve been working there for the third year now and I&#39;m totally fine.
How many times I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never a problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has almost never set foot there in his life.
Yes, probably the majority of the Roma population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the sidewalk and park where they are not allowed :D it&#39;s definitely not that I&#39;m afraid to go out on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
A lot of apartments there are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dada and his lover Gelemová like a stake in the fence!
Who will she spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don&#39;t have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw Dada&#39;s wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, the saxophonist told Blesk, confirming Patrasova&#39;s words that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn&#39;t happen.
I really don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucia, probably perfume.
I&#39;m a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video at the Richman club.
I&#39;m alone here, but I don&#39;t feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, claims Slováček, who was happy to meet Luďek Sobota&#39;s wife Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don&#39;t understand why it should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I know of no other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, so only firefighters and nowhere else have such a high percentage of medically trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava is the fault of the previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, water has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and places where there has been no shortage of moisture are also recording a lower amount of precipitation.
The cause of the drought that prevails in a large part of Central Europe is climate change.
But the way we manage the land also intensifies the impacts.
What to prepare for in connection with the drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes, it will be like that, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I know what it&#39;s like to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also generally a hoot.
And whether you are a hockey team &quot;bear Russia&quot; or &quot;llama China&quot;, losing by two goals even if you don&#39;t have to win the game at all costs is different than when it is tied.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators who point out, what the referees notice or do not notice, whether men&#39;s or women&#39;s hockey, it&#39;s all strange, but that&#39;s probably the case with all sports, UEFA and &quot;Italian actors&quot; or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it&#39;s like always, and that the Czech Republic lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic &quot;they lost&quot; vs &quot;WE won&quot;.
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new infections were registered in the last 24 hours.
It is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an &quot;inevitable&quot; large wave of infections caused by Omicron, said on television on Sunday, Dr. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser for the UK Health Safety Authority.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already being hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
So far, no one has died from omikron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
British Labor leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place &quot;virtually&quot;, via a computer.
However, it was attended by groups of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
Pressure is growing in Britain to remove Johnson as prime minister.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson&#39;s ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV&#39;s commercial editor for Britain: Two years ago today, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning the Conservative Party is talking about removing him as Prime Minister.
Remarkable how quickly events developed.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán&#39;s 12-year rule.
These will be elections of pan-European importance.
How fair can you expect them to be?
They won&#39;t be fair.
They probably won&#39;t even be free, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of constituencies to profit from it, and does other small and big tricks.
The last one so far sounds like everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from decided precincts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat that they will not be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is significantly different.
Before, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but by how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that a united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is very unusual for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won&#39;t they play even harder in an effort to hold on to power?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to the independent media, in which he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you speak of?
Yes, that&#39;s one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time when I was 14, my parents don&#39;t have much patience, neither do I, my dad has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely hard (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I am very choleric and I got very angry as a child, to the extent that I was lying on the floor in a convulsion and was completely blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me educationally, sometimes it was more that they didn&#39;t know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things with violence, as a child I used to fight quite a bit, now I at least hit something to relieve myself, and when I was younger I used to slap my parents on the hand for example (so that I wouldn&#39;t get too hard on the handle), so never anything extreme, but always I have that urge.
I am not able to determine to what extent it is due to my explosiveness, but the education certainly has a part to play.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with my children and solve it the same way.
I think that hitting children is simply wrong and that my parents shouldn&#39;t have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer &quot;educational,&quot; but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws something up, it&#39;s probably not possible to at least not a little cold, so I don&#39;t blame them.
It doesn&#39;t offend me, I don&#39;t understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
Laws should be clear and unambiguous.
Therefore, I would call those that the laws create in such a quality as kundas.
Otherwise, I would like to know if you are not afraid of a loss of income?
Can you really count on the fact that people want and buy the product and you will have something to pay the mortgage?
Kočner&#39;s monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins in the trial of the four accused in the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It mobilized civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Kočner and his connections to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
Journalists are largely to blame for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No way, they let themselves be fooled and the company rejected it.
Czech TV was dying of covid half a year ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage is nowhere to be found
The proposal of Minister Karel Havlíček needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law that was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorization of a deep repository for highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Association of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The local governments expect from the law a significant strengthening of their options when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
Municipalities particularly criticize the draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which is available to the Platform: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Storage Administration to request the consent of the affected municipalities before starting specific proceedings.
The submitted proposal of the substantive plan almost completely neglects the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere extras in the permit procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting a site for storage, its permitting and operation.
In reality, according to today&#39;s legal standards, municipal representatives do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in some permit procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is made by the authority or the minister whose interest it is to issue the permit.
A potential lawsuit does not have a suspensive effect on the execution of exploration or construction work.
The co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those that have already advanced in allowing storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL &amp; PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and follows on from the contract with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works is approximately 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the village of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and spokesperson of the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who only pushed the adjustment of the position of municipalities vis-à-vis state authorities in the search for deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand for this.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities for such a fundamental construction in the same way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep storage unites 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) in order to promote a change in the state&#39;s approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of a location for possible storage be conditional on the prior consent of the affected municipalities.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight by fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, the doctors finally scared him.
They told him that if he didn&#39;t lose weight, he would die.
And it took.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He showed off his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fatty from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body was causing the furniture to creak.
&quot;I put everything in my mouth,&quot; the actor told AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to take it slow.
To move, to exercise.
I&#39;m getting to an age where I can&#39;t afford to sit still, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss and in what you want to use the word &quot;boss&quot;.
If it&#39;s some text on a platform that expects readers from a gaming environment, I wouldn&#39;t translate it at all.
If it were for example a formal or university text, I would probably be looking for a better way to describe or explain the boss.
In addition, there are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, so &quot;boss&quot; is something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) that do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where there are bosses, but the player does not directly fight them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they even be called that?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It&#39;s probably not even possible to translate boss in a flat, one-word way, Czech and other languages don&#39;t solve it somehow (only Catalan, which translates boss as the final opponent, is interesting).
In short, it is generally significant to the story or the game, a computer-controlled, antagonist stronger than all previous ones and watching over the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is looking for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police also got involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since December 3.
The Czech police also joined the search.
He has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště since December 7.
At the same time, he helps the British police through Interpol.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular because of her.
So the whole world is looking for Petra.
&quot;The Czech police closely cooperates with the British police,&quot; confirmed police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová.
&quot;We share information about the case together,&quot; she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
She should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her
Local MP Harriet Harmanová also joined the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra&#39;s face.
&quot;We are very worried about her,&quot; she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have already arrested one suspect in connection with the disappearance.
But it is not clear who it is and what he had in common with Petra.
Agent Tesla terrorizes the Czech Republic before Christmas.
While data in October showed a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month attacks significantly increased as the end of the year approached.
We saw a big campaign related to Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers&#39; strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the e-mail is intended to attract the user&#39;s attention with a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was marked as Copy of Receipt Corrections for 11.2021...exe,&quot; said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes functions that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex e-mail clients.
The malicious code actively searches for saved credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the attackers&#39; activity increases again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
In contrast to Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists detected campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but it is still responsible for almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with an .exe extension called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
An attachment in Czech can be far more dangerous for a Czech user.
Security analysts note a significant decrease and dampening of activity for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had any major attack campaigns in the Czech Republic for the past several months.
Today&#39;s bunch of smart people who don&#39;t need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The parade through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Based on footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of the estimate of around 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the embankment and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously join the parade of about four thousand demonstrators.
I claim that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the permanent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to the fact that they found a common language.
Only anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The events of the Chcípl pes association are growing in popularity, it reminds me of Million moments for democracy upside down.
Sometimes I have the impression that they even rent the same stage and equipment.
It is hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer does not become four or more doses.
It certainly won&#39;t be a left-wing or center-right movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to revaccinate every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists, of which humanity is justifiably proud.
The stalemate is over, Bulgaria has a new prime minister heralding change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has appointed Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November election, to form a new government.
It has already managed to assemble a broad coalition government, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost the elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not come to an agreement, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is looking?
The footage taken &quot;secretly&quot; is a global hit.
Concerns grew in Britain over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work in the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, her former employer or the MP representing the part of London where she lived are calling for information about the children&#39;s hospital worker.
&quot;Petra&#39;s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are becoming very worried about her,&quot; Lucy O&#39;Connor of the Lambeth police department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
&quot;Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,&quot; she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech left work on Sunday, November 28 around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to the British media, Srncová worked as a &quot;nurses&#39; assistant&quot; at the Evelina London Children&#39;s Hospital, which belongs to the Guy&#39;s and St Thomas&#39; hospital association.
&quot;We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra who is missing,&quot; the healthcare group said in a Twitter post.
&quot;We would encourage anyone who may have any information that may help locate her to contact police,&quot; the statement continued.
Zdeňka Dvořáková Kocourková, an amateur painter of children&#39;s rooms from Šumper (and also a regional pirate councillor), was reported by an anonymous person as violating copyright with her paintings.
But the court recognized that the paintings of Krteček in Šumper&#39;s rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem, there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover for a month.
It was about life.
The municipality referred the complaints to the ŘSD, to which the road belongs, and since it allegedly did not respond, the hole continued.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the ŘSD began to &quot;resolve the situation intensively&quot;.
