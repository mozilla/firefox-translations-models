An unusually open and unique image of Karel Gott in a feature-length documentary film by Olga Špátová
This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! To record with a man who has remained in the limelight of Czech culture for more than half a century thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immense diligence was and is a great honour for me. I accepted the invitation to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, whose art has brought joy to three generations of listeners, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
Thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, the first day of filming took place on 22 October last year and the last shots with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives himself to his fans, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been giving joy to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has engraved himself in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a showcase of the indisputable fame of Karel Gott and his achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott Phenomenon with this one. Everyone is different. At least because we filmed them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, almost intimate confession, which he gave us and which confirmed to all of us what a legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in the Czech Republic and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team in such a way that we often let ourselves be carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let her into our privacy, thanks to which I was able to talk about relatively intimate topics. She and her husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary. But because I had a beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since there were a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was that it would be released in cinemas next spring. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself.
Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are growing reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and the situation is even more serious than humanity has ever realized.
The study is based on field research in a tropical forest in Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects are now "ten to sixty times less" in the forest. It is a decline of the entire population, not the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna that is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also declining.
The authors of the research put their conclusions in direct connection with climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become a driver of the collapse of the food chain. According to the team author, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.
A major article in the Washington Post was published Monday about the report, which headlined the new findings as hyper-alarming. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," said entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, citing the paper as an independent expert.
The extinction of insects also concerns Europe. "In our country, the decline is also an order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "In our country, it just runs for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek to explain why scientists could measure such a rapid decline in the rainforest compared to the 70s.
Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and gone to war with Germany? Three times NO
An undated picture shows Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the fortresses was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies got involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would have knocked out the most Czechoslovak soldiers? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would not have been either of these weapons, although the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses – due to blisters.
Police union chairman Štěpánek resigns, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave his post. This was reported on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has led the trade unions since 2005. He will be the president of the union for another two months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that this week I handed over my written resignation to the Presidium, after which I will serve full-time for another two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I made my decision, as a free man who doesn't want to be tied to a trade union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said of the reasons for leaving.
The Independent Trade Union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of security forces and employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union participated in police protests against budget cuts and petitions for better conditions for security forces. In 2011, he also got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior Radek John and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the governing coalition later agreed on John's departure.
The museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with its exhibition
An imitation of a normalization room with a television showing footage of the brutal police intervention against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague. This is also on the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said exhibition curator Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration in Semily on November 22, and then every day more people gradually snowballed," he said. Among the most active at the beginning was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the town and its immediate surroundings to sign Charter 77, and the Dědeček family, who distributed the petition A Few Sentences. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also formed relatively quickly. "One specificity is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
Visitors should be drawn into the events in the city at that time by about 50 photographs, pictures taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on 27 November 1989 filmed by František Tomíček has also been preserved, which will be played in a loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily archive also lent a number of preserved banners for the exhibition. "They were: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some changes in the town were very fast at that time, for example, already in December, people decided in an all-Semily vote that the square would be Rieger's and canceled the previous name Gottwaldovo.
The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to the witnesses and students what came before, such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the museum of the workers' movement at that time," Chvátal said. One room is just to evoke the feeling of how it might have looked in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters With us to Europe or Václav Klaus is still there under the heading of the Civic Forum with the beautiful motto "Every man for his community," the curator added.
Let the fans be positive, Hasek wishes. Sparta is waiting for a hit in Pilsen
"We will play to the limit, we will do everything we can to succeed. To manage the match in terms of games and results, "promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for club television.
In the week the goal decided the cup duel in Jihlava (2:1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She's relieved, but she's still struggling with the game.
Although the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, Sparta football is still looking for a face, which coach Václav Jílek spoke about at the beginning of his engagement.
"But it's still Sparta, which has very good players. A difficult match awaits us," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy sady for the last time, in mid-May it was a clear affair in the superstructure. The guests left after a mindless performance with a 0: 4 beating, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While back then the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, now Sparta loses nine points after ten matches of the new season. He's having one of the worst starts to the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation either for us or for the fans, who would like to see their beloved club completely different than it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if Pilsen will be able to use Tetteh, who received a two-match penalty for exclusion in Pilsen, but on Friday appealed against him.
Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec remain on the numerous infirmaries, who as the only one of the squad remembers the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
Home, who including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín won the last five matches, should miss only midfielder Cermak. And as a captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan pupil.

"A terrifying result of the study." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fears that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on mosque construction. 80 percent of those polled are in favor of greater monitoring of Islamic centers.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, saying the presence of Muslims sometimes makes them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could, over time, lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. The religious freedoms granted to Muslims threaten to be narrowed."
Among believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. Dialogue and education could help blunt polarization, according to the sociologist.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by voters of the extreme right, people without a university education or seniors over 75 years of age. On the other hand, Green voters, people under 30 and university graduates are the most friendly.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, about 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim places of worship and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The group's Austrian, German and Polish divisions also filed for insolvency this week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed and should be decided by the end of September.
According to Jan Papež, Vice-Chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, there are three possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will establish a new travel agency. "Which of them it will be, however, cannot be predicted, it will depend on the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, the travel agency also deals with cases where clients had to pay for their stay from their own, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. CK promised to pay its clients, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to the Czech News Agency one of the cases in which a local hotel fired all tourist offices. "The hotelier could not determine who belonged to German and who to Czech society. Therefore, he threw everyone out of the hotel, even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British Thomas Cook Group increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the other hand, the company's net profit decreased by approximately seven million to CZK 15.3 million. From previous years, however, the company remained unpaid loss of almost CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, there is also Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump considers cancelling Chinese stock registration in U.S.
The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking the permission of Chinese companies to trade on stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. The shares of the affected companies on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, dragging the entire market with them.
The withdrawal of the shares would be part of a broader effort to curb U.S. investment in China, the source added. He confirmed a Bloomberg report that had recently caused a shock to financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost between two and four percent.
According to government data from February, shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US stock exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE. They also include at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg pointed out that a precise mechanism has not yet been worked out to ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, who has given the green light to negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries is having a negative impact on the world economy and raising fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to get Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the US.
According to CNBC, trade talks between the US and China are expected to resume on October 10. Its goal is to end the trade war.
Police charge CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
Police have charged Aleš Pangrác, the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, over promotion contracts. Pangrác confirmed to SeznamZprávy that he took over the accusations this week. Czech Television (CT) reported last year that police officers were reviewing contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to police, part of the money went back to Pangrác, the server writes. In the case, criminalists were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), whose department CzechTourism falls into. The investigation in the case is ongoing.
Detectives from the National Center against Organized Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The official computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The search warrant for Dostalova's home, which was previously cited by Czech Television, stated that in 2016, when she was a deputy, the minister decided on CzechTourism's expenses for the benefit of selected persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová said at the time that she felt absolutely innocent, that she had not made a mistake, that she could document everything and that she fully cooperated with the police.
According to the agency, it was the fault of an individual. The media have previously reported that he is the former director of the regional partnership department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. This showed that the CzechTourism agency concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, they accused me. But I don't want to comment more," Pangrác told Seznam Zprávy.
Vandal damaged the cemetery in Dobruška
According to the notification received by the police, the vandalism on the scattering meadow inside the Dobruška cemetery should have taken place on Wednesday between 13:00 and 17:00.
"The material damage was estimated at CZK 60,000. Police officers are asking any witnesses to the incident to report their findings in person at the duty station or by phone on the toll-free line 158," police spokeswoman Lucie Konečná said.
Criminalists are investigating the case as damage to someone else's property and disorderly conduct, for which there is a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Hundreds of enslaved children were freed from a religious school in Nigeria
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, and Reuters, citing a police commissioner, said there were more than three hundred children aged five and over. Some were chained together, others were chained to iron rings in the wall.
Kaduna police chief Ali Janga told the BBC that the raid on the school was carried out on the basis of a denunciation. He called the school a house of horrors. Starving people were held there by force, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was razor wire above the walls. According to him, this is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, including local teachers, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo.
The children told police that their parents or relatives had taken them to the school, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who are from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north," Sabo said of the victims' identities. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal's school masqueraded as a religious school focused on the study of the Koran.
The freed were taken to the stadium, where they are provided with aid and food. Some have already met relatives.
A French chef sues Michelin over the removal of a star. I suffer from depression, he says
Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January, a year after winning it. He intends to sue the publisher of the Red Guide to obtain the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competence of Michelin inspectors, who he says mistook saffron for cheddar. The first court hearing is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of the famous La Maison de Bois restaurant in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie lost one of his three Michelin stars in January this year. The publisher of the prestigious Michelin guide will be sued because the commissioners' conclusion was not properly founded. In addition, the removal of the asterisk occurred without any notice, he said. "I've been suffering from depression for six months. How dare you play with the health of the cooks?" said Veyrat to the commissioners.
Michelin allegedly gave the chef only vague reasons, such as the chef putting cheddar in the soufflé, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it, and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. From the beginning, I have been working with Savoyard ingredients with love," Veyrat said. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are fraudsters who only provoke disputes for commercial reasons." An indignant Veyrat does not understand "how they could dare to say that we put cheddar in our soufflé". "They also offended our region, my employees were crazy. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he fumed.
The distinctive chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners and therefore demands the exclusion of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do so. "If a business remains open and is reselected by our inspectors, we will continue to recommend it," said Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful accusation yet and that the lawyer is yet to help him formulate one. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat communicates with us rudely. But we will carefully examine his comments," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak script. Gemini with Will Smith did not horrify the criticism
The dystopian sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith faces his younger version in the film. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be released in Czech cinemas on October 10.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is at the cutting edge of his field. It kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang up his career. This, of course, does not please his employers, who send another killer after Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or more precisely, his younger DNA clone. Can one determined person win the battle over himself? Literally, this time.
A certain guarantee of quality was supposed to be three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee. Although this is his first sci-fi, he has a lot of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated, for example, in the above-mentioned Tiger and Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the hugely successful Game of Thrones. According to the first responses, however, even all this was not enough for a good film.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have enough character to elevate it," said Fionnuala Hannigan of Screen Daily.
"This disappointing film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. A weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," said Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter.
"Gemini is a case in which a huge amount of work has resulted in an incredibly tired action movie," says Variety reviewer Peter Deburge.
"A confused product born of a bizarre idea," IndieWire's Ella Kemp summed up the film in her review.
"It's hard to care that one man is a double of another when neither is acting like a human," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
List of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
Child accounts are provided by banks free of charge. However, you need to consider the offer, as some additional services for accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic maintenance is free, is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on the fact that the forgiven fees will be returned one day. They are probably not wrong about the small migration of Czechs between banks," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Small accounts," she says, can do almost everything adult accounts do. The child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, monitor account movements, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. Banks will open an account, but it is up to the parents to teach their children how to handle them and also control their payment.
"Quite flexibly, parents can set weekly or monthly limits, turn individual services on and off, and so on. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening on the account, whether by viewing it over the Internet or by informing SMS. Beware, they may no longer be free," adds Kuncová and adds: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and possibilities."
Strict but fair, we enjoy the hours! This is how Benešov grammar school students see their favourite teacher, a writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, Pavel Hoza is convinced. A high school teacher of Czech and history, he is also a poet, prose writer and revivalist of literary life in a small town.
Pavel Hoza's lyrics bring Bohuslav Reynek to mind. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, trembling grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have walked on them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This contemporary successor of Reynek teaches Czech, literature and history at the grammar school in Benešov, runs a version of the Prague Viola at the local Café na slovíčko and organizes the Benešov Literary Festival every year.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! He ended up in an institute
It was nerve-wracking. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father every moment. "He came home from school and lied with a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! Away from the cameras, he had to suffer like this on a wooden mat to massage his feet! "Ondřej came to me after filming and told me - aunt, I'm making these troubles and notes just so I wouldn't be here, because I want to go to the institute," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was happening behind the door of the studio. And the boy's wish finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from the family after filming and placed in the Educational Care Center in České Budějovice for a month. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then he was sent to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I arrived home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I hardly reacted to that at all. But then she wrote to me that the little one was in an institution, that then they returned him to them, now he is in the diagnosis center. They are both out of work," says Lucie's mother from the Pilsen region.
Lightning, of course, also addressed the other side, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta excused herself and hung up the phone.
Sparta does not want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed the two-match penalty
Football Sparta appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, which the player received from the disciplinary committee for exclusion in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0: 3).
The Letná club announced this on its Twitter account and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeal committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his sentence in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now striving for the twenty-two-year-old Ghanaian striker to play in Sunday's 11th round of the first league in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At that time, Olomouc appealed against the penalty for Šimon Falta, who on Thursday received a one-match suspension from the disciplinary committee for exclusion against Liberec.
The appeals committee did not manage to discuss the case, so the effectiveness of the sentence was postponed and Falta could play on Saturday, paradoxically against Sparta.
The commission finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the following week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
Disciplinarian Tetteh stopped his activity for a foul on Slavia player David Hovorka, for which he received a straight red card from the referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of a Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent Tomas Soucek has not been proven.
The Germans elected Keller to head the football association
As expected, Fritz Keller, the current head of the Bundesliga Freiburg, has become the new chairman of the German Football Association. The sixty-two-year-old winemaker, gastronome and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he had no opponent.
Keller replaces Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over the undeclared income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go on trial for possible bribery in awarding the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals would be to restore confidence to the union and lead it out of the crisis. "It's not going to be a One Man Show, a lot of people will be held accountable. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the motto: Together we can do it.
After being elected head of the association, Keller left his position in Freiburg.
The underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná was on fire, no one was injured
The underground of the ČSA Mine in Karviná caught fire this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. No one was injured, mining company spokesman Ivo Čelechovský told the Czech News Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in a face at a depth of about 1200 meters. "None of the employees were hurt, no one was injured. Mining rescuers immediately intervened on the spot, who destroyed the fire by direct intervention and also carried out an examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and made inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
In the former Ostrava-Karviná district, coal is mined only in the Karviná part, namely in the mines ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-North and ČSM-Jih. Mining in the Lazy Mine should end this year, and other mines are also gradually phased out. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its last year's production was 4.62 million tons. About 9,000 people work in the mines.
Berlin responds to public pressure and solves the housing crisis. It will buy 6,000 apartments from a private company
Berlin will buy 6,000 former social apartments sold by the city 15 years ago for 920 million euros (CZK 23.8 billion) from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros. It responds to public pressure rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher of the Left Party (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition has criticised the move.
"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give security to tenants," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over thousands of apartments located in the districts of Spandau and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensively. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that he estimated that housing units had overpaid about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation with their actions. The FDP said on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money."
In mid-July, Gewobag recovered 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, Der Spiegel reported on its website. The council did not disclose the price at the time. The dispute over flats on the former exhibition avenue from GDR times was accompanied by protests and made the front pages of the German press. It has become a symbol of the plight of tenants in large German cities, the newspaper wrote.
The German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. Rental prices have doubled in the past decade, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing a Brno-based company over the name Lokia. People will not confuse us, the Moravians believe
Nokia objected to Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. According to CCV, however, product substitution is not likely.
The Brno-based company that develops CCV software is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns do not like the fact that the Brno company's warehouse management program is called Lokia WMS, E15 reports. Nokia therefore objected to Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. The CCV considers that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that the program has already been used by two dozen customers, which has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand is recognized and trusted around the world. When someone attempts to register a mark that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we will take steps to protect our valuable asset," Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said in a statement.
Brno developers claim that they did not think about the brand famous in the past for mobile phones when creating the warehouse program. The name Lokia according to CCV comes from the Latin name for one species of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is supposed to be analogous to the movement of warehouse workers around the warehouse.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, which companies equip their warehouse operations, and we are not really heading into the field of mobile phone production. And we do not want to be compared to a brand that may be missing the train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák responded in E15.
CCV applied for protection of the brand in August before the launch of the program at the Industrial Property Office. "It applied for protection for goods and services belonging to classes 9, 35 and 42, because software belongs to class 9, related warehouse business management services belong to class 35 and computer software development to class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
Nokia's opposition is based on the fact that Nokia's earlier trade mark is valid for all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore naturally overlaps in Classes 9, 35 and 42. 'The CCV does not dispute the allegations made by the opposing party as regards conformity with those classes of goods and services. In reality, however, these are completely different brands focused on different target groups," Ondrášek said.
According to E15, the dispute over the brand can last for months and complicate the company's activities.
From Sydney to London in four hours? Possible reality in 2030
The Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket engine. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concordes. "When the Sabre engine is commissioned, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And for example, the distance between London and New York could be covered in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is exceeded by five times, are complicated by engine overheating. However, Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using super-cold helium to prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it's a rocket-aircraft engine hybrid that's powered by a stream of exhaust generated from the air," said Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't evolved that much in the last 70 years, whereas aircraft missiles have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a spacecraft."
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around the middle of next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
Kovosvit sells an administrative building and other halls. He expects worse times
Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, with a consolidated turnover of CZK 1.3 billion. Among the main problems last year, Kuchař ranked the lack of workers and shifts of subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools has fallen, by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decrease in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of CZK 1.3 billion and profit after tax of CZK 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to slim down Kovosvit and make its activities more efficient. The sale of assets is not part of a momentary solution, whether it is cash-flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.
Kovosvit exports about half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, and to a lesser extent Asia last year. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines enabling five-axis machining worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "Another contract of the same volume is under negotiation, which we would like to fulfill by the end of the year," said Kuchař. On the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, a company that is a subcontractor to Airbus. In May this year, it delivered another machine, and one more should be delivered at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2020.
This year's main corporate investment was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for casting cutters for foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and arms manufacturer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. At that time, the company had up to three thousand employees.
Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Sandor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated this week that the army planned the last farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence, against the wishes of the family, as bombastic as soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family since the beginning, the Friday date of the funeral has been agreed since the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as they pay military honors. We will only deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Blesk on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and will not miss all military honors, including a flight of fighter jets.
Around the last farewell to the popular general, however, there is a tense atmosphere. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by people who have worked with the general in the past!
These include former military intelligence chief Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Šándor remembers his former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and "good guy".
In addition, in recent years, he has regularly met him at the celebrations of the anniversary of the establishment of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Sandor told Blesk. But it can't.
"I know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize a funeral in this way," the security expert said. Nor does the allegedly considered closure of the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of military leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not secret, and neither are the heads of military intelligence, because they are promoted to Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media reports are true and the family has indeed allowed themselves to be sidelined by the military, it is of course a matter for the family. Personally, I would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and their wishes," Sandor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision between Milan's Rapid and Ford Mustang was reportedly caused by sports car driver Vojtěch Ch. (31).
An amateur racer in a curve should have entered the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů probably had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife, 47, was seriously injured in the accident and may suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police questioned the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Jan Šindelář's commentary: Managing railways as a company
Heaven's election, while perhaps not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, that hasn't changed because one of the members has resigned. The provisional arrangement lasts.
The selection process itself was a farce from the beginning, if only because the requirements for candidates were significantly relaxed, especially in the area of experience. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was supposed to work in the past have decreased. At first, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Nebeský submitted probably the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he beat experienced guys from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. The participation of interesting managers from the private sector was probably the brightest side (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, they know that they have only played the role of narrative backdrop in a political game.
Perhaps Nebesky will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best railway boss of all time. At least initially, however, it will be accompanied by a taste of political newsstanding. Czech Railways is not expecting an easy period, it has to cope with competition in the liberalization of the market and a lack of employees in operation. Train drivers, shunters and mechanics are missing. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in a china shop?
The second important group is creditors. How they interpret the games at the head of the tracks will be seen next spring, when the tracks defend the rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. It is sad that someone else comes to Moody's every year to defend the rating on behalf of Czech Railways. The agency did not miss the frequent changes in railway management and political influence on the company, criticizing them this summer.
Among other things, the ANO movement has the slogan that the state must be managed like a company. For starters, it would be enough to run a large state company as a firm rather than as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if it was led by the best. They volunteered, but the state despised them. It can certainly be objected that the post at the head of railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive ourselves the antics with the selection process.
The couple wrapped the with tape and drowned in the river, the bag was found by the children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouky. A twenty-seven-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old that she wanted to take care of. However, her ten years older partner did not like the fact that it was a, so he decided to get rid of her.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated its vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag that he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in a sack. At the moment when they threw the dog into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokeswoman Monika Kozumplíková.
The next day, children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they found the body of a dead dog inside. They called out to a woman passing by and ran away. The woman reported the incident to the police emergency number 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the townspeople, the police found out who is probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they weren't wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the incident took place," the police spokeswoman added.
Expert opinion from the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly agonizing way as a result of suffocation, when the animal suffered in a matter of minutes before death.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly show a clear intention to dispose of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible way, even though they could have donated or sold the dog. The Commissioner of the Criminal Police from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both so far unpunished accused could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková noted.
Thank you for dancing! Singer Leonard Cohen will release his last album posthumously
Thanks for the Dance will feature unreleased material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. In an intimate recording, Cohen symbolically comes to terms with his impending death. He died a month after the album's release at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials he had left behind. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or singer Beck, to name a few.
"When we were making music for my father's words, we used his own characteristic musical techniques. So he's still with us," Adam Cohen said of the album. "What amazes me most about it is the reactions of those who have heard it. One by one, they say Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in his characteristic honeyed voice. He sang about death, suspecting that he would not live to see the release of new material. He admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before his death. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen released a collection of his father's poetry called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the title Plamen on December 31 by Argo Publishing.
The first Miss Christ finally went into herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately saw through
The first modern Miss of 1989, Ivana Christová (49), had problems with overweight for many years, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly mental ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the days of Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it seems that she has taken those reproaches to heart and with the excess kilos went into battle. Even if it's a long run.
She used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But thirty years have passed since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty contest. Not only because of fame, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to conform to strict modeling rules that required her to be as thin as possible and often not to eat. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she wanted.
But she switched from hunger strikes to overeating, which immediately left its mark on her figure. She tried to disguise the extra kilos with various loose clothes, which added to the plump shapes.
Now it seems that Ivana really went into herself. She visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone present at the book launch of Miloš Zapletal (75) that she had seen through again and now has back the features of a charming brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first winner of Miss after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first beauty winner, but also the very first to be whistled by the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava as if deprived of her senses when she put on the crown.
"A parody of justice." Scientist warns of cancer from pollution, sitting in Turkish jail
Sik and other scientists participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Her conclusion was that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country is linked to an increased incidence of cancer among local residents.
In particular, the researchers mentioned the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which lies about 80 kilometers from Istanbul and is home to a number of chemical and metallurgical plants. People living in the surrounding area suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan takes revenge for coup, international criticism despite
It seemed to Sik that the government, despite the clear conclusions of the study, was not taking any action on the matter. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. The authorities subsequently began to prosecute him for leaking classified information.
"The study clearly showed to what extent the water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of studies directly related to public health can be suppressed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"Instead of pursuing alarmists through the courts, Turkish authorities should investigate this significant public health issue," said Andrew Gardner of Amnesty International's Turkey office.
Environmental and human rights organizations have long accused the Turkish government of failing to enforce environmental regulations despite the rapid development of industry in certain regions.
After the failed 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a massive wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including many employees of the Cumhuriyet newspaper. The authorities have also suspended or completely dismissed 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights groups accuse the government of using the coup attempt to persecute its opponents. But the authorities say these are necessary measures to ensure national security.
The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I don't take anything, I defend myself
The traditionally high-profile battle for the fastest man on the planet at the World Championships will be the hunt for defending silver medalist Christian Coleman. The twenty-three-year-old American is the leader of the world tables with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the peak of the season was jeopardized due to a case with missed doping tests.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without charges due to formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense was dated by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) back to April 1, 2018, the beginning of the second quarter, but he skipped the test itself on June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit the offense of three failed inspections in 12 months.
Coleman defended himself by forgetting to update the athletes' whereabouts in the app. "I don't take drugs, nor do I take anything legal. Many athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster recovery. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about," he said before the start of the World Cup.
His only defeat from six starts in the hundred this year came at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was beaten by compatriot Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but he will only run a double hundred at the World Championships.
On paper, the second fastest competitor with a performance of 9.86 is twenty-two-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has been successful so far only at American university competitions.
Thirty-seven-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 in Stanford in June, will defend his title. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb in only 10.29, because he slightly injured the back thigh muscle.
South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse and European champion Zharnel Hughes are also among the favorites. The fastest Jamaican with a time of 9.96 is 2011 World Champion Yohan Blake.
The men's hundred will begin on Friday with the preliminary round and heats. The semifinals and finals are scheduled for Saturday. The medals will be contested at 21:15 CEST.
Plane crash near Zinkov in the Pilsen region: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were on the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The plane at half past nine in the evening asked for permission to land at the airport Chaloupky near Klatovy," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said. This was also the last record, at that time it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov according to GPS coordinates.
However, it did not reach the Klatovy airport. The search for the missing aircraft, which sent a distress signal, was immediately launched. "In addition to the police helicopter, a military helicopter was involved," police spokeswoman Martina Korandová said. But the search operation did not have a happy ending.
In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last registered, the helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandova confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, pieces fell to the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and employees of the Institute for Expert Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Civilization in borrowed time
Recently I remembered a beautiful "line" from one of the great stories Šimek and Grossmann, partly set in a cemetery, which goes like this: "I warned her that she was crying well, but on someone else's grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians engaged in the senseless fight against climate change are now behaving in a very similar way.
They behave as if humans rule planet Earth. In fact, we are but a speck on its surface, which it can blow out with its gigantic powers like a violent gust of wind to the flame of a candle. Probably few of them look at the famous British and American natural history documentaries dealing with the destructive abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to "" and our advanced civilization will defecate from it.
And that this will happen in the near future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes are, in the opinion of leading volcanologists, "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it has to happen once, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any angry volcano, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can emit at least a hundred times more into the atmosphere than was saved at the expense of the people of Europe.
So it makes no sense to forcibly reduce CO2 production. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with a significantly higher proportion of it in the air, plants produce more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, any warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, a rapid return of an ice age.
Considering the still insufficiently studied influence of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we have only one reasonable conclusion: Let's try hard to keep the Earth as clean as possible and try to adapt to other changes that we cannot measure up to at the least possible cost!
Repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be delayed for a year
The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) postponed the deadline for submitting bids for the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí by three weeks. The original deadline for opening the envelopes was September 20, national park spokesman Radek Drahny said. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting bids is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that is acceptable, the work will begin as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the repair of the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected supplier of the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Administration, European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not at risk.
The KRNAP administration is not able to select a construction company for museum repairs. The second tender was announced this summer, because in the previous tender all the companies' offers significantly exceeded the then estimated price of CZK 65 million. The offers exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exposition, are estimated at CZK 210 million. In the currently vacated building, the KRNAP Visitor Centre should be established by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the exhibitions.
The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be the story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative gateway to the Giant Mountains for visitors. The Visitor Centre should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most comprehensible form and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities for organizing concerts, festivals, theater performances or lectures in the open air. The plans include the construction of a new entrance to the building, the creation of a research room or a café.
Toyota still believes in hydrogen, prepares the second generation of the Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never meant to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about it that even though there was practically no hydrogen refueling infrastructure in the world, it still put it on offer. Not to a completely standard, the customer really had to purposefully go after this car, but no one else offered such a variant at that time.
Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will arrive next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be priced on par with hybrids within a decade. Of course, this is connected with the development of pumping networks. But the future is as much associated with hydrogen as it is with electricity.
At the conference, the word hydrogen was often mentioned with the needs of ecological operation not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, boats, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to overcome long distances for one refueling. Purely battery versions cannot offer this. Thanks to its extensive experience and long development, Toyota could find new markets.
It remains to be remembered that, like Toyota, Hyundai also believes in hydrogen propulsion, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
When choosing a red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are the warm or cold type. Try a simple test - look at the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are the cold type, if they are green, then you are the warm type. When choosing a new red lipstick, first and foremost focus on the undertone sorting. Only in the next one, take into account the texture.
If you are a woman with a cold undertone, then lipsticks in purple, plum, cherry or mauve color are suitable for you.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose such lipsticks as well. You can recognize them by the fact that they tend to orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen that some veins look green and others blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.
Purposeful slander? Usti Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
The last time was late this month. The city administration attributes this to the rumors that have surfaced around the former director of the zoo and veterinarian Václav Poživil that he purposefully killed exotic animals he took care of. For example, it was a female rhino Zamba, a female elephant Kala or an orangutan Ňuňák.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of CZK 3.5 million excluding VAT and for the municipal Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of CZK 2.8 million excluding VAT," city spokeswoman Romana Macová said.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechyba (UFO) explained that the city is announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unfounded suspicions. I consider it a blatant disgrace to such a high-quality expert," she said.
According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. "It's definitely not pleasant. So far, the zoo has provided veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and a contract cost the same money. "However, the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of financing," explained Nikola Roštejnská, the zoo's spokeswoman.
Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he participated in a unique operation during which the cheetah Jane from Ústí nad Labem was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He served as the zoo's director from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on the anonymous rumors against himself. Yesterday, he did not receive phone calls or respond to SMS text messages.
As far as the contract for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians think that zero interest in it does not necessarily have to be a fear of similar purposeful accusations as in his case, but simply a lack of information. For example, the Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of it yet. "This is the first time I've heard it from you. No one approached us. I think such a thing will spread quickly," he added.
A new Underground architect will oversee Line D, bringing experience from the London underground
The Prague Public Transport Company has chosen an architect who will oversee the appearance of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become her primary task, her primary task will be the appearance of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing station. According to her, the metro cannot be seen only as a transport structure, traveling underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.
A Czech architect who participated, for example, in the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Public Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to her, 14 other bidders participated in the tender. "The selection process included a motivation letter and a CV. Apparently my previous experience in London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the local metro in a team of three people, decided," explains the new metro architect. Similarly, her practice at the Prague Institute of Planning and Development could have made the decision.
He does not perceive the metro only as a transport functional construction. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the metro will change, how the space will improve. However, I will find out how it will actually work in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to their ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed primarily at maintaining the context of all stations in case they are reconstructed," the design manual explains.
Whether a similar tool is a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal, or whether a personality can cover it, I really do not know yet," concludes Švarc.
Chirac will be buried on Monday and a public memorial service on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died Thursday at 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. This is reported by the French media, citing Chirac's family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at a commemoration at the Les Invalides in Paris, where the coffin containing Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Élysée Palace announced.
Crowds of people have been pouring into the presidential residence since Thursday evening to sign a book of condolences, according to AFP. This will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a national day of mourning.
Meanwhile, from around the world and from France, there are further reactions to the death of the former mayor of Paris and president from 1995 to 2007, whom Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today described as "French in the truest sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, because the politician was known for his love of their country and the sport of sumo. The news of the death of the former French president appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sports ones, notes the French press.
The tribal art museum on Quai Branly in Paris, which Chirac founded, will not charge admission for ten days in honor of the former head of state.
The opening of Pumpkin World delayed the ripening of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkův Brod region) - A farm in Nová Ves u Leštiny in Havlíčkův Brod opened Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations made from thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, because the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipka family fields have been ripening longer. Even now there are a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told the Czech News Agency today.
The Pipkas grow many types of pumpkins, but the weather has been bad for them for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed, and some species did not work out. "As usual, we have enough orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some species for connoisseurs failed," Pipková said. Nevertheless, you can choose from several types on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and carving decorations, through pumpkins for cooking hokage or elongated "spaghetti" to ornamental pumpkins of various colors and shapes.
Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually hoe the plants and harvest their fruits, cutting the pumpkin from the stem with scissors. The Pipkas have been opening the pumpkin world regularly since 2010, and last year they attracted thousands of people. The pumpkin décor is complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. About other options for modifying pumpkins in the kitchen, visitors themselves tell them. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired," Pipková said. She noted that some housewives also pickle pumpkins like cucumbers.
The meal voucher fee is planned by the Ministry from 2021. Nothing changes in terms of tax
The Ministry of Finance is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which employees would receive money for meals directly. According to the Ministry of Finance, a quarter of employees, i.e. about a million people who have not yet received meal vouchers, will also receive food support.
According to David Rýc, chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, however, even a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide catering to their employees, for example by importing food or by agreeing with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we are not changing anything about the tax advantage. Furthermore, it will not pay health and social insurance," Schillerová said on Friday. It added that the limit for the maximum employer's contribution applicable as a tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the meal voucher price. The remaining part is paid by the employee, in some cases by the employer, but without the tax credit. The best value of the meal voucher for both employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Championship
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semifinals of the World Canoe Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. Another three Czech representatives will try to make the semi-final start in Spain in the afternoon repechage qualifying run.
From a strong representative group of kayakers failed Vavřinec Hradilek, who at the beginning of the ride received a fifty-second penalty for improper passage of the goal. Prindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can already rest and concentrate on Sunday's semifinals.
"I set myself the goal of going down to thirty for the first time, which I did. Not that I didn't care how I ended up, because Sunday starts very early in the morning, so I was hoping to be a little higher to have a better starting position, "said Prindiš and praised the comfort in Seu. "Before the patrol race, I felt the worst in the 14 days we've been here. But then in the race it was good and today it was better again. It's beautiful all the time, nice races, spectators came, so fine," he smiled.
Prskavec was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. In the first goals, it didn't really work for me. Then I drove the middle excellently, without any problems and I knew that I had mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go straight down and I turned the erka. Overall, I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we'll see how it goes," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that on Sunday they will go to the start at the end of the semifinal block. "I'm not an early riser, it's cold here in the morning, and when you're here at eight, you want to have a jacket and a sweatshirt," Prindiš said. "Overall, the semi-final lasts an hour and a half, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," agreed Prskavec.
Of the three Czech singles canoeists, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the twenty, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35th. "I went down the upper part as expected, in the middle passage I felt that I was not in time and was not going according to plan, but I managed to get into the comfortable line I wanted to ride. I made two nudges and I'm just behind the winner with pure time. I have a good starting position for the semifinals," Fišerová said.
Coal will give way to gas and nuclear. Renewables won't cover increased demand, says ExxonMobil boss of Europe
Renewable sources will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future energy demand. Due to the unfavourable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be supplemented with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the American concern ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil producers, said in an interview with HN. At the same time, he mentions that large storage facilities that could store unused energy from days when there is enough sun and wind are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil center in Prague, which employs 1200 people and whose task is to support the company's business activities and provide logistics and other services necessary for the company's operation.
Declaration of the end of the right in the Chamber of Deputies or What "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
In the media and commentary, there have recently been reports about the upcoming coalition of the mentioned parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.
Apart from the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects label themselves or what labels the mainstream media parrots. ODS is hardly centrist in its average of top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the urban pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its left-wing and so hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with TOP 09 in terms of its concept, ideology and voter focus (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And the KDU has long labeled itself as centrist - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took them all out of one water clean? No, I am basing myself on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is individual freedom, free market and minimal state intervention in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfil this general assumption of right-wingness? How many laws have they supported in recent years to curtail people's freedoms by the salami method, raise taxes, confirm new regulations and increasing surveillance, increase ties to the socialist EU, or promote environmental and gender madness? A lot, a lot. Not their own labels, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wing.
I would not be surprised at all by the coalition cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, they simply belong together on the political map and apart from Christian or, on the contrary, homosexual and gender aspects, I basically do not see any obvious difference in them for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives. Nevertheless, the ODS has long portrayed itself as the "only right-wing" and by associating with these three entities, it has already openly revealed its true political affiliation.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned those stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties consistently and cheaply label critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Do they not or just do not want to understand that there are many people for whom Eurosocialism and growing lack of freedom do not smell as strong as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Aren't they hiding their complete argumentative incompetence and gratuitous or blind adoration of the EU situation?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, politics other than centrist politics no longer have a chance of greater success. Perhaps voters really want this kind of connection. Perhaps they want center-left politics under the guise of "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or cannot even identify them). I don't know. But I am certainly not one of those voters.
Unexplained death of a little girl (†8) in the Příbram region: The culprit does not face punishment
Unsolved cases are called "memorials" in criminological slang. But even these are investigated if new information emerges after years. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. In 1980, criminologist Jiří Markovič managed to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí valley, which was already 12 years old. This is going to be hard, very hard. It would be a place to start by finding the file, it doesn't have to exist anymore, talking to those who investigated it. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," Markovic said.
Under the previous regime, the public was not well informed about violent crimes, but according to Markovič, this certainly does not mean that they were investigated laxly. "It always depended on specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 50s of the 20th century can be destroyed, although unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Lucie Bílá's father wasn't a fan of her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is originally a seamstress by profession and real name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glassworks!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love for singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed in the cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother sat. At that time, a singer was born in me," she admitted to Impuls radio.
Her father, however, was a little worried about his daughter's future and advised her to follow the path of a craft that has a golden bottom.
"Dad always said, 'Craft girl, craft. Walk with your feet on the ground!' He even persuaded me to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks doesn't work anymore, I do. I am a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants from beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs with money," she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new toll is not in danger, Kremlík reports. But a change of operator is in play
On Friday, the Ministry of Transport started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a backup plan that the state would use if the current toll contract was legally canceled. In addition, the state is preparing other provisional solutions if it does not finish the tender in time. This was stated on Facebook by the Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO).
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) prohibited the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year postponement. The ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not in jeopardy. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services for the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," the minister said.
The state would thus look for the operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to Kremlík, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on my experience with the toll tender so far, I am deeply convinced that the Office for the Protection of Competition is wrong and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to a new operator within the period of 12 months set by it," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the Ministry will also prepare a provisional solution that would resolve toll collection for a temporary period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.
The state will probably not take advantage of the offer submitted to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. The Austrian company offered the state to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was cancelled.
At the same time, Kremlik reiterated that he believes that a backup plan will not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the Antimonopoly Office.
On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition issued a decision prohibiting the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until one year after the authority's decision comes into effect. This is not final and may be appealed to the President of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare the new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator was won by the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of CZK 10.75 billion for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, which failed in the tender with a bid of over CZK 13 billion.
I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around, says Jan Cina
"That was a great learning curve for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with afro dancing there. The way I have something Romani in me from my father, it completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
Much fresher memories than the series The First Step has the role of a painter in the new film Národní třída. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter must have tempted him a lot. "The work was challenging, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honest, but fun at the same time. It was shot on Národní třída, where I used to drive a car as a non-driver. A lot of filming was also shot in Jižní město in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is nominated for the Thalia Award for his role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the pinnacle of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just looking around. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, adding that he did not even think about the thank-you speech in case of victory. "Not really, but as a kid, when I listened to talk shows on the radio, I always imagined myself talking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To love each other and to perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed and recalled the Czech Lions awards, when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it wasn't long before he was lying on the ground. He was able to make it a virtue. He had a workshop called Vancura's Stairs, where he taught how to safely fall down the stairs at VIP events."
Děčín Zoo rejoices with a small macaque
"Our band currently has seven members. Her youngest member was born on August 17, he was born by a female Buffy and is her fifth calf, the father is a male Hitam. For the first few days after birth, the female carried the baby tightly pressed to her body and for a long time did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of age, however, the baby has already begun to gradually put it away for a little while and the keepers have known for a few days that it is a male, "said zoo spokeswoman Alena Houšková, adding that the Děčín Zoo has successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Crested macaques are the so-called endemics of the island of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live elsewhere in the world in the wild. A typical feature is black fur and a crest on the head, after which they are named. Crested macaques live in rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by fruits of virgin forest trees, which complement the flowers and leaves. The need for protein is solved by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and young.
"Apart from the natural enemies that are pythons, everything else is again written down by man. Locals hunt macaques as a favorite prey with tasty meat and for fur. The burning and felling of the rainforest is also fatal for these animals," the spokesperson added.
Germany reports its first case of West Nile fever from a mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria, for example.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a person contracting West Nile fever on German territory after being bitten by an infected mosquito. This was reported by the DPA agency. Until now, all sick people became infected with the virus while traveling or by contact with sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said a seventy-year-old man from Saxony had contracted the virus. The disease had a serious course and he was treated for brain inflammation in a hospital in Leipzig. He is healthy now.
West Nile virus was first detected in 1937 in Uganda. Meanwhile, it has spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 90s to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds, and also mosquitoes that become infected with their infected blood.
Managers of state-owned companies are now to go through a selection process. The law can be circumvented, says opposition
"This is a typical bill that is unnecessary," said Zbyněk Stanjura, chairman of the ODS parliamentary group.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to prevent the non-transparent distribution of functions in the future - critics talk about newsagents - in state-owned companies. Newly, applicants should go through a selection procedure at the given ministry and will also be assessed by the government committee for personnel nominations.
However, this is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like, because it will allegedly allow ministers to make excuses that selection committees are to blame for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the said committee will not be binding on the Minister. The novelty still needs to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: Driver crashed near village Kokory: Died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident occurred on Friday on a straight section between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old Fabia driver failed to drive and drove off the road. The car flipped over onto its roof and he was trapped underneath. He did not survive the injuries sustained.
"According to the initial information found on the spot, a passenger vehicle driving in the direction of Kokory went off the road, where it overturned on the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," police spokeswoman Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
And where are the viewers? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, because by pilgrimage to Doha, athletics has voluntarily and consciously renounced the thrilling atmosphere prevailing at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.
Giant banners on the walls of Doha's skyscrapers invite you to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, concerns about how dignified its sets will be are growing.
"Target tickets are sold out for all evenings," organizers say.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Khalifa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with brightly colored sails, on which the flags of the 209 participating countries are depicted. Athletics in Qatar has ventured into territory where it does not have roots despite the annual Diamond League meeting.
So let's not be surprised that last week only 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, i.e. less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set a goal to fill at least half of the uncovered parts of the stands. Therefore, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) are handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as laborers, as well as to children. Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF athletics association, has a positive comment: "This is how we can inspire future generations."
Wealthy Qatar has won world championships in handball and cycling in the past, and after athletics, football will come in 2022. The oil superpower's financial offers will always be lucrative, even for wealthy sports federations. This is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it, leaving aside the absence of fans in the stadium, we cannot help but sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletics Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have been better timed by the IAAF leaders - and for another year. The extremely late deadline, forced by the climate, disrupts the entire schedule of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start for athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations that promise ultra-modern and attractive mastery. That it's just 37 degrees? The stadium area is already artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are supposed to bring television viewers closer to what happens in athletes in hundredths of a second before and just after the starter shot.
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges Hradec Bek Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradec hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's match against the club where he recently worked. However, the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be in a similar situation, although they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Against Sparta, everyone wants to pull out," says Hradec Bek before the match of the 5th extra-league round.
Hradec Králové will try to extend its winning streak, which currently includes three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen came on Sunday the most appreciated by fans, Mountfield went to neighboring Pardubice.
"But we can't watch the games as they were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now, and play in them as well, if not better, "says the Hradec defender.
Hradec should not even look back at last year's balance with Sparta. They lost three of the four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, the Sparta management brought several significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what we will say, this year they are really charged," admits Nedomlel before the first match at the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Trinec.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoin and does not know what to do with it
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It is responding to an instruction from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoin and ether to the central bank and then pay the oil firm's suppliers with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now near 30-year lows. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
The sanctions that the United States has imposed on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro have largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This further deepened the economic crisis in the country. The current crisis is one of the most serious in the world, which has forced officials to use a mixture of different ways to move money. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state-owned cryptocurrency have failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperate the government is to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither the Central Bank of Venezuela nor PDVSA responded to a request for comment.
It's unclear how PDVSA got its own bitcoins and ethers, or how much value these currencies own. The business has difficulty obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels, because large banks are not willing to do business with entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the $700 million ($16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties struggled to find financial institutions to make the transaction possible.
PDVSA may not be willing to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market because it would require it to register on an exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, he wants the central bank to use the cryptocurrency and use it to pay for those to whom PDVSA owes. Oil officials believe the central bank is less exposed to potential obstacles to paying with cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin and Ether use a decentralized online ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of the money laundering and customer information issues that are associated with them and complicate compliance.
After the 2018 debacle, cryptocurrencies are making a comeback this year on expectations of greater institutional adoption and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen nearly 20 percent in the past four days, but has gained about 130 percent since the start of the year.
Neckermann cancels all flights, five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s.r.o., operating under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, has not filed an insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the scheduled departures of its clients," he added, adding that this currently applies to all departures from September 26 to October 6.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. Neckermann's 800 clients who are currently abroad "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic is assured by their scheduled flights," he said.
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In this case, it is necessary for clients to immediately contact the SOS line of CK Neckermann," added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook's collapse occurred on Monday. In August this year, the tour operator struck a deal under which creditors were to deposit £900 million into the company.
Half of the sum was to be obtained from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. Based on this, it was to become the majority owner. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, on September 20, it was reported that creditors had demanded that the tour operator obtain a £200 million reserve or the deal would collapse. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Under a bridge, someone killed a non-conflicting homeless woman. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague Police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening to the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police call for possible testimony relates.
"One of the drivers who drove on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on Pod Krejcárkem Street could have filmed the murderer, for example, on a dash cam. Perhaps a witness could only have seen him and described him. In short, we welcome any testimony on this case and accept it on line 158," said Jan Daněk, spokesman for the Regional Police Directorate.
According to Danek's spokesman, the murdered homeless woman was non-conflicting, did not drink alcohol and did not seek the company of other people. The woman lived at the crime scene. "Most often she moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, where she had large blue shopping bags with her," Danek added a description of the victim, which could also help potential witnesses.
Slovaks succeeded, they will only pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for racism of fans. The national team was originally supposed to play the European Championship qualification match with Wales without spectators, but instead the union will only pay a fine of 15,000 euros (about 387,000 crowns).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of fans during the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting team of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2: 1. Both unions were closed for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000 and Hungary €67,000.
After the appeal, the Slovaks were only fined 15,000 euros for insulting political chants. The next match of the national team in the qualification for the European Championship with Wales on October 10 in Trnava will be made available to fans.
Basketball players did not reach the medal from the World Championship under 17, finished fourth
The third World Seventeen Championship was also won by the Americans, who defeated Spain in the final narrowly 77:75 despite 40 points of the Spaniard Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the beginning, but we could not keep it because they overwhelmed us under the basket, "regretted captain Karolína Malečková. "But playing in front of such an audience was an incredible experience," she praised the fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, thanks to two threes they took an 8-0 lead and dominated the entire first quarter on the court. At that moment, it seemed that the opponents will repay the defeat from the group stage 85:88 after overtime. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary get back into the game with a 12-2 run.
"I'm convinced that all we had to do was score two or three more baskets, run to 20 points and we wouldn't let go. But instead, our mistakes came. I am not interested in the referees, but in what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch, "said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't let anything go and they fought to the end. But the opponent was very good," he added.
The Czechs were held in the game especially by Petra Holešínská with accurate shooting from distance and pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the best Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and missed a large part of the third quarter on the court. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they maintained, although the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us, the first five games were very difficult, we turned games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of energy. Already against Spain you could see that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of the physicality, we weren't consistent defensively. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we lacked rebounding. And the Hungarians are so good that if you don't combine everything together, it's hard to win," Fousek added.
He believes that a promising future awaits his charge. "In two years, the girls managed to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the European Sixteen-year-Old Championships and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with good character and it is necessary to continue working with it and develop talent. Now it is up to the federation which coach to assign them in higher categories, "added Fousek.
The end of political newsagents? Critics say the new law won't help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to encourage ministers to absolve themselves of responsibility for the election while continuing to choose their candidates.
Greater transparency in selection procedures for positions in state-owned companies is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 MEPs voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, KSČM, Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before a government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation for the minister binding. In the end, it failed.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will play into the hands of ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind a decision of the commission and thus will not have clear transparent responsibility," SPD chairman Tomio Okamura said. ODS Vice-Chairman Martin Kupka speaks similarly.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include clean criminal record, indebtedness, a minimum age of 25 years and expertise should be the main selection criterion.
The bill will still have to pass the Senate, and then the president will sign it.
Tough competition for the Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed bets on rich equipment, at what price?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It clearly belongs to the compact SUV, but does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves the larger sibling Sportage, which is such a direct answer to cars such as the Skoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. In comparison, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which, by sloping the rear, can remotely resemble the world of the SUV coupé, which is especially popular in this part of the market among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, XCeed can not be classified only alongside plastic versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so who does not want to, Ceed in the shapes of the novelty may not even see.
Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed estate, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so do not expect a basic atmospheric fourteenhundred. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged litre and also offers a turbocharged sixteen hundred with 150 kW, reserved for the GT version of its siblings. Don't expect a sports grade here. The 1.6 CRDi turbodiesels are only available in mild-hybrid versions, which means that the combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps to reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon, the offer will expand to include a plug-in hybrid, a variant that travels about sixty kilometers on electricity alone. The batteries can then be charged from a normal socket.
Simona Krainová: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucie Bílá!
The day before the launch of the Fuck The Age calendar, Simona Krainová posted her last photos of herself completely naked! "I was a little afraid that people would judge me for taking pictures of myself naked at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far I have only positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, it is possible to have a solid figure even at the age of 46. Of course, there is hard work and self-denial behind it, but there is no other way."
"With Lukáš Dvořák we took about three thousand photos, selected about a hundred, and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest are still waiting for their time. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," the model, who came to her christening very revealed, told Blesk.
She had an elongated jacket from Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they were not visible, so it looked like she had forgotten her underpants. Daily jogging has strengthened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so pleased with the success that she kissed everyone she met at the baptism. Husband, friends, even Slavice Lucie Bílá.
The car tuner brought the voice of the digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, says the headline of a long piece written by Michael Hobbes for the Huffington Post and photographed by Finlay Mackay. A provocative explanation then says that for decades, the medical community ignored the facts about obesity and waged a merciless (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people that not only scarred public opinion, but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes says at the outset is that there is often a very long and tedious road from knowing and knowing the facts to putting it into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, when some captains as early as the seventeenth century distributed lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the belief that this would prevent disease. However, the British Navy abandoned this practice due to concerns about increased costs. The clear influence of fruit in the prevention and treatment of disease was demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the Navy to take this into account. Even seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but they did not become mandatory until the sixties, just as the first confirmed death from asbestos dates back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every public health discovery—no matter how significant—has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of being overweight or obese. More Americans today live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and HIV combined.
Obesity is seen as a highly personal failure of an individual who is said to burden health care and reduce GDP. The fear of thickness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet subsequently gain more weight than they have lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes goes on to describe the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. Personal meets systemic here, for example, at faculties when teaching future doctors devotes only 19 hours of the entire study to the issue of nutrition. Which at a time when the 60 process of calories Americans ingests comes from ultra-processed food — that is, overly processed food.
How obesity is stigmatized is illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people tend to experience shorter check-ups, doctors treat them with less empathy, and consider them more problematic patients.
Since 1980, the proportion of obesity has doubled in 73 countries and increased in 113 countries. And in that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.
Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of ticket prices rising
The most expensive item is the listing fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno at the Grand Prix spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the registration fee," economist Petr Pelc said.
According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors from abroad as well. For Brno, it is as important as, for example, Tuřany Airport or the Exhibition Centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- Profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money for the organization, increasing listing fee for the Dorna promoter company
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- Current status: negotiations on a new contract for the organization of races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money from public budgets for other matters. But to some extent, this is a political issue, not an economic one," he said.
In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher. There is a variant of increasing the listing fee to almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organization of the race. If the worst scenarios come true, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the region to pay the amount," admitted Mayor of Brno Markéta Vaňková.
As Deník Rovnost has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that advertising must be placed in places that are not occupied by cameras. The choice of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the second sponsor cannot be a company from the same area," Vaňková explained.
Organizers can also get more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets accordingly," said Petr Vokřál, an opposition councillor for the ANO movement and former mayor.
D5 accident: Truck collision closes motorway
The incident was reported around 08:00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight traffic. Passenger cars can go through the gas station," police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. According to Richterová, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, and the cause of the accident is being investigated by police.
Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian firefighters, said one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other was transporting plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were shifted, which the firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. Firefighters managed to pump out another 200 litres. Employees of the environmental department of the Beroun town hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak. The rescue of crashed vehicles and the passage of the highway was provided by a private company, which also excavated contaminated soil.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková was eliminated in the 800 meters and the pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and the hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, which surprised her two years ago in London, did not pass the qualification.
Hurdler Vít Müller will also take part in the heat on Friday and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.
Šafránková threw 65.46 meters in her third attempt and fell almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.
Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the international federation IAAF, finished in the fourth heat in the penultimate sixth place and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to advance to the semifinals. She was one and a half seconds behind her best this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the corner, which took away my strength. It seemed to me that I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start again, so it was a bit uncomfortable in this one. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was glad to have overtaken at least one opponent in the home straight. "She really wasn't doing well, so every beaten opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie Nanyondo of Uganda in 2:00.36.
Doha is missing the best eight-hundred-year-old Caster Semenya of South Africa, who has too much testosterone in her body but, like some other runners, refuses treatment mandated by IAAF rules since this year.
In the heats of the 100 meters, the number one favorite was confirmed by American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 as the only one got under ten seconds. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is seeking to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semifinals. Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is number two in this year's standings with a performance of 9.86, was expected to fight Coleman, who has a 9.81 this season.
Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría showed great form already in the qualification of long-distance runners, who flew to a distance of 840 cm with his first jump. No athlete has jumped this far in the World Cup qualification in the last 20 years. The twenty-one-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with a performance of 865 cm.
French Oscar nominee Les Misérables will launch Be2Can
The Golden Bear and both winners of acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the Best Director Award and the Jury Prize from Cannes and much more will present the 6th edition of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. Once again this year, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and challenging presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the filmmaker Ladj Ly took the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The pre-premiere of the film in Prague will be personally introduced by the representatives of the two main roles of the police officers of the criminal unit, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-writer of the film.
Be2Can will take place this year in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, as well as in Brno (Art Cinema), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
Director Ladj Ly's directorial feature debut was screened and awarded at a number of other international festivals after its success in Cannes. It won Best Film and Best Screenplay at the Durban IFF, was screened at the Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo IFFs and will soon be screened in San Sebastián.
As part of the festival, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, System Disruptor, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We Didn't Catch You, Ghost Town Anthology and At the Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph The Painted Bird.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
A vote in Canada's upper house of parliament has confirmed a well-known rumor for days: Canada is stripping honorary citizenship of former legend of the struggle for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Myanmar), who spent years under house arrest for trying to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title for her role in genocide against the minority Rohingya people.
The decision to take away Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved a week ago by the lower legislature and senators have now unanimously backed it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," said independent senator Ratna Omidvar. "We must make it clear that complices in genocide are not welcome here in Canada – especially as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The longtime human rights activist's silence on the atrocities that the Buddhist-majority Myanmar army has been committing against the Rohingya Muslim minority for months is intolerable.
The fact that officially organised genocide is taking place in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the government there - has utterly failed in her duty to protect her citizens was recently revealed by a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigative team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that, the report says, "shock both in the enormity of their actions and on a massive scale." According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her led administration were primarily complicit in covering up the actions of the soldiers and unleashing a protective fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation".
Five personalities remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shia Muslims, and Malala Yousafzai.
The Canadian Museum of Human Rights also reflected developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy, where Suu Kyi's profile was updated with information about atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to strip her of the title of honorary citizen. "We have also dimmed the illumination of her photo on a tableau showing a timeline of the struggle for human rights and are thinking about replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," museum spokesman Rorie McLeod said in a statement.
The only thing that will remain in the current upheaval for Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for her huge contribution to the struggle for democracy. "While Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensen told CBS Canada.
Microplastics have reached human guts, study confirms for first time
Scientists have confirmed several years of suspicion. A team led by University of Vienna professor Philipp Schwabl has published a study that proves for the first time the presence of microplastics in human faeces. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - but tiny plastic particles measuring between 50 and 500 micrometers were found in samples of all subjects. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food wrapped in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are produced by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and soft drinks; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the human digestive tract has only been officially confirmed. There were about 20 particles of microplastics per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.
Of course, both lay and scientific awareness suspect that this is not good. But humanity still doesn't know how bad it is — and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can get into the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind and has confirmed what we have long thought. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we need to continue to investigate what exactly it means for human health," Schwabl says.
It is known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune responses of the digestive system, facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far, there is no other solution than to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But that will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will be to at least stem its steep rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more than today. The current pace is a whopping million bottles bought per minute. Every year, around eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some countries have already adopted restrictions and other measures, for example Kenya - under the threat of draconian penalties - has banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering minor bans (well-known straws), and the Czech Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. But critics argue that such measures, while nice, are totally inadequate.
Harry follows in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in that she knew how to grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused an uproar when she visited Africa and a minefield in particular. Images of him wearing a protective suit and face shield have become iconic. And no one could have guessed that a few months later the princess of human hearts would breathe her last in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry has also scored when he went to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to a mine clearance post in Dirico, Angola, also wearing a special protective suit and looking very thoughtful. He certainly couldn't help but think of his beloved mother, whom he lost when he was just 13 years old.
Harry gave a speech on the spot where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to defuse minefields and other explosives in war-torn countries. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them up, we can help the community find the peace that comes with opportunities," he said, calling for saving and preserving wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopaedic centre after his famous mum, Princess Diana.
"The Duke is honoured to visit a place and community that was so important to his mother, learn about their tireless mission and speak out to all those who [Diana] felt most needed to be heard, even if the issue wasn't popular worldwide," Sussex Royal said in an Instagram post.
Royal fans may regret that he didn't take his wife Meghan, 38, and their son Archie, 4 months, on such a quest to remember Diana. The two have had separate schedules towards Harry since Wednesday, apparently for their protection. After all, taking a small baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to jeopardize his beloved family at any cost.
Singles. We don't have a certain reproduction, but we don't have to scare
Some words have unfortunate connotations, even if they only convey the state of affairs. These include the word "only child". It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," they say, without needing anything to add. Interestingly, the "only child" has carried this trait since ancient times, from a time when terms such as demographic crisis were not widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is required to ensure simple reproduction. It is also widely known that no country in Europe today reaches this value. At most, France or Sweden come close, but European countries do not have a simple rate of population reproduction. (Within the West, only Israel stands out, with a total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation made for alarmism. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Maláčová also falls for it: "There are almost as many only children as two-child families," she said in an interview for LN. But she forgot the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good to draw attention to the problem instead of downplaying or ideologizing it. Like in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "so Hitler supported it"). It is good to remember that many couples are planning only children. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to these decisions (for example, the weak spread of teleworking discourages women from further pregnancies). But despite all this, let us point out one thing.
When Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many only children", there is a drop of demagoguery in it. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us recall that fertility in the Czech Republic was last ensured by simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). It then fell to a menacing 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is the European average. It is not enough for simple reproduction, so the action of politicians is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can they reduce a little.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. For starters, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 – a feat that is what many countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.
According to the official tourism organization, about 95 percent of its energy already comes from renewable sources – in 2017, Costa Rica ran on it for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.
Forest density also contributes to reducing emissions. The rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region and around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot given the small size of the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rainforests, cloud forests, coral reefs and mangrove marshes are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and several rescue stations for sloths.
Kindly to the planet. Researchers' Night begins in Prague
"I would definitely visit CTU in Prague and look at a model of how smart cities will look. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, which is not otherwise open to the public," advises the national coordinator of the Night of Scientists Jitřenka Navrátilová.
The Department of Anatomy offers a tour of the dissection room and the opportunity to try working with surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to CULS and watch the film Green Desert," Navratilova adds. Guided tours will also be offered by nine laboratories. The motto of this year's Night of Scientists is "friendly to the planet".
Attorney General renewed prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of the mother, who manipulated her daughter for a long time and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, but Zeman disagrees. Such conduct, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court, can be considered a criminal offense.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of maltreatment can also be considered necessary in terms of directing further application practice," Zeman's appeal reads.
Last year, the District Court in Svitavy first found the woman guilty of abusing a person in her care and endangering the upbringing of a child. She formed a strong, almost symbiotic bond with her daughter, even in a situation where she was to be entrusted to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative attitude towards the father. The situation affected the emotional development of her daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to harm herself if handed over to her father.
The Svitavy court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it was not a crime. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered it to rule again.
The Regional Court stated that situations in which one parent manipulates a child against the other are by no means exceptional. It is dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or youth social protection authorities. Only rarely is criminal law a solution.
According to the Attorney General, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangering her upbringing. "The accused acted quite deliberately by arousing negative feelings towards her father in her daughter and deliberately reinforcing these negative emotions. By such conduct, she not only pursued an unlawful intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must necessarily have been aware that this would cause negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal states.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court once again. It follows from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.
Resign, Czernin called on Schiller for speaking about opposition filth
"I find it completely unacceptable that a member of the Czech government anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament, would use such totalitarian expressions," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schillerová.
Her words caused a stir during the discussion of the draft constitutional charge against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the draft constitutional prosecution that the Senate came up with was thrown off the table by the deputies.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There is not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages such as how taxpayers' money is spent here, how empty straws are being beaten here. And I even dare to quote one of them: It's opposition and senatorial scum," the finance minister said.
"These terms were used by the Nazis to refer to citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists to their political opponents. It is totalitarian rhetoric, without a shred of respect for man and opinion," TOP 09 deputy chairwoman Czernin, who will compete for the post of party chairwoman in the autumn with the current first vice-chairwoman Markéta Pekarová Adamová, wrote to the minister.
"I quoted one of the many reports I received dozens of times during the proceedings of the House. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal denunciation that we witness daily in domestic politics and which was also the main motive of Thursday's meeting of the Chamber of Deputies. The fact that someone applies the term to themselves surprises me," Schillerová told the Czech News Agency.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession were accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students of Ayotzinapa University disappeared, but despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been clarified. Reportedly, the students were detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It's unclear exactly what happened next, but the investigation said the students apparently ended up in the hands of a local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, according to APTN.
A memorial procession was held in Mexico City on Thursday, with families wanting to express frustration that they were still unable to find answers and explain their children's disappearance.
However, the relatively peaceful march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals who destroyed everything in their path. Vandals destroyed shops and hotels, did not shy away from destroying monuments, set fires around the city and broke windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything he could to apprehend and asked the public for any information that would lead to clarification of the case.
More than 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but none of them were convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, and interrogators allegedly tortured suspects.
Mahulena Bočanová interrupted her year-long detox and sins again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bočanová confided to Blesk that she had quit drinking. "During the holidays, I told myself that I would give my old battered fifty-year-old body a breather. I gave myself a deadline forever. I feel terribly rested, I have a lot of energy and, most importantly, my psyche has improved. I haven't been doing well mentally lately. I wake up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, more money."
A year of abstinence was enough and the actress again found her way to alcohol. "Sometimes I have bubbles or good wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I have one drink and have fun until morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also liked non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," said Mahulena, who is still paired with Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will now join the series Ordinace v růžové zahrada (Surgery in the Rose Garden). "I'm ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was overtelling. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He wishes him peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) is not afraid of any question. In his show Call and Write to the Boss, he publicly comments on various topics. And he is no stranger to tabloid cases, which he comments on in a sparkling and witty way. Although this time he was not laughing.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing.
"You know, Karel got sick and said it fairly, without tabloid journalists having to poke around. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And of course, I would wish him a successful treatment and especially peace! The peace he needs now," said the owner of Barrandov TV.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And she waited for the news that the Master himself decided to give to the media. I don't even like the various expressions of what his old friends and various celebrities think about his health. And on behalf of our media, I can say that we will pay attention to his illness and his person only if he is interested. I think other media should consider a similar approach."
Young Czechs think they can do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"It turns out that young Czechs have somewhat more confidence in their knowledge of finance than reality. In this case, women and respondents without a high school diploma had a significantly higher proportion of bad answers," said KRUK director Jaroslava Palendalová.
Men and young high school students or college students are more likely to trust their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the Internet (23 percent) and only in third place from teaching at school (21 percent).
Women in particular consult their parents on financial issues, while men are more likely to seek information on the Internet. Obtaining information about finances from parents is prevalent in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications have practically minimal influence.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent the authority in all major areas of life, is shown. Therefore, the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is crucial," Palendalová said.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 percent of young people.
Young people clearly face the question of whether it is better to save and buy, for example, your own house or apartment, or to enjoy and spend money, without savings and your own housing.
The strategy of saving and investing in tangible fixed assets is professed by 94 percent of respondents. This applies across all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The strategy of investigation is then fully advocated by married people with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income over CZK 30,000 a month want to enjoy.
The hunter was injured in a fall from a sitting position, he was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before half past eight in the evening in the top parts of the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very difficult and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked the Emergency Medical Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region for cooperation. The paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the hunter in a selected location with multiple injuries. He was treated immediately and then gently but with difficulty transported on a so-called Austrian cart through impassable terrain.
"The transport of about one and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaskovsky, the authorized chief of the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service and at the same time an intervening rescuer, the hunter's colleague was fortunately able to describe in detail where the injured person was.
"So we found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Záchranka application on his phone, our rescuers would certainly have been with him sooner and at the same time the dispatching center of line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation immediately," noted Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the Záchranka app activated should be commonplace in the mountains today.
Zeman as a conservationist - A man stretching the constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who move in a camp-divided society and do not want to go completely crazy will welcome situations where they do not have to cheer only for their own. When he can admit pluses even to the one he otherwise criticizes. If only so that he does not feel that he is oriented only by pre-assigned labels. Such situations include a list of heavily damaged monuments that President Zeman fencing on his favorite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it is. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic can see many of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farms - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagoguery can come into play here, too. That if we reproach the town hall for not taking care of monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized building whose owner is not traceable. The head of state calls on local politicians: "A section of the Heritage Act allows you to fine property owners who do not take care of their property." But even if the owner is unreachable, it must be admitted that the president calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the Constitution should acknowledge as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause, like the squatters, whom he himself does not recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the insults, the squatters draw attention to a problem that is beyond the current interest. That this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's admit that the president is de facto doing the same thing.
If you come to the historical center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov celebrates 500 years of silver mining and minting of thalers (dollars for Americans). Why? Apparently because of the quick-fermented sale of houses in the 90s, local officials say. But why is it that Ostrov, seven kilometres away, the seat of the Šliks, who minted the Jáchymov thalers, has a nicely repaired historical centre? It is good that the President draws attention to these things.
Babiš called for security cooperation at memorial to victims of terror
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited the September 11, 2019, Ground Zero Memorial to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all the states of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said this today at the New York memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honoured the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very touching place," said the Prime Minister when, accompanied by his wife Monika, he placed a white rose next to the names of Lukáš Rambousek and Czechoslovak émigré Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2750 dead killed in the hijacked plane attack on the former twin World Trade Center skyscrapers. The WTC towers collapsed after the impact, and in their place there is now a memorial with a list of victims' names.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babis said. The attack on the US on September 11, 2001, was described by the Prime Minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. In addition to destroying the World Trade Center skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed a hijacked plane into the Defense Department building in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, possibly the White House or Congress. The plane crashed when the passengers confronted the hijackers.
"This is our main enemy, where all countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.
Slovenia also beat Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championship
Slovenian volleyball players will sensationally play for the premiere title of European champions. With the support of nearly 12,000 boisterous fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions Poland beat Poland 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team looked much more compact than the Polish world champions in the semifinals. They belonged only to the beginning of the opening set and with luck the end of the second set, but the home volleyball players overcame themselves in defense and of the players in the red and white jersey basically scored only the native of Cuba León.
However, in the home line-up, both smashers Čebulj and Urnaut presented themselves in the form of life, as well as the second universal Štern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini. The Poles paid for the fact that they had won all the previous matches at this Euro masterfully, while the Slovenians were gaining confidence after tough battles in the playoffs with the Bulgarians and Russians.
With the Poles this August, Slovenia lost in the Olympic qualification in Gdansk 1: 3, but they returned the defeat at home. Now, however, Stožica will leave the sold-out Ljubljana Arena. After today, however, they have a second medal in history, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the European Championship four years ago.
At the previous European Championship, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Tech companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama has been somewhat baked by history. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, the political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: "What we may be witnessing... is the final point in the ideological development of mankind and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the ultimate form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are witnessing illiberal models from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism flourishing. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to balance these forces. As his interview with George Eaton to the New Statesman shows, he reconsiders many of his former positions: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be returned to the public square, and Marx was right about many things. At the same time, he insists that his intellectual development is still in line with the position of the nineties, and critics of The End of History and the Last Man have misunderstood it.
"What I was saying then was that one of the problems with modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracy does not even try to define what the good life is. It leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the point, and therefore group together according to their identity, which gives them a sense of belonging."
In its time, The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists, who saw communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked how he now perceives the rise of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when clear public services are in demand, I do not think that will work. But if you mean redistributive programs that attempt to address the huge imbalances in income and wealth that we are witnessing, then yes. I think not only could he come back, he should come back. The long period that President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher started, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came into play, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
Finally, Fukuyama tries to calm the current situation and warns all liberals that even the emergence of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Soldiers practice, pull down the curtains. China is preparing celebrations at the site of the massacre
The Army has been rehearsing the parade over recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close their curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the vacated streets to the square, and warplanes circled the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud their country would display its military might. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other states.
She was apparently referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where elections are looming. But they may also be concerned in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, where thousands of people have repeatedly demonstrated against the Chinese-appointed administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside Beijing. The southern Chinese port of Xiamen performed a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen lies opposite the island of Taiwan and is among the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of prohibited things is growing. There are already drones, balloons, kites, alcohol, walkie-talkies and devices using radio waves, The Guardian reported. He added that Weibo, China's popular social network, was deleting "harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (in charge) against all predictions," said Maura Cunningham, a historian who studies China. "This is a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was created in 1949 when the Communists led by Mao Zedong won a battle against Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists, who had retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 60s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime massacred thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators, both students and workers, with tanks in Tiananmen Square.
Since the late 70s, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
Czechs or children are not allowed to enter. CTIA detected discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, incorrect price reporting and non-compliance with the principles of fair sales.
In one case, discrimination refuses to allow smaller children into a restaurant in Prague. "When asked electronically by a consumer whether it is possible to order a table for four adults and one child aged four in the restaurant, the restaurant employee electronically replied that they do not accept the presence of children under eight years of age in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.
In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speakers to the table, while allowing English-speaking people to do so. "The Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of consumers, were not allowed to sit down at a table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," the CTIA spokesperson described the situation.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. Since they have not yet been finalized, a spokesman for the inspectorate could not provide further information about the restaurants in question.
However, discrimination occurred only in a very small proportion of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it detected other misconduct in 64 cases. Most of these were deficiencies in compliance with the principles of fair selling and failure to inform consumers about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
On Wednesday, the inspectorate reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged amounts higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been imposed.
On holiday only with a credit card? NEO account offers free withdrawals from ATMs worldwide!
According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include, in particular, comfort, security, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travelers in almost all corners of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but nowadays credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to repeatedly go to exchange cash to exchange money. And even "holidaymakers" do not want to rely on the fact that cash will suffice. In addition, Czech banks or bureaux de change do not even have some foreign currencies. With the NEO account, we have therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash free of charge from all ATMs, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Marketing and Communication Director and Spokesperson of Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing your money than cash. When losing a full wallet, its owner may not wait for the money he carried in it. However, if they only lose their payment card, they can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. By acting quickly, they do not have to suffer any financial loss at all. "Keeping money in a bank account has other advantages besides its reliable protection. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit a branch. In addition, the money on the bank account is insured up to EUR 100,000 and the account maintenance is completely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone planning to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility to arrange it and pay by card online, it can be done even at the last minute. However, just owning a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, with the MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business embossed cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they are travelling. This often eliminates any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it's always a good idea to check the scope of the insurance, i.e. whether it covers all activities travellers plan to take.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. Head of the children's clinic builds an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today only a few people recognize that she is a foreigner.
There are hundreds of medical students from abroad studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. The paediatric clinic in Prague's Motol district tried to get some of them.
In order for Tara Hussein Tayeb to arrive at the Motol hospital in Prague around five o'clock in the afternoon, she had to get up a lot. A Kurdish woman with short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimaniah, a city in northeastern Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and in the afternoon treats small patients as part of a private practice. In addition, he teaches at the university.
Spilková in pair. In Indianapolis, he is on the verge of promotion after the first round
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of advancing to the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship tournament in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys and finished the opening day at par. With a score of 72, he is tied for 69th, which is the expected cut.
Twenty-four-year-old Spilková returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month health break and did not make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She rested due to fatigue and exhaustion after a previous illness.
The first Czech winner of a professional tournament at the European LET Series is a member of the LPGA Tour for the first year and so far she has not been very successful. Out of twelve tournaments, she made the cut three times, her best being 32nd in Hawaii. He is fighting to keep his card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was played best by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, she has a score of -9 and a two-shot lead over three opponents.
Prague Stock Exchange Grows Slightly, with Czech Banks, O2 and Avast doing well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight increase. The PX index rose by 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was pulled up by Czech banks, the telecommunications company O2 and the technology company Avast. On the other hand, Austrian titles and the media company CME did not do well. This results from the results of trading on the exchange's website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in slightly positive territory and eventually ended with a small profit. "Nevertheless, it (the PX index) lost slightly over one percent for the whole week," said Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks have partially corrected the declines of recent days. Komerční banka rose by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares appreciated by 0.89 percent to CZK 113 and operator O2 gained 0.46 percent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Less than one percent was acquired by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640.
Securities of the energy company ČEZ stagnated at 520 crowns on Thursday.
Three titles were loss-making - Erste Bank lost 0.87 percent to 779.20 crowns, CME 0.73 percent to 109 crowns and insurance VIG 0.40 percent to 618 crowns.
The koruna weakened slightly against both major world currencies. On the euro it lost four hellers to CZK 25.85 / EUR, on the dollar three hellers to CZK 23.62 / USD. This is the result of data on the server Patria Online.
My heart is like a bell and the lungs of a non-smoker. I'll just have a few infusions, Zeman joked
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, doctors did not find any "morbid states" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
Doctors at the president's check-up revealed mild signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused by insufficient hydration. "To fix the dehydration of the body, I take several infusions that get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the Central Committee stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". In this context, the president mentioned that Zavoral received several hateful messages because of the health check.
According to the president, doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on his body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean as if he were not a smoker, the liver works as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are also fine and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of the iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about his health.
The issue of Zeman's health became a topic especially during last year's presidential election or during some public appearances during which Zeman has obvious problems with walking. According to Prague Castle, the president is walking badly because of diabetic multifunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low blood pressure and has difficulty hearing. For the sake of his health, he cut down on smoking.
Scientists are looking for toddlers with a birth defect called valgosity of the ankles for their study
Valgosity (misalignment) of the ankles is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. Normally, it is treated with intense exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy babies and children with a diagnosis to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will not have any risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimunová, head of research at the Faculty of Sports Studies MU.
Parents of both groups of children can register for the study via the website, where the registration form and all information are available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear medical shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should register their child is when they take their first independent steps, typically letting go of the furniture they hold onto when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each lasting about 20 minutes, and for half of the participants, it also includes wearing the shoes tested," says Gimová.
Pike in a pond or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is seventh in the world), low unemployment rate, low state debt. Or the fact that our country is twenty-fourth out of 140 evaluated countries in terms of quality of life, according to a recent study.
However, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit also presented other, far from "rosy" data. For example, the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction proceedings. It may happen that the current economic "boom" will not leave any significant architectural legacy as it did in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only existing legislation, but also slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic significantly lags behind developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, but people with an improving standard of living will also want to have a place to live, travel in a modern and fast way, have high-quality cultural sites, and live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible for years to complete the inner and outer ring road or to build a high-speed railway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally courageous national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd scramble for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".
And when it seems that something bolder could succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by conservationists or other somewhat obstinate associations or politicians. In the absurd drama around the "blob" of Jan Kaplický designed for the new building of the National Library, even President Václav Klaus wanted to tie himself to the excavators.
However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network or start building high-speed trains, so Germany finally decided to lead its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by a "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs of existing infrastructure are sometimes drowned in the šlendrian. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is now a puzzle.
Babiš came to politics with a promise to "arrange things". But not much has happened when it comes to making meaningful investments and accelerating cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. Although an amendment to the Act on the Acceleration of Transport Infrastructure Construction has been in force since 2018, we will have to wait for more extensive positive impacts, such as easier land expropriation. And the new Building Act, approved by the government, which should supposedly shorten the current average length of building proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will come into force from 2021, if we are lucky. But many people probably wouldn't bet on it.
Uncombed wants 45 million from the state
The Ministry of Justice, according to spokesman Vladimír Řepka, has received six applications in this connection so far and is now analysing them. The young man was sentenced to two years in prison for assaulting a woman, but the justice system eventually acquitted him.
Both Supreme State Prosecutor Pavel Zeman and Minister of Justice Marie Benešová did not file an appeal in the case.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradec Public Prosecutor's Office charged the then twenty-year-old grammar school student Nečesaný with it. The prosecution claimed that he hit the woman several times on the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, and her life was saved by the doctors of the Hradec hospital.
Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I am innocent and I swear on it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he was in the hairdresser's on the fateful day, told the court. Apparently he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after his wife told him he was already closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later identified Nečesaný as the attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradec Regional Court handed down five verdicts in the case. First, Nečesaný was twice found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in prison, but the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed, he gradually went to jail twice, but each time he was released after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After the ordered change of the bench, there were repeated acquittals, the last of which was upheld by the High Court in March this year.
However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the justification of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but given the procedural situation, he could not have had a better option. He said he had dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but an assessment of it. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was gathered in the pre-trial proceedings, which would be amply sufficient for a guilty verdict in another criminal case," Lněnicka said.
However, Hradec and the Supreme Court looked at the case differently and their opinion would probably not be changed by further cancellation of the acquittal.
Epilepsy complicated his love for sports, thanks to the operation he has new hope
For the first time, Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always stared into space for a few minutes, became immobilized and did not react to anyone. The paediatrician therefore sent him to a children's neurological clinic, where, after a series of examinations, doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy and immediately put him on medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs, thanks to which he completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors stopped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, however, he had another seizure and everything started all over again.
Doctors again tried different combinations of drugs, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences were constantly repeated. Since Honza always stopped perceiving during a seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding a bike and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skis and a snowboard. Although sport gave him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him all the time to help in case of emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to experts at the Motol University Hospital. After a series of examinations, local doctors concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery, which would remove a bearing from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to have 2 surgeries in a row, first the doctors inserted probes into my brain that scanned its activity, then they could remove the bearing. It was hell for me for several weeks. I just had to lie down and hardly move, wires that were connected to the computer were sticking out of my head," recalls Honza.
The operation was successful and the doctors removed the relatively extensive bearing. "The first days after the operation were very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Compared to how lively and communicative he is normally, it was a terrible change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," says the mother and adds: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to doctors it happens. Since then, she has been 3 months seizure-free."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started to cooperate with Society E, with which he travels to schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is slowly returning to sport. "I'm learning how to do sports properly, how to breathe well so as not to expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, he will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI Boating Triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet, which takes place this weekend on September 28, 2019 at the Veselská pískovna. But next year, perhaps, it will.
XXX Lutz can buy rival Kiko, the authority allowed. But there is a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Competition has approved, subject to the fulfilment of structural commitments set out in favour of maintaining effective competition, the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other," said Martin Švanda, spokesman for the Office for the Protection of Competition.
XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it also absorbed the Kika chain, it would occupy too large a part of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, he has to sell part of the purchased company.
XLCEE-Holding also acquires Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, the transaction must be approved by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. It faced problems when it discovered discrepancies in its accounts. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk, Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner has the brand Möbelix. Following the takeover of Kika's foreign subsidiaries, XXX Lutz will operate over 300 stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is EUR 4.4 billion (about CZK 114 billion).
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with an exhibition of manuscripts
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and on Saturday in Prague's Klementinum. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the precious originals in display cases in the Chapel of Mirrors. Admission to the exhibition is free, it is open both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents entitled Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and Library of Wenceslas IV was prepared by the library together with the National Archives. The National Archives look at the written heritage from the time of the reign of Wenceslas IV from the perspective of official documents and the National Library from the perspective of literary works, said its author, Jan Vojtíšek.
"Visitors can look forward to, for example, the work on agriculture by Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or the breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictine nuns of the monastery of St. Peter. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he enumerated the reasons why people should look at the exhibition.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the opening miniature H (enrico) depicts the semi-figure of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Wenceslas IV Bible, also participated in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see a Latin collection of tracts by John Wycliffe from the period from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book from the library of Wenceslas IV has been preserved in the Czech territory. According to experts, this library was one of the largest and most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at that time, because the young king longed to build a representative library that would be equal to the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library ceased to exist soon after Václav's death. Apparently it was stolen or destroyed during the Hussite conquest of the castle. However, several codices were saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made accessible to the public live, and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said Martin Kocanda, director of the National Library.
On Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition called What is hidden under the floor, which presents local archaeological discoveries, will be opened free of charge in Klementinum.

Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! She grew younger in her fair hair
The film's Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her life anniversary in November, she has never looked like a pensioner. And now she has helped it. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who would have her hair interwoven with gray color, wore sedentary things and went out sporadically. She has always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can relax in her view of her image.
Fortunately, she did not succumb to the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with the help of good old indulona. And her anti-wrinkle recipe is paying off. But now she's changed her hair color and she's completely peeked through.
When she came to the social event where celebrities were saying goodbye to summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did her hair be lighter and shorter, but she was also dressed in a yellow jacket that made her even brighter.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate that even on the threshold of seventy they can take risks with appearance. And it paid off for Petra, she looks fifty at most.
