Parliament did not support the amendment acquitting Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko was convicted as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The amendment, which would have opened the way to the acquittal of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected by MPs during the second reading of the proposal to reduce sentences for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the court is to hear the convict's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict a political vendetta against the regime, and suspicions of bias in the court have also sparked the trial in the West.
The proposal to remove Article 365, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 MPs during the vote.
It needed 226 votes to pass.
Libyan Victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, the Islamists will win the elections, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has subscribed to customary Sharia law, and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as theft is punished.
Women can forget about emancipation, any apostates from the faith will be executed, and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and would probably not suit the aforementioned Libyans.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters took the help from infidel dogs.
They are only excused by the fact that, in their view, it was not some American general who directed the NATO airstrikes, but Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every successful intervention.
So, when winners are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in a firefight, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of a dictator without guaranteeing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
Thus, the locals do not have the problem of expelling the "crusaders".
But without the occupation of the oil companies, will they have Libyan black gold for a mouthful?
They may not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless we are prevented by those followers of Sharia law.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have come under the radar of investors
A statistical whirlwind swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated quarter-on-quarter, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is now breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries revised data for the second quarter, in which Germany did better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of 0.1%), while France reported that it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated quarter-on-quarter and, according to the CZSO, confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Highlights
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarter-on-year.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data.
The economies of both the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising towards critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are also starting to feel the problems...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate promotion for 200 million
The football team has mastered the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to a great Czech and a beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček, they won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from the home rematch and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the home frustration in the end, the great Czech and the hero Jiráček, won in Montenegro happily 1: 0 and celebrates the advancement to the European Championship.
Montenegrins due to the precise defense of the Czech team got into pressure only in the second half.
The losers of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of about 200 million crowns will come to the domestic football coffers.
From the opening minutes, a lot of combative football was played.
Both teams had a hard time getting involved in the combination and the game was mostly around the halfway line.
Therefore, the pressure of the home footballers did not come in the first half, long kicks for the defense were precisely averted by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students formed a human shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program against a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed outside the building at noon on Tuesday and then chanted death to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, formed a human shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, which processes uranium, on Tuesday.
They are showing that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in a recent report that Iran does not appear to have stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then shouted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be targeted, according to the Israeli press, in addition to the Isfahan center.
Diet of an obese child: no breakfast and cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent being obese.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it shows how important the environment in which a person grows up and the role models around him are for healthy human development.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of obese children up to half as often as in families of children of normal weight.
More than 19 percent of obese people had French fries for dinner the day before a survey linked to an educational event called Obesity is no coincidence.
It is also not customary in fat families to play sports, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 children from elementary schools from all over the Czech Republic took part in it.
It was the second year of the Obesity is no Coincidence event, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have joined the project.
Proper eating and sufficient exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five times a day in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," reads one of the survey results.
Without breakfast and sausage in the evening
Experts point out that relative details, such as regular family breakfast time, are also essential for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of families of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was finding out that in a tenth of households there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families of obese children are much more likely to consume unhealthy French fries.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sugary sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly do sports, the result for their parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Build your own diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own menu according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes there are a lot of floury, meat and sweet dishes.
"The great popularity of sweet sodas is particularly alarming," the survey final report states.
For lunch, pasta won over poultry as the main dish.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes is also low.
Inclination to health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who filled in the questionnaire after the educational lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project results state.
This was noticeable, for example, in the case of sugary sodas, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children were also much more likely to tick poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire and would cut down on sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the pros
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained a bit that there was already a lot in the introductory lessons.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it works on set.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "packed".
This time, the headmistress Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And the vast majority of them are.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually soften broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips on how to emphasize the figure of a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, and at the same time not to dress a woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not really fit, then it pays to have at least one such piece tailored.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that constantly shifts, rolls up, stands at the waist and so on.
A boyish figure, on the other hand, can afford to wear clothes with lashes, appliqués, embroidery or scoops.
Of course, there is a lot of such information and types of characters, so I'm glad I have a whole week to organize all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that given the homework assigned, it's too much.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and body type.
I will "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In my mind, I rejoice, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
Clothes have to be cut from magazines or searched on the Internet and printed and then graphically processed.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to the graphic design.
Thinking about the graphic side of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about it.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture full of information about the types of characters was enriched by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want originally a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on your bare body, put on pumps and take pictures as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But what I appreciated the most was the following advice: "To work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaking them," James said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we crush all the precepts, what to combine with, for what, why, when even in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have many more variations of clothes ready than they can photograph.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (ten outfits), I have to be ready to "natajlovat" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo clothes look and work in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
So we have to count on this when creating an outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up to half of the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a prodigy, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it unnecessary (it's enough that I know something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone lets us create styling, then we should count on the fact that they will most likely dictate a completely different (smaller) size than it really has.
Then all we have to do is google and find out if the tabloids wrote about the fact that the celebrity had lost weight and so on.
Honza and Mario on Sunday told us that it is not enough for a stylist to orientate himself in fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In her work, she primarily communicates with the people she dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to pander to yourself, to stand by your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort through her wardrobe and add nice pieces, you can't throw out her whole wardrobe and say, oh my God, that's horrible."
"Find at least a few things to praise and recommend what they can be worn with," says Mario.
He also showed us specifically what the so-called "flat" or set bag must contain.
It's the one you fasten around your waist and have all the necessary props with you.
In addition to obvious things such as scissors, a hair roller or safety pins, there are also a silon thread (with which the stylist helps himself when photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips that we use to fasten the back of the clothing if it is larger (a pin or other clamp is not allowed, it would damage the clothing), or a sewing.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to properly tape shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We must not even touch the shoes with scissors, so that they do not accidentally get damaged.
So you really need skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
This skill is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend continuation of the course.
It is becoming more and more clear to me that styling on a professional level is really not a walk in the park, no matter who says what they want.
Need for Speed: The Run takes place across America.
Recension
The originally carefree ride turns into a routine morning shift due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
Ambitions have largely been fulfilled, but it is of no use when no one seemed to want to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, raised high expectations before its release.
He promised to move the age-old racing series Need for Speed in a new direction and from the playable demos it seemed like a game that would not have to be in the genre of action racing only in numbers.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages would turn out, in which the main character gets out of the car and runs on his own.
However, as usual with the NFS series, many things are a bit different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole is dragged down by a few unnecessary bugs that have appeared in the series more or less for several years.
So these are actually not even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main hero Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution offers participation in an illegal race across America.
You will get behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea carries with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One does not have the feeling for a moment that the game would offer the same thing all the time.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing worldly.
But driving across deserts, autumn landscapes or high in snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are from time to time diversified by some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well planted in succession.
There are only a few types, but it is enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up with time (a classic duel with a stopwatch) and then a duel with a single opponent awaits you.
From time to time, the police get involved in this, making your whole effort even more unpleasant.
A novelty is the passages outside the car.
It's more about interactive animations, where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (specifically, perhaps even only three).
In the end, however, it is a good thing, because this element has no chance to become annoying and in the context of the above is one of the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that nowadays it is definitely not who knows, but it can not be said that it would be a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing still suits the local driving model quite well, even though we could find a better one from the competition.
So far, so everything is in perfect order.
But problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not very good.
We do not expect a game of this type to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before hitting any object, then probably not everything is quite right.
Typically, when tightly overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, you sometimes only lightly lick each other, but other times, in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't really matter, but it will reliably tune you.
Restarts are handled in such a way that if you smash or go far off the track, the game throws you back to the last clue on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race all over again.
It is therefore more of a tool in case something goes wrong than that you can explicitly rely on them.
Sometimes, however, even restarts do not help, they are solved only by the need to learn the part of the race by heart.
The big malady of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply will not fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civilian" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It sucks especially in situations where you see how between two oncoming cars the opponent in front of you easily passes, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "calculated" so that the situation always occurs right under your nose.
Opponents have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will come across several places where, again regardless of time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
Most of all it hits at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there in front of you, obviously, at any cost.
When it is driving in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the oncoming cars, so you will probably get a few times at first.
One can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fueled, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgust you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the gameplay is fun and sometimes so action-packed that sometimes you literally can't keep track of where everything is flying.
And it basically does not matter whether it is due to the concept of fifty unique tracks, the ordering of races so that boredom has no chance, or anything else.
An unconventional idea is to exchange cars during races.
You have to watch out for gas stations by the roads, because that's where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you can make do with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, powerful American crashes for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical riding, such as on winding mountain roads.
The main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which is a race in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you earn not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is common to both challenges and story.
To get a higher driver level, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds.
It is also again connected to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the metro tunnel (so be it), where you drive in the dark on the rails (so be it).
Numbers between 150 and 200 km/h are flashing on the speedometer (so be it) and a metro train rushes in from behind and uncompromisingly scraps you.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought a little when creating the game, or whether the authors really consider us such big idiots.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It is annoying that in some of the more tense moments, the frame rate decreases, in some cases quite tragically.
However, this applies mainly to crashes with a larger number of participants, where smooth imaging would not be of any use to you anyway.
The sound is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category of "every dog a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, the game will probably not be bought by anyone.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is thus quite embarrassing.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS game in the last few years.
But this is how the game feels unfinished.
It's certainly fun, but be prepared for the mistakes to smash you in the eye with the power of airport headlights.
Charles University choirs will be heard at the concert Students of Velvet

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation as negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has quite significantly upset the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to stabilize a bit, calm down and for all the players to get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how seriously she takes her motto "Comprehensibly and openly about Europe" already in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envy her.
Vicenova also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was bland, that he was a grey official, that he could not fulfil any role, and I have to say that everyone was taken aback that he played the role excellently."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to twenty-seven member states, who communicates well with them and who has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unifying and making EU policy vis-à-vis countries such as China or India more readable.
Nobody wants to ban us from cheese
Vicenová also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, is living and will live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government at that time as a major negative that damaged the Czech Republic very strongly.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only the Presidency that was "really busy", but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being dealt with today.
In addition, the Union's new seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which is becoming considerably more complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and austere, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda of future negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, which she came to Brussels with: "About Europe clearly".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
How is a citizen supposed to understand that in Brussels they really do not invent curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone really has to ban us cheese?"
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive side of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me says: 'Hey, what are you meeting there, what about your Visegrad Four?'
In the future, according to Vicen, the EU will mainly face new tough rules for the budgetary policies of member states.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe, rather than a new "European federation" as very real.
"We have eurozone countries and non-eurozone countries."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that do not want to should stand by."
"There will be more institutes and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be discussed among all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM begins its second century of existence
If one were to search for a word that would most accurately describe IBM's strategy, the closest thing to it would probably be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by the company's first CEO, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" thus became the imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a century by staying true to its core values while not being afraid to change everything else.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO, on the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
In the thirties, Watson approached the care of his employees similarly to the entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IBM were among the first American employees to have paid vacation, insurance from their employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM's relationship with the customer has been equally sophisticated over the long term.
From the beginning, the company was a genius at exploiting talent - it was one of the first companies in the world to abolish any discrimination so that it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, Palmisana is currently planned to be replaced by a woman, Virginia Rometty, next year.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, still holding the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called jams, online brainstorming sessions that give rise to many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good reputation
A strong position in the business is ensured by the company's strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, told the Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and thus creating the market.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it is familiarly known in the United States because of its logo - has grown over a century into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. tech company, and five of its employees have won Nobel Prizes.
Her inventions include an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a barcode and a floppy disk.
IBM, at about $220 billion, became the second-largest tech company by market capitalization this year (first being Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations hit the tastes of customers and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you can't emotionally attach yourself to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundation on many platforms — and abandoning them when they don't work.
Unlike, for example, the competing Microsoft, which basically stands or falls on the Windows operating system.
Future-proof technology
Services account for the largest share of IBM's revenues, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
In 1990, it was still the strongest representative of hardware with more than half of its share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, during which time it has invested $58 billion in promising technology purchases.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is following the legacy of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis untouched.
IBM's share price has skyrocketed by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company's net profit has been growing continuously.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but your values.
It can therefore be expected that even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally having the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for the company's subsidiaries in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM gave the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technology such as the famous "attendance clocks," a clock that records an employee's arrival and going.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the firm's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed IBM's founders - Watson's ideas are still built on an unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began by manufacturing and selling all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson was in charge, sales doubled to nine million dollars and began a large-scale expansion to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after nearly forty years in the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the sixties, people and computers from IBM helped NASA control flights into space - to Mercury, Saturn and, in 1969, the famous flight of man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "PC" that set the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully devote itself to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has paid off for IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is the smart use of technology in previously unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city administration.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help retailers manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong domestic history.
It established its branch in the former Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM Czech Republic, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters is based in Prague and there is also a world-class voice research team.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from his rosy dream and return home.
But now she does not want to wait and has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted Bartošová asylum in her home in the summer, she apparently did not even dream how her marriage would end in the end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, ostensibly reconciled with her husband's relationship, and now she even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář and Bartošová broke up once, the open arms of his wife would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live out his life in our shared home, no one will expel him."
"However, she will live to see it not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová revealed, adding that she has already detached herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Josef doesn't mind that Darina closed his back door so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and I am not going to change it."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, property, shopping."
"Darina and I talk quite normally, except that we don't share a bed," Rychtář told Blesk.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, she would not prevent it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he's going, who he's going with, or if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
Women's Worst Habits: Do They Affect You?
If you ask men if they could name any typical female bad habits, they are usually quick to throw them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female vices that can perfectly pump blood in men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth per week?
Do you like shopping in bulk at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should curb their passion for shopping at least a little.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around clothing stores, looking for well-fitting uppers and then trying them all (ideally in different colors) in the cubicle?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't these sentences remind you of something?
Right?
Then you are one of those women who are obsessed with the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to their partners constantly complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the frequency of these complaints increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping tiles, dusting, scrubbing baths - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on clean tiles with a dirty foot, for soiling the scrubbed sink and patting the glass living room wall you took so much trouble to polish?
If you suffer from this "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand in the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can jeopardize your relationships and family well-being.
Cavil
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow too?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you poke your partner several times a day, know that you can reliably dial him.
Of course, you don't mean it in any bad way, you want to make sure everything is fine.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to poke them so much...
Gossip, gossip
For some women, gossip, gossip, but also insults and conspiracy against someone are also characteristic.
Women are relationship-oriented, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Perhaps each of us releases some small harmless gossip or gossip here and there.
Hand on heart, it is inherent in almost all women.
On the contrary, however, gossip of the coarsest grain, which likes and often gossip, perhaps everyone despises and is especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's work collective.
Jagr and Voracek provided assists in Philadelphia's win
Hockey forward Jaromir Jagr contributed two assists in Philadelphia's 5-3 win at Carolina on Monday and is once again at the forefront of Czech player productivity in the competition.
Claude Giroux benefited from the thirty-nine-year-old star's record on both occasions, adding one more pass and being named the best player of the match.
Jagr's teammate Jakub Voracek also recorded two assists in the game.
Jagr told reporters after the game that he had predicted a big night for Giroux.
"I told him before the game that he would score a hat-trick.
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," Jagr explained, after whose action Giroux scored on the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later, the team's second hit had a Czech footprint.
Voracek won the puck behind the Hurricanes net and passed it between the circles to scoring Maxim Talbot.
Seconds before the first intermission, home player Patrick Dwyer reduced the deficit, but the start of the second period again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored the third goal, then his shot was converted into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said.
"I never thought I'd be playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's reversing," Jagr added.
Carolina made the game even more drama, with a goal by Tuomo Ruutu and again Dwyer, who scored from a penalty shot, to get within one goal.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, finishing up outnumbered two to one.
"He hit the Pronger well in our zone."
"He poked the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) drove to the far pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked," Voracek described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia moved to the top of the Eastern Conference with the victory.
Czech Montreal defenseman Jaroslav Spacek missed the game against Buffalo, retiring in the second period due to an upper-body injury.
The Candiens, in addition to the experienced bek, also lost a two-goal lead and lost after a penalty shootout 2: 3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomas Plekanec.
Rather than losing points, the home coach was annoyed by the extensive backrow sickness, with only five defenders finishing the match.
"It's bad."
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"Substitution after substitution it was coming at us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moved the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," defenseman P.K. Subban said.
Czech goalie Ondrej Pavelec contributed thirty saves to Winnipeg's 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
Five different scorers shared the goals for the Jets, who broke a five-game losing streak.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies overwhelmingly sold only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled on holiday to the sea in the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Lake Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime inclined to the West and the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia was subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the journey to the West.
By far, however, Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic by far, which resulted in a large number of chalets and cottages that Czechs bought and this custom survives to this day.
Since 1989, travelling by Czechs has experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which we no longer realize today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to Croatia, which is currently the most popular for us, until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right at the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the visa requirement to neighboring Western European countries was abolished, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austrian Vienna or Germany.
For a long time, Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone wanted to go there at least for a while.
For example, in Paris, tours of Czechs slept in parks in tents, because our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of travelling Czechs at that time was to bring their own food, canned food, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists to freely buy Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living, and with it our average wages, were rising, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare charter air tours from 1997, which made air tours incredibly cheaper compared to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution travel occurred in 2000, when the historically first direct charter flight to exotics was dispatched from the Czech Republic to Thailand due to considerable demand.
Since this year, direct charters have been flying with Czech tourists to warm distant countries every year, this winter there will be flights directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the USA cancelled visas for Czech tourists and thus our country definitively ranked among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history they spent more than 15 thousand on one foreign holiday, including the cost of the place of stay. CZK per person.
General meeting to find chairman, but stalemate threatens again
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months and there is a risk that Ivan Hašek's successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which electoral rules will be followed.
Without it, there will be no voting on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and when he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hašek era, football slipped back into skirmishes between the two union chambers, which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was on full display on 16 September, when a new president was to be chosen.
Delegates of the General Meeting gathered at the National House in Prague's Smíchov district unnecessarily, as the meeting remained blocked and it was not just a way of election.
There was no consensus on who actually has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only statutory representatives or also officials authorized by power of attorney.
On this one point, there has since been a partial agreement, helped by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there is still controversy over the electoral code.
The Executive Committee has not brought much clarity to the situation either, as it does not deal with anything else in its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
The view of the option of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in Round 3 to eliminate the possibility of a stalemate?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FACR, who represents professional football in the association's management.
According to the bylaws proposed model, in the third round the winner will be the candidate who will have the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to make concessions so that the candidate who gets the higher sum of the percentages of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must obtain at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage count.
"But then the two previous rounds would lose their meaning, that would completely negate the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Svoboda party, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the valid statutes.
Somewhat surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, although it is estimated that the election rules set out in the statutes suit Pelt the most of all the candidates.
"I want the election to be done according to the statutes at most."
"So that they don't invent some proxy nonsense like at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All passions will be calmed by the national team's possible progress to the European Championship today."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience in managing football at both the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposefully adapt the regulations."
"This may cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"But I hope that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for agreement between all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete before the match.
The air special, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were supposed to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and an alternative option was being sought to transport part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the barrage rematch.
In the end, a ministerial meeting may be decisive, which could reportedly take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to force the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík goes into the fight for the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If the head of Pilsen footballers, Tomáš Paclík, had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even have applied for the top position.
"If there is a good candidate, I fight for him and I will not vote."
"But in the current situation, we have not been able to find anyone like that," Paclík told the Czech News Agency.
Paclík is motivated to fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, from getting to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also emphasizes that if he wins, he would only last in the role of chairman until 2013, when the regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected with football events.
"I've talked to some of the people who might be considered."
"For me it was crazy when some people said that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football.
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most bothered by Pelt's connection with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates' votes at the general meeting.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable for Pelta to stand in the chairmanship.
"If he had won, the status quo would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name was mentioned in wiretaps years ago during the investigation of a corruption affair, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who also takes with grace his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman".
If Paclík triumphs in Thursday's election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, thinks the same way.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But he wouldn't be able to manage the association from a managerial point of view."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't do it," said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by standing behind the dismissal of the referee committee headed by Luděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims that he would dare to lead the association.
He refers to his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which celebrated its premiere league triumph in May with his support.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment, to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which goes to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy to, for example, the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider one of the priorities to strengthen the FACR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should address."
"If gambling is taxed, as declared by political parties, I understand their argument, but frankly they have to say where the money will go," he said.
Paclík does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club as a burden, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FACR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares in a Pilsen club to someone and returning there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FACR statutes that would eliminate electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would push for the FACR to have new statutes that would definitively eliminate disputes over the election rules in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the eventual success of the football team today.
Pelta promised before the failed election in September that he intends to focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go into the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so the two-month postponement could have been useful for him to defend his ideas about football management and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday.
"He feels that it is high time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
That is why he believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with voting are due to the euphoria that prevailed during the government of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Meeting, the Articles of Association were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they didn't allow for different interpretations, we've had a chairman since September," Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he conceived as a decoy for the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a matter of principle that we can't live without," Pelta said.
He continues to try not to define himself against his opponents.
He has already announced that he can imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he respects because of his legal education, and he knows very well that his opponent would be its first vice-chairman.
For a long time he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's already had some success.
"But his attacks were undignified and he caught a lot of people off guard by the way he campaigned."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," said Pelta, who said he remained faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest leagues to the national team.
It should be a showcase for football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately after that, I would plunge into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure enough money for the whole of football," the forty-six-year-old candidate told the Czech News Agency two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the content of individual employees," he said of Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness about the long interregnum.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Meeting, he believes that on Thursday the delegates will not go to Nymburk in vain.
"If the only point of contention is how the third round of voting is going to happen, then we can get over that."
"Football needs credibility, and it will only gain credibility by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before what may be the decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that under him the FACR would start working hard
If the current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl was elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he will start working hard.
He wants to push through systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole.
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national team, professional football, performance football and youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview for the Czech News Agency.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute competencies in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
"And I'm going to give work hard to keep football moving forward by leaps and bounds in each of these segments."
"A lot of people probably wouldn't be happy about that because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw obstacles in my way and question my every move," he explained why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hašek.
"A lot of work has been done in these two years and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will have reverberations in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation at the union could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for siding with anyone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be well, not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he was only the Czech chairman.
"Even though some people try to claim the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be the current situation when there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, joined the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his successes to be saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the contrary, he blames himself for the fact that the union does not pull together.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", he considers the second of his opponents Paclík to be a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job in Pilsen during that year."
"If elected, he would hopefully continue with the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump into blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from a Ufon point of view, a sumptuous pool in Budapest: Anyone travelling through Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after exploring the cities or travelling, let your tired legs rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where wellness by the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on voyages of discovery over the past year and a half, it was not missing from her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the artistically sculpted domes, swam opposite the marble putti (figures of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) that awaited her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she immediately entered it in her notebook - with remarkable details about the construction method and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and are now presented in her just-published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing): People's Swimming Pools in Munich, Historic Swimming Pool Palaces in the Black Forest, "Hard Core Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
Her "Journey to the Most Extraordinary Spas in Central Europe" led her through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia each.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sports, it is not too much, says Meder - only in the water it is something different.
It's infuriating that swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says Meder, a Vienna-based woman.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much for Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, one has a water surface in a spa."
"It's transparent, but it's also a reflection of the beauty of the building."
Everything is optically doubled: high vaults, colorful tiles, diving boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Badeuden) (Bathing Pleasures) " provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historic oases of wellness on 190 pages - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the collector of swimming pools Mrs. Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (Miskolc-Tapolca Cave Baths) and thermal baths whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful spectacle. While you can see the whole city from Zurich's rooftop swimming pool, you can gaze at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of the spa in St. Anton – and: In the steam baths there is a window from which you can watch the hustle and bustle of the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most striking pool design awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: the Ötztal waterpark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
Steam rises from three upwardly open basins in winter, while in the background of the Ötztal mountains it rises to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Mrs. Meder have the smell of chlorine rising to her nostrils.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, and the Árpád spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells of fuel oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that one has reached the healing baths.
The smell comes from the alkaline bicarbonate healing water, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather strange wellness experience.
However, there was also one place that Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the spa designed by architect Dušan Jurkovič was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing massively between the tiles.
On the other hand, they stood up to extinction in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This spa has already completed three phases of construction; One can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that date back to its creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favourite spa spot for pool connoisseur Iris Meder, and not just because she comes from the Black Forest.
"It is already a feat to combine such diverse architectural styles into such a beautiful complex," says Meder.
For such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank examines commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank abandoning its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the concern wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg-
For federal citizens, the point is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of those surveyed even want Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to withdraw from the deal because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest people.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks are therefore complicit in the world's hunger problem.
The consumer campaign, which is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that capital-market participants interested in high-risk trades have become decoupled from supply and demand - and have made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Different from competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to investigate the criticisms and said that no deal "is worth putting Deutsche Bank's reputation at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the complaints from the Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be concluded, after which the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board of directors - along with recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, bank officials want to say what consequences they will draw.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works on his image by himself.
Thilo Bode, head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report, but also stepped up his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are now harming the common good."
Let Ackermann, as the bank's top lobbyist, live up to his duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items for which money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann cares about starving people or about Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann's insight seems surprising at first glance, but what is clear is that the Group boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors, other than planned, would not move to the supervisory board.
By turning away from questionable agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about possible losses - his successor should deal with it in the end.
One in two would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch tries to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that involve bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: As a result of the survey, one in two would terminate all investments where money flows into speculation on raw materials.
43 percent would warn acquaintances about such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about terminating their account and moving to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with highs, lows and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and desolate.
Now it is reopened as a showhouse.
When one is passionate about modern post-war architecture, bright forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer is an apt and famous example for the Brussels World's Fair of 1958.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and lofty steel and glass structure.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built a pavilion in Austria for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW Palace plus the key construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was placed in the Schweizer Garten near Vienna's Südbahnhof (South Railway Station) after the World's Fair, reconstructed and opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
However, the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art had a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and fell into disrepair more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, it is now called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition there - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, made a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, including figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modernism, pushed through vigorous reconstruction among politicians and conservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship money, and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be built, and an office building would have to be built.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him, where he viewed exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and reused.
There were much bigger problems with the current renovation: The building was a "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, fiberglass reinforced insulating glass was used, and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings rehabilitated.
Two underground floors provided space for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, and a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still lofty Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the heritage office and a low budget.
"Often a material had to be found that was good and cheap, and the heritage office also liked it," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels," Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history," said recently.
Such architecture, he said, is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "inspire proper self-confidence."
In this case, however, the 21st Century House is not in an inappropriate place, as an urban happy coincidence has happened: A completely redesigned "City Quarter near the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is being built around the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another lucky coincidence will happen: the 21st Century House could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as can be heard, is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood at the Schweizer Garten site.
Railway plans package for winter crisis in the amount of millions
The railway has drawn up a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
This will cost millions.
To combat winter-induced train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" carried a preliminary report, citing an internal group plan, that a total of around 300 million euros is expected to be invested by 2015.
It is said to make better use of trains and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to snow removal on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to rid the platforms of snow and ice within four to five hours of the platforms needed to operate and 90 percent of the switches needed to operate.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube, after a summit meeting with government and industry officials, warned of train outages and delays this winter.
In the last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger transport because, among other things, under difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
Added to this are delays in dispatching ICE trains
The railway has also been unable to cope for years that it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked more often in the workshop when one ICE train at the central station of Köln had its axle destroyed.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fine in the U.S.
After the uproar surrounding CEO Josef Ackermann, there are new troubles in the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in damages.
As if Deutsche Bank didn't have enough problems at home, the industry giant's past in the US has caught up: the Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million (€106 million) in one settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage certificates.
The NCUA, the financial-market regulator, accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks into buying financial products with false promises; that the risks may have decreased.
Such securities lost considerable value during the crisis, dragging banks with them into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt in the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the helpfulness of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billions in damages.
The settlements now completed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped down on other big banks, suing JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Dubious mortgage certificates are called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When America's housing bubble burst in 2007, it was fatal for many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Although the events happened a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing to meet the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to obtain redress or sanction misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 international big banks of putting two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a disadvantage in their roughly $200 billion mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank also faces a lawsuit from FHFA, involving multiple deals totaling about $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurt institute be held liable for "substantial losses", without, however, specifying a precise amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT business.
Since March, it has bought more than ten billion dollars worth of shares.
Warren Buffett, a prominent American investor so far, has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
But now he has read IBM's business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is seen as knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, it may be called IBM's IT mother rock, now "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed on the American economic radio station CNBC that he has bought $ 10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway Investment Holding thus became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement.
He praised management, which even tried to achieve proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services, such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
To date, Buffett has tended to avoid technology companies.
He claims that he invests only in undertakings whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett turned to freight rail, lubricant manufacturers, and machine manufacturers.
In addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, his Berkshire Hathaway holding also owns shares in a number of large concerns such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old man took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s of the last century and built it into one of the most valuable businesses in the world through wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unerring sense of making money earned him the nickname "The Orakel of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock rose by one percent before the stock market began.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total value of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is considered along with Apple and Microsoft to be the world's most valuable technology enterprises.
But Buffett wouldn't want to work at Microsoft.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be an intimate friend of his.
The threat is palpable
After the revelations of the "Cell in Zwickau", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspapers even speak of a "bloody ideology" that is now being revived.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news was reacted to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this brings back a specter that has long been presumed dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to that of right-wing extremists.
That xenophobia existed in Germany was never in doubt.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a scale whose dimensions can no longer be seen.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" was the headline of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be an undercover police agent of the Constitution Protection Unit, and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted prudently: it remembered the weekend demonstrations with silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish Community of Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, life together was staged - as a history of success.
A slap in the face is the coverage of several Turkish media: "A gift from Germany for its fiftieth birthday" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
The publication of the "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken away from making this connection of thought.
"It's starting to smell," reads the headline of a column by Ahmet Külahci.
In it, he emphasizes that people who paid taxes and contributed to the reconstruction of Germany through their work were murdered.
The most critical discussion in German-Turkish Internet forums is the approach of the police and their late success in the investigation.
Why didn't German authorities think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many show themselves at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity here continues so superficially, immigrants will have nothing left but to defend and arm themselves."
"That will be perhaps the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends very strongly on the quality of clarification and the proportionality of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What it means if internal peace in Germany is threatened is explained by the Mölln and Solingen assassinations in the nineties.
The photograph of the burned Solingen site is deeply etched in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
But the assassinations made a more palpable sense of reciprocity on the part of the Turks.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time mainly criticized the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish state president, but allowed himself to be represented at the funeral ceremony in Köln by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the Turks there paid.
Quite as if a man's worth were measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks is in the local state arrangement.
In addition to efforts to extensively clarify and reassess right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
The scandalous bank on Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is based in Switzerland, not Italy or France.
UBS suffered near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now some German has to straighten it out.
That is certainly not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure as head of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: president of the board of the Swiss big bank UBS – an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber enjoyed himself publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it was clear that everything would turn out completely differently.
A dealer from UBS in London bypassed all of the bank's security systems and wasted around €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of UBS, Oswald Grübel, a respected banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board has also been scalded ever since – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over as early as May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and an emissions banker, and he would certainly need time to train.
Suddenly, he will take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title of "Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe"
For UBS is both huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared for the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a taciturn and solid, but also cunning asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a difference in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed more wealthy clients' money than any other bank in the world, with $1.6 trillion.
On the other hand, it has advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world's largest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time professor of banking in Zurich, recounts: "I always used UBS as a model for a good bank to my students."
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the chairman of the board, who until now had been considered a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, it was known why he had left.
The bank's investment division squandered Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To withstand this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But it did find investors, but investors it would have recently turned up its nose: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was only the first impact.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to admit new billions in losses, the president of the board Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second highest paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
Disaster followed in October 2008: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its mistaken investments during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The Nationalbank bought tens of billions of troubled securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to convertible bonds for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it was for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the output of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"We couldn't save UBS one more time," says Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe is followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and showed its willingness to release the data of wealthy customers who evaded taxes with the help of banks if possible.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of unjustified profits from these deals, including a penalty surcharge.
In doing so, UBS admitted more or less openly that it had facilitated tax evasion.
At the same time, it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it had been before.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management to help evade tax.
And just as things calmed down a bit, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business anabasis: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: risk management in investment banking still doesn't seem to be working out.
"The Adoboli case seems to have shown that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and Finanz professor of finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not manage risk control."
Yet this was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers set out long ago to become the guardians of the great fortunes of the world: no too great a risk, but security for the sake of money - it was also from this side that the world collapsed again for the Alpine Republic.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli have become for particularly high-quality chocolate.
UBS's headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery stores like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Sprüngli pastry shops.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from the Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them stand massive leather armchairs, next to the bank's logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.
But the Swiss bank's idea, UBS and Credit Suisse, has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank discovers.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, and in the end, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS may have grown too bigger, he finds, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have spread.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say.
"And if they did, they had long since adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, causing it first high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the governing coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save a standing big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into a massive concern.
A bank was created, which at the merger was already too big for a small Switzerland - and continued to grow.
It helped that UBS's two different banking predecessors were complementary: one rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management, and poorer but more internationally involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came profitably to a lot of money with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach-driven man who has worked his way up from banking science."
But Ospel is said to have relied on Wuffli towards the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He probably thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The plain is: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which Group CEO Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: Knock Goldman Sachs down.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It listed "League Tables," a waiting list that documented the success of banks at the time.
In it, UBS tried to place at the very top.
She has already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the corporate consultants in charge highlight one weakness: In international interest trading, in bankers' "Fixed Income" language, there may be a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS may have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and the risk-hedging fund it set up invested in Subprime's US investments.
It developed into a massive machine that repackaged securities into US mortgage loans and passed them on - while also retaining the risks themselves.
Also when other banks were looking for a way out for a long time.
"Back in the summer of 2007, when the housing market was in flames, UBS was still buying there," says Geiger, a banking expert.
How great is the euphoria, so deep the fall.
Manager after manager had to leave when attempts to clean up became more difficult than thought.
The positions at UBS became the ejection seat and are still swinging today.
Whoever runs a big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They need to find a strategy for the bank, where all close business models have disappeared.
Geiger, a banking expert, already has an idea: End investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is about to decline significantly, that much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the bank's new boss, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor, Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has asserted himself: He is to run UBS business for a long time, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its mid-nineties.
3500 posts will be deleted.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking.
Publicly, however, he says only that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs heavily on the US stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has discouraged American investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended striking effect.
Subdued industrial production on the Continent nipped hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
General facilitation by a change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail
The euro fell against the dollar.
Italian and Greek glass last week was considered half full, not half empty — but now problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial values stood on the tickets of sale.
The Dow-Jones Standard Values Index recorded a decline of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the close of trading.
During trading, the market barometer oscillated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500-Index finished at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and exited trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a drop of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and prepared to end the boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
This has made investors in the US skeptical. "We are not an island, we are addicts," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe is unlikely to recover as quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investing legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC interview that it will probably not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boosted the traditional group's share price and had it listed almost one percent higher against the trend during trading.
The paper ended up almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett reportedly paid an average of $170 apiece and now holds 5.5 percent.
His investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's shares fell at 2.6 percent significantly stronger than the market.
The house monetizes almost the rest of its shares in China Construction Bank, receiving $6.6 billion in return.
The institute wants to use the net profit from the trade to fill its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
Planemaker Boeing rose slightly, reducing losses in the Dow.
The shares gained 1.5 percent as the group collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates Airlines ordered 50 long-haul 777s on Sunday, putting the order at $18 billion.
Including the right of first refusal for another 20 machines, the volume is as high as $ 26 billion.
With the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values rose slightly, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
With sales of $1.38 billion, the Nasdaq ended with 630 shares rising, 1913 declining and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, ravens are considered "problem birds": But these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the city's image for centuries, yet in some villages complaints about dirt and noise caused by animals accumulate.
At the same time, there is no remedy in sight against the "problem birds".
Ravens can no longer be expelled from cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East Frissia.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists also derived the city's problems from the exodus of specially protected ravens: The use of chemicals in agriculture is likely to be increasingly destroying traditional areas for living.
Persecution, growing development and felling of typical nesting trees make life difficult for birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are in Soest in Westphalia, in the northwest, including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, a 2005 controversial project to mass-kill crows in a rural district sparked negative headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of animals in bird traps and beating them with sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, scaring, brings nothing", as the urban planner and landscape painter Werner Klöver from Leer discovered.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies split and divide into other places."
Scaring is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them out."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive residential areas and enticing them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws," on the other hand, psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens promoted because of the completely different treatment of animals: "One bump in the face is ultimately the best way to endure self-confidence."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Crow Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where information boards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent raven.
In the meantime, the project is said to have already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Every volume of communication is at stake here, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Ravens don't just use tools to get a treat, they even make their tool as an aid.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four ravens to see how far the birds' intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to bring stones to the collapse of a structure to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape a stone had to be to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a tiny container with a moth larva.
With their beaks, birds could not reach their prey.
But the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From these, all four animals shaped a hook, with the help of which they fished the container from the pipe by the handle.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to get stuck.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not come to fruition.
Favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland received their last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in Play-off matches.
Led by double-time successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) to make their fifth consecutive appearance at the European Championship perfect after a 0-0 result in the first leg.
The Czechs were enough in the Play-off rematch with outsider Montenegro result 1: 0 (0: 0), when the first match was a clear thing.
Croatia did not score a goal with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland reached a 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored further goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional of the Bundesliga Zvjezdan Misimovic converted a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia disappointed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a good start.
Ronaldo took an early lead by hanging a free-kick from about 30 yards into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long-range shooting and hit from 25 meters to make it 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not play in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Džek.
The former Wolfsbury player from the English club Manchester City at the top of the table settled the ball on the bottom edge of the crossbar with a header, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood in the center.
After a tackle on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark took a questionable penalty kick after a Fabio Coentrao action that Misimovic confidently converted.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up clarified everything with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
With that, the 1976 European Champion leaves for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilko with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented a possible own goal of Tomas Sivok (9th) from being possible at the last moment.
Montenegro had their greatest opportunities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the edge of the penalty area just past Cech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down goalkeeper of the Czechs world class, again reduced by the striker FC Seoul (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle in Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink will almost certainly vacate his place on the bench for third at the 2002 World Cup, the Croats can rejoice in their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir's stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the bar with a long-range shot in the seventh minute, striker Kazim also could not hang the bounced ball in the goal.
After that terrible second, Croatia increasingly took control.
Also, after the break, the Croats did not get a goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, there were also Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward gave coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team into the lead in the 32nd minute with a 4-0 win in the first leg.
Konstantin Vassiliev (57th) equalized for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane had his first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian defence prevented a possible leading goal.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was quite far away.
After a failed defence by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to make it 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
Europe's largest software maker SAP is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around $2 billion (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow in, Dax said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and employ relevant staff," acting chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is now to increase from the current 2500 employees to 4500.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP's more than 176,000 customers worldwide are booming in the country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers earned approximately 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the business of the software maker, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is going well as never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is, supported by extensive exploration, to promote sustained growth in China."
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with such a long list of characters that it makes your head spin.
One piece of advice on what to do at that point: Carefully tear out this page and bookmark it.
You will become very familiar with all the people in Mr. Englund's novel narration, and this list will serve as a navigation - a kind of beacon - when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are discussing here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as an "anti-historical work".
It contains several well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, while it is almost devoid of ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as "a book about what it was like." It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker, like candle flames lit in a church, new ones added to the tangle of fates, while others fade away.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It modifies the idea that World War I was all about horrific trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
In this book, the soldiers deal with problems with bee nests falling on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids, or struggling with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it is a very moving read.
War will consume people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina reeking of gunpowder.
When cannon fire starts in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with her children, do you run away or stay?
Who is actually coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," Mr. Englund observed, "has been filled with conjecture, conjecture, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and engaging, but the inclusion of small moments and details makes them completely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with hardship and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Substitutes, substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions 'meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheep fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), dried root tobacco and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles'.
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in sausage production and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American finds within himself an inner impulse for savagery and brutality, and then says of war: "Eventually, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and whiskey, or an evening newspaper or a good book and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hidden behind the stiff self inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When one finally reconciles oneself to sacrifice, one would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like "a convict who is secretly hanged."
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
"The conflict became more and more economic competition and competition," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a new breed of beast of the coming century: an articulate and ideologically sworn mass murderer in tailored clothes who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trafficking of gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones rubbed it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not flashy, which fits his human subject perfectly.
In dozens of small excertions, he captures the way in which war "unleashed absolutely intractable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly worked with hints rather than complex narratives, such as Paul Fussell's "World War I and Modern Memories" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Quiet on the Western Front."
Mr Englund prefers an unconventional approach.
His book has the most devastating ending unparalleled in non-fiction.
However, I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, snatched the page from the list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this time a precisely planned raid for the minute
Hundreds of police officers took part, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the operation except a few high-ranking officers. Others were first told that it was an exercise.
The action was led by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted the problems the police department faced during the operation.
Cases in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against demonstrators, were not allowed to be repeated, which violated the rules of separation and, moreover, the wave of public sympathy spilled over to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation, which aimed to clear Zuccotti Park of demonstrators, was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
Leaders were inspired by operations in other cities.
A massive crisis behaviour exercise took place in Randalls Island in preparation for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot control training — counterterrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers — with a focus on the Lower Manhattan borough.
The final part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute," said someone to whom the event was initially explained only as an "exercise."
"I know a couple of police officers who were also called to this operation, and they certainly weren't told they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew that he was going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, city officials planned to clear the park, but then abandoned the plan because as soon as demonstrators heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of officers who are routinely used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher crime levels.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come and go to the park during the day, so one hour a night was the perfect time to kick off the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the troops set off, emergency unit trucks lined up with arc lamps and loudspeakers on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the recorded message blaring from the loudspeakers frightened many demonstrators.
When riot police entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say they did not touch a tent until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were spotted gathering at the edge of the park to enter it if any arrests were needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief spokesman for the police department, Paul J. Browne, said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and in addition, some officers treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street along the park's western boundary could film without any problems.
Police advanced westwards, weaving through a thick tangle of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. Behind them came teams from the sanitary department, who immediately raked everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting images appeared on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The most die-hard group of demonstrators took refuge near the kitchen of their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up roadblocks and the police began methodical arrests of them.
About ten people in the center of the camp were attached to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "organizing riots and resisting arrests," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief detective, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr Kelly was present but "was not involved in directing the operation," Mr Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to be called.
Roadblocks were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these locations, police then deployed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were spotted pushing people further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o'clock in the morning, a protester south of Pine Street was seen jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others were seen blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The aid workers' union will sue the city over the layoff
Unions representing hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. They argue that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminated against because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is likely the last option left to the District Council 37 unions in their bid to overturn the dismissal decision.
On the seventh of October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators, and other employees who were among the lowest-paid employees of the city lost their jobs. They described their dismissal as retaliation by the city for not giving him access to a health care fund managed by labor crews last spring to plug a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically denied the allegations.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the board members immediately countered that nowhere specifically did the budget mention the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials said they had already filled out the necessary paperwork and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will call a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit in the Manhattan Supreme State Court.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight laid-off workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as are most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the lawsuit and would not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city to support their claims of unfair treatment. They believe that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while there were no layoffs at all in Staten Island schools and minimal layoffs in the Upper East Side, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in Brooklyn, District 23 in Brownsville, and 46 assistants were laid off in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
At Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants have lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents who can raise funds to make up for the budget deficit."
Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated bonus funds for each poor student enrolled.
Among other things, the unions say high school principals may have been confused by the way a document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers, whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been fired," the complaint motion states, "and not just moved to the database as available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before that could happen, however, the revolution had to succeed, the long-reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of US troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will decide on a statement supported by Speaker John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) to congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and to thank the U.S. troops for their "bravery."
"With this statement, we want to acknowledge the courage of the Libyan people who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate involving Libya has been easy so far.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides have been constantly arguing with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of statements approving or rejecting the United States' military role in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Chamber of Deputies due to differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have stopped funding U.S. operations in Libya.
This left the U.S. mission in Libya literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama was managing the mission, but apparently did not irritate his members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitancy of the congress was eventually overtaken by other events.
Rebels captured Tripoli in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In a statement, the Commission on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their immense courage and admirable tenacity in liberating their people" and "commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces, as well as their allies, who participated in the operation to protect the Libyan population for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal gain the full support of the International Relations Commission, or will lawmakers again be divided into two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's leading representative on the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for nearly all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, championed by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other issue that will be voted on by the full House or Senate.
Other lawmakers, despite considerable efforts, have so far failed to push their proposals through to the actual vote.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that have been introduced in Congress and have touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to both the House and the Senate - and others are only minor variations of others.
In the House alone, there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment, and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents - especially emerging Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorship."
The budget regulation decree, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limits on the number of terms in which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms that can serve as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments that, among other things, would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage and an amendment banning the burning of the national flag remain permanent proposals.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be nullified if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in drafting various amendments, they are not significantly out of the ordinary compared to previous years.
In 111. Congress was offered 77 amendments, while 100 were offered to the Congress. There were 66 of them in Congress.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 90s of the 20th century, when, according to statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were not much more successful than contemporary politicians.
The last amendment that was added, the 27th Amendment, was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten, but not defeated," Gifford said in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after being wounded at point-blank range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow," and said she wanted to get well more than return to Congress.
Giffords appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer. It was obvious that she still had trouble forming sentences and needed help walking.
The entire programme documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that pierced her skull in front, penetrated the left half of her brain and came out of her head at the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to take a triumphant vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, forty-one-year-old Giffords replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on an episode of "20/20" that aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Tale of Courage and Hope."
The special followed Gifford's entire recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
Videos shot by Kelly during the first few weeks show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift a finger or two at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teach her how to perform simple tasks.
Nodding his head.
Lip pursing.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word, "toast," as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman sings along with a therapist to the tunes for Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just want to Have Fun" and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she has no memory of the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he didn't read newspaper articles about the shooting to Gifford until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
The suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missoura prison awaiting trial under the influence of forcibly administered drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
He revealed to Kelly Sawyer that at one point during her recovery, his wife said, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly said.
"You just got a pickle.
But you can do it, pull yourself together and come back stronger than ever."
Military units are met with compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless New York veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines gathered around him.
The festively dressed crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring fundraiser.
The gala evening was also attended by the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was on site, but he saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
"All were presented as some kind of orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know I do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was a regret.
Such very opposite impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and the often reserved, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is showered endlessly with praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise comes at a cost, the soldiers say.
Increasingly, the public is behaving as if they feel sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops returning from Vietnam was far worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken quietly and privately among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat as Marines, their father warned them that people outside the military would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement, having defeated the enemy insurgents and visiting exotic places.
But others will wonder if "there's an evil, violent veteran lurking beneath the surface," said Cancian, who saw combat in Iraq and took his place in the government in Washington upon his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, some of the people who interviewed him subtly hinted at whether he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from combat.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to expect negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
Part of the military's concern stems from America's indifference to war.
Success on the battlefield rarely garners recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own military and finds little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was during World War II," said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public has focused mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are honored for the number of actions they endured, the number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to crack down on rape
A decision will be made this week on whether to open a lawsuit against the military against 28 women and men for alleged inaction in a rape case.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to file a lawsuit.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her military colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they could drink a little in her room.
"A warning light came on in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, 'No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await the verdict of a hearing that could have historic implications. That will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will be about whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which violates the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington attorney Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. Over the following months, however, the number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their military colleagues and that the military has failed to investigate, punish or seek justice after the attacks were reported.
Burke says she's at the throat of the military's top brass because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to take action against such acts? High Command."
Burke also says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case — putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says — she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if the pressure doesn't let up.
The team defending the Department of Defense is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who along with his associates filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy — essentially meaning that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
However, things have changed since the fifties.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, this is just a quibble: in modern wars, it is hard to find a clear front line.
In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communicating with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers died - two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to modernize, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her struggle. In addition to her, three other lawyers are dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly fostering an atmosphere that fosters hatred of women.
Independently, the nonprofit organization of American Vietnam veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military. The lawsuit focuses on a diagnosis of "personality disorder" allegedly found in rape victims to give the military an excuse to release them — a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights activists called Service Women's Action Network.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the state's Veterans Meeting Organization, accusing it of discriminatory practices in processing requests for help from individuals who claimed to have been sexually assaulted while on duty.
Nine separate bills were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and representatives from both political parties, proposing a number of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defense's Office of Preventing and Addressing Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, that number corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, issued in March, also discusses the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to court - half of the civilian justice system.
Prosecutors describe the attacks in Burke's case as just the first of a series of traumas.
Private First Class Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to have happened.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine rape, and her attacker's blood was found in her bed - from a wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as witnesses of the rumor in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman said.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there on the spot – I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his trial. He was mine."
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and thus without retirement.
Whether or not the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors moves to the next stage, it's a long shot, said John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law University.
But, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of the discussion."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is several decades behind because their responsibilities do not provide for the same level of incentives and deterrences.
He adds: "The odds are tough against them... But it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not rule in their favor, Burkevoa, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people ready to file a lawsuit and begin working on other cases related to the issue.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue from where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Researching You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man to present his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to a July killing spree that left 77 people dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was by no means alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just hit Facebook.
"We realised that getting them wasn't that hard at all," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent British research team's report on European digital populism.
Facebook's stock of personal information is so extensive, Bartlett says, that researchers simply used advertising on the site to pinpoint the demographic they were looking for — something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, then focused attention on them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of inviting them to join a new group or offering them diet products, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, their attitude towards violence, and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not all that surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are irritated by rising levels of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and policy researchers use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends hidden behind status updates, posts on walls, and pressed "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them provides three different pieces of data per day, making the social network an "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers with the word Facebook in their titles has risen to almost 800% compared to five years ago.
For some researchers, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the ability to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be that if you wanted to do a survey of people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side, but they'd never let you in," Bartlett says.
"Facebook is taking all of that away — you just go straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid socio-health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that college students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were much more at risk for the problem of alcoholism than students who kept silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that students' peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"You can't solve the problem if you can't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children at risk that we otherwise wouldn't have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself is constantly probing the data of its users.
The site's information team has compiled statistics on the connection between relationship statuses and St. John's Day. Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010, and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - advocates of Internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available for research to others).
But Facebook users know that the site follows them whether they like it or not — in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
Scientists have clear rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users even thought that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it that the information was only between them and their friends."
Subsequently, the question of methodology is also considered.
Even with offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, there is no way to verify how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tools to use in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities – and a hell of a lot of social activities are still happening offline."
'Cold and inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who pleaded guilty to masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told the court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you have been mandated by organizations that promote the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I admit no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use the hearing as a platform from which to voice his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and announced that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept firmly locked up.
All participated in order to move the case to an early conclusion.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," one survivor of the attack told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. Entering and leaving the building, he looks the journalists and survivors in the eye without difficulty.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge found that he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
It may be comforting to some that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically lessen the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If so, everything would be a lot easier."
7 Lessons from the Lost Steve Jobs Interview in Movie Coming to Theaters This Week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people began to emerge who compared him to Henry Ford - and voted him the greatest modern inventor for his genius.
What will be true about Jobs' recently rediscovered interview, which was dusted off for a special coming to theaters this week, for Apple fans, is that his creative mind had a perfect understanding of the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who fine-tuned every little detail – he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that 90 percent of their work is a really great idea... [But] between a great idea and a great final product, there is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show The Triumph of Computer Fools, about the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than hour-long interview took place.
By then, it had been a decade since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, anxiously awaiting the general public's adoption of the Internet.
In the end, only a short portion of Cringely's entire interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to select theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is notorious for his reluctance to give longer interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly excited to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
And he also proves to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there is a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs thinks through the answer perfectly to make it as concise and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, when he seems impatient with Cringely's questions and drives him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, and iPhone, and features frighteningly prophetic thoughts as Jobs assesses what other companies are doing right and wrong, while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It wasn't long before he had put his ideas into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"In my years in business, I've always asked, 'Why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, they never think deeply about business-related things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way costs were recorded - they often began with the inscription "standard costs", the amount of which he could only guess. At that point, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine trading costs in no time.
How he performed a mischief on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a telephone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
Much has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone, and during the call they were transferred from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've weaved around the world at least half a dozen times, so when we shouted something into a paid phone, it came from the other phone at the door a minute later," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we found that we could build something on our own that could drive billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger giant – it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would have been created without it.
Jobs goes on to describe the prank he and Wozniak almost pulled to the end. They called the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asked if they could speak to the Pope, posing as Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, increasingly senior members of the Catholic Church were called in to speak with an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke the Pope himself to the phone, the pair chuckled and hung up the receiver.
How he fell in love with technology (and was on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked up Bill Hewlett's number in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had already secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"She influenced me unbelievably. It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I went higher and higher at HP, hanging around that computer and starting to write programs for it.
How they invent innovations:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he went to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together an entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the challenges they faced developing a computer mouse:
"I remember arguing quite wildly... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], until I got tired of it, and I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are running out of breath:
Long before he led Apple's resurrection, Jobs wisely predicted that many industry leaders would waver in their vision and lose market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing dominate, so companies are headed by people who are in charge of this, while people in charge of their own products are excluded from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led the company to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, it could have been the Microsoft of the nineties...
Instead of winning, however, they made a loss.
How he takes innovation as an art form:
"There is still a long way to go and a lot of work between a great idea and a great final product... And as that great idea evolves, it changes and grows."
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a number of compromises - certain things you just can't force electrons, glass, robots or factories to do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
At the end of the day, it depends on taste—you try to think of the best things humanity has ever created, and in a way you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so amazing and successful because the people who worked there were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technology, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act while their case was heard in court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to challenge President Obama's health care bill, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will attend the hearing.
The incident occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the motions filed.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit. But a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, the outcome of which will further stir up the presidential election, scheduled for 2012 and in full swing by the time the decision is made.
The lawyer who will go to court and try to get the law rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a longtime advocate for conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called Freedom Party. National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel hours after a court hearing on the case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican's top representative in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the health care bill.
And the listed guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The pair of judges have been participating in Federalist Society events for years.
And it is certainly not anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the principles of conduct to which inferior federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "a judge may attend events that are currently being organised by related and other organisations to raise funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be featured on the agenda of the event."
Still, Scalia and Thomas' relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the company with a huge financial interest in the case, was amply enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to code of conduct contradicts the assertion by several justices that the Supreme Court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined at a social benefit along with lawyers who are awaiting their case to be heard in court."
Their presence and help in raising funds through this action undermines any claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, telling them that they, too, had no problem combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that the ethical problem lies primarily with Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was serving as attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Kagan's critics have pressured her to renounce her involvement in the case, saying she fought for the law too much then to be disinterested now.
Kagan gave no indication that she was going to step down.
Boeing wins record $18 billion jet order
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets, with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it is collecting more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 of its products, it's usually no cause for celebration.
But if that company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and those 50 planes together cost a record $18 billion, that's a different story.
Equally important is where Boeing got the contract from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its largest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft — 50 two-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The sensational order came from Dubai-based Emirates airlines.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline has the option to purchase an additional 20 planes, bringing the total value of the contract to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes called Dreamliners, that boast significantly improved fuel economy and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company," Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar, told Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but the rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself profits from higher oil prices.
That's important because they're not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone plane orders because of fuel price increases, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Emirates order consolidates Boeaing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and puts Airbus SAS on a tight spot to try to challenge Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus announced the first flight of its largest aircraft, the A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER.
The postponement was due to the fact that customers wanted a greater payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more power to the engine.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister appears to have been defeated in the Michoacán election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, PRI's Fausto Vallejona, was helped by drug traffickers in his hunt for the governorship.
Felipe Calderona's sister appears to have lost the violent state election for governor of Michoacán. On Monday, she said one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug dealers.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the governors' election of the western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interference of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process, and especially in yesterday's elections, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... They confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let people vote on order for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
But he plans to return to power soon, and winning the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly defeated Calderon, who was leading the day before the election.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's National Action Party, or PAN, Conservative party, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governorship. For the fractious and unlucky party, this is a very unfortunate defeat before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state's capital, Morelia, denies any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderon's home state and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew out of the election out of fear.
But, whatever the outcome of the Michoacán election looks like for the PRI, a victory will help the party gain new impetus.
The expected representative of the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto from Wahington congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help rescue the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, lest there be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, chief executive of Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all Europe's problems "too unexcitedly" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and resources, would help stave off a long-term global economic meltdown.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is suitable," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they definitely should."
The European Monetary Grouping has been severely tested by a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's growing debt crisis has raised fears that it could drag the global economy back into recession, and there have been calls for emerging leading economies to come together to help the eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, an institution for European financial stability - would give Asian partners of European countries greater bargaining possibilities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high growth rate."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that emerging economies such as India's have no business helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to India's 1.2 billion people when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find that Greeks retire at fifty and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would be hard to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis threatened a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a "downside risk" due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must develop "contingency plans" to protect themselves from downturns and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave Congress a hard time on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and set off a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next decade, but now fears a further $600 billion cut if Congress fails to strike a deal on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the entire department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress's failure to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23 percent blanket decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this imprudent way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy just three-quarters of a building or a ship. In addition, it could seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is to happen so quickly, we will almost certainly have to send civilians on furlough to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care for our military and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, combat troops will also be affected, Panetta said.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this garnish, operations there will be negatively impacted by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in negotiated contracts supporting our people's war efforts."
"The number of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of legal and political support."
The two senators wrote back to Panetta ten days ago, asking for details about the possible impact on automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a strike at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this harsh measure," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign up to it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplify the voices calling for the Pentagon to be left off the list of cuts.
Panetta has been increasingly open about possible cuts lately, even though he had moved to a senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience approving congressional and White House budgets, so he knew he was engaged in a tough fight.
At a press conference held one minute week, the defense minister outlined a brief picture of what his department could expect - the shell of the army, but inside which the core will be missing.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"It will be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It will be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morale, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an annex supplied with the letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how reductions will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts, and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibility of airborne and deployment around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could face completion, including those already being tested and those in the early stages of planning.
The list included a project for the F35, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines wanted to replace the humvee.
Halting further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but proponents say it is a necessary next step in military upgrades needed to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A cursory glance at recent headlines tells us how serious and pervasive lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy alleging that he sexually harassed several women — both sides say the other is lying.
Penn State administrators were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught with his microphone down telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed entire careers and shaken the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using campaign funds to try to conceal his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that revolved around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating at school and university abound.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers, just to make them look good in their testimonials.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases in a single day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Identifying lies, or "recognizing lies," is an essential skill that everyone should learn, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it's not a parlor game that's like, say, a Charade where you shout, "I've got you." Deception recognition is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
Liars calmly look you in the eye.
It's not like they're stuttering, stuttering, blushing, or fidgeting.
But don't assume that liars are difficult to spot and expose.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
Having spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from the vast and evolving lie recognition industry, it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can be of great help in today's complex world – especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars are good at reading others, letting their guard down, directing their emotions, and intuitively realizing how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more "aimed at others" lies—mostly to protect someone's feelings—that married people lie to their partners less often than single people (though the lies they tell are usually "outrageous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, later findings will have something to compare with.
Note the posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone routinely taps their feet all the time so you don't wrongfully accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their foot in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But take this only as a warning sign, not as proof of a lie.
People telling a lie may stop moving their upper body when trying to remember their made-up story, they may turn the toes of their shoes to the door, lean toward the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "relief after the conversation" — exaggerated relief and change position when the difficult confession is behind them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like when it's over.
Also perceive the subject's language.
There is a famous story about how Scott Peterson once misspoke and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which sparked a nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals may also express themselves in a measured manner: "I had no sexual relationship with this lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal signs are very subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "palliative language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
We don't get much of a factual in such an answer, and it's often another warning sign.
There is no magic to detect every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills to spy on a lie.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and cheater in his personal and professional way.
A controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after threats to delay approval by the US government emerged
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — pitting unions against itself but reassuring environmentalists — the company in charge of building the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it will move the pipeline's planned route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident the project will still be approved.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska government headquarters.
Alex Pourbax, a representative of TransCanada, said the company was confident that the pipeline would eventually be approved, even though it would take a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was delaying a decision on federal approval for the project, from which it would not conduct studies of possible alternative routes to avoid encroachment on the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is really moving forward," Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year's election, but authorities deny that politics played a role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
700,000 barrels of oil flow daily from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This path will have to cross 6 states.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but loved by work crews who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan and considered laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the department's inspector general had commissioned a rereview of the entire original study process, focusing mainly on two issues.
One was whether TransCanada-hired lobbyist Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, posed a conflict of interest in the program.
Another is whether the firm that was hired to conduct the original study was not inappropriately chosen because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making a toddler vomit in fear
A New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle stormed the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter into vomiting.
The singer's performance on "Lady Marmalade" scared eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "heightened fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk pulled up the car, Roseanna Monk went down with her luggage to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard house, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she paused at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?'" I said 'yes' and left to pick her up."
LaBelle reprimanded the pregnant woman irritably.
"In an aggressive tone, she told me, 'You shouldn't put your daughter by the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I'm not interested in your opinion.'"
She became enraged and began to speak vulgarly - shouting loudly the most vulgar expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her and started splashing water from it.
She claims that Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother — who still had Genevieve in her arms — and was only stopped by her escort, who then dragged her into a waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
Meanwhile, the daughter was screaming so hard she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson have not responded to our calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took up the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all of the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially when directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child."
Climate Toughness Slows Down the Economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined, and with it the economy
The year 2011 will go down in Sinaloa's economic history. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse weather conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and there has even been a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, are responsible for a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. Agriculture experienced a historic decline of 31.16%, disrupting the momentum of other economic sectors as well.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% was found to be partially damaged. The main destroyed crops include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state's unemployment rate has seen an increased increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28%, and between July and August the average unemployment continued to rise, reaching 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed increased by 18,969 persons.
Less liquidity
Unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa is due to several factors. According to Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the public policy level.
"We are seeing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation passed by Congress in the context of the fight against money laundering. It's not easy for people who illegally take possession of dollars, to earn them, to invest them or to use them for something," he said.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also contributing to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficulty of entry and because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to find work. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the area of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the state's employed population works without paying benefits to the Social Security Administration.
Unemployment and unreliability are compounded by other features of the labour market, such as low wages. This administrative area has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas through September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, 2011 also saw the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the January-June period, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697, a decrease of 87.74% from the amount of $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government reports investments of 17, 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to service businesses.
Debt
In the context of a downturn scenario, the state's government asked the state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to boost the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. Until November, no gains on debt were recorded in any sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to business sector representatives, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government highlighted the government's lack of management skills.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"Economic development in Sinaloa has been really small this year. We must work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. We have to redouble our efforts in 2012, there has been a lack of harmonisation of all our efforts and, in particular, of the correct and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
The slowness of the economy
Loredo López said events such as the frost at the beginning of the year brought the state's economy to a standstill and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamism that would have allowed an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services to be achieved. Therefore, at the end of the year, we were well below the expected forecasts," he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we see that work is being done. We believe that it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the material and human resource potential that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work ahead of us
Chairman Coparmex stressed the importance of setting out a vision for the future that better guides the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some advances in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that there is a lot of work to be done and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted of 8kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican Army forces on June 7, 2010, while on patrol on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving a white pick-up truck. He had a black bag on a shelf in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detained man remained available to the Judges of the Second Department, and the proceedings remain internal within the Center for the Implementation of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
They owe contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programmes such as Hábitat, Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants face the risk of not being followed through or being long delayed due to a lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The city's director of social development said that if until now construction work has been moving forward, now there is a risk that the state government will not be able to secure the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He said the total investment in the three programs is nearly 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have provided funds for the work, so it is possible that there will be delays in the implementation of the projects.
"They are supposed to raise almost 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have received absolutely nothing. Even though we should have received part of it in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started the projects and they are progressing very successfully, but we lack money."
He said that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padillo, the state failed to fulfill the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan to pay more than 7 million that the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to these programs this year, we had to raise funds to cover what the state had not completed," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise from state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request has been sent to Armand Villarreal, Secretary for Administration and Finance, to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even received a peso yet."
Court approves 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) has dismissed a constitutional lawsuit brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against a presidential decree that seeks to speed up the so-called "shutdown of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He stated that the necessary eight votes had not been found to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mezo, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree listing the steps that will lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree in question was dismissed, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cødero herself voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described therein to lead to the digital transition.
The ministerial meeting also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal to the effect that the federal executive could not structure measures through general norms to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," noting that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogous signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitalisation, which requires decisions of public interest. Digitization has not only a technical dimension, but "also touches on economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he emphasized, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It encompasses a whole series of powers which the Constitution confers in the hands of the government of the State."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition and had done so through their governments, despite having highly specialised technical bodies at their disposal.
He stated that it is not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent encroaches on the sphere of congressional powers, to introduce into the area of administration the observance of laws prepared by the legislative branch.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to data published by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. The votes of 879 out of 6,074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is less than 27 percent, and the votes of 879 out of 6,074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a whole series of measures that should harmonize local norms with the federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed its political constitution, nor its State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Law. The State Congress passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire during this term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected to publish them within the deadline in the Official State Gazette Act, saying that he had some objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature, declaring the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "null and void" because he had the right to "neither approve nor veto" them.
When asked about the possibility of counting 'vote by vote', María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it would be possible for both partial and total counts to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, a partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, can be carried out under the following conditions: the election results do not match; there is no record of the counting and calculation in the relevant box or is not available to the President; or if there were mistakes and obvious violations of the election results.
Moreover, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes may be carried out if there is evidence that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place.
A total recount of votes may also be carried out if, after a proper count, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request by the political party whose candidate finished second. In this case, electoral packages that have been partially counted will be discarded.
It should be noted that this is the situation in the Morelia elections, where, according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. A solemn ceremony and a requiem mass will take place on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the others who died in the crash, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant-colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends had also arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., a farewell ceremony took place at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member in preparation for graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo, and his wish was that his ashes would be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. That's how he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the peak of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and entered the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it, saying he even drove a truck, but he always pursued his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
They gave him a final goodbye
We bid farewell to Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, with all the tributes that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in his studies,  so in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving crashed. Also on board were the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of that state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Saltillono native Bacio Cortés (cremated) arrived to be handed over via funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the command of Major Jaime Martinez, where his family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered in the meantime.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found at the farm of Cadereyta NL
Hours before the find, military officials presented to the media 11 people who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by gunfire on different parts of their bodies and heads were found on an abandoned farmhouse in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find occurred on a 1.5-kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the people was wearing a yellow sports T-shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him lay a man also in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying face down to the ground.
According to data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered in another place because no bullets were found.
Messages addressed by one organized crime group to another were found on the fence of the cottage, as well as a number of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained
The Secretary of National Defence introduced 11 people, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which has been linked to kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to published information, during the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one detainee was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were seized. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another raid took place at 6 a.m. on 12 November. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they spotted a car without license plates and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they searched and discovered one rifle, cartridge case and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was arrested at around 2 p.m. on 13 November. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burials in the villages of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet the Italian President tomorrow to present him with the new government that will face the crisis that is keeping the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Tomorrow, the appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet the Italian President to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that is holding the country on the brink of economic catastrophe and that has put the entire euro area at risk.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks he held with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has sent debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders. Only in this way will it be possible to restore Italy's damaged credibility.
There is a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry. Due to market volatility, interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with ten-year maturities exceeded the 7 percent mark, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would strongly support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this predicament.
Monti's hopes of success have been greatly multiplied thanks to support from Silvio Berlusconi's PDL, who was forced to resign by the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
Support for the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because, up to now, many of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority formed by Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support in order to push through unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
Italy's Foreign Banks Association has joined the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could spell disaster.
Monti began talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organizations on Monday.
The round of negotiations will conclude on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who allowed for rapid progress in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline late last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond rates have returned to critical levels, responding to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Rescuing Italy, whose public debt is €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the capabilities of the eurozone's current financial reserves.
Monti has said his government should stay in power until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms and then call early elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that the government must be composed only of experts to lead Italy out of the predicament the country has found itself in because of financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties was complicating the attempt to include political figures in the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the 50-match international barrier.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players called up reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on Costa Rica's side, if we compare the 22 players of both countries who met today for a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While world and European champions, number one on FIFA's monthly rating, have a wide range of Class A inter-selection matches to their name, Costa Rica only have defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to have played 50 international matches.
He reached that number last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star Game and the powerful English Premier League clubs, have been intensely active in league championships and domestic cups and high-level European Cup matches such as the Champions League for over a year.
To the previous we must also add the experience of the Spanish national team in complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has to his credit goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Costa Rica again today and set a new record for Spain with 127 international matches.
Barcelona's key player Xavi Hernández has 106 caps to his name.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week, along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches to their name. Among them the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke centre forward Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol also came close to a hundred with 97 matches.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and close to Michael Uman are left winger Júnior Díaz with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 surpassed the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Smallest number of matches.
With fewer than 30 appearances in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are in Spain.
On the national side with fewer than 30 games are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not even exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
David Villa is Spain's top scorer with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate twenty years of existence
"A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of the best shows at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We've waited more than 20 years, but the band says the chance to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for them.
So said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The band is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate twenty years of existence and on Sunday the 20th will be on a unique stop in Central America.
On this day, he will perform at 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium along with the angel group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on La Nación's website on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is also our dream that is coming true.
This is barely our second time in South and Central America and the experience so far has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once, on vacation. It is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the band here, the fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your staunchest supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in 21 years were created in a matter of weeks.
We put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this will get us in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
To be honest, we are looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to sneak pee, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And that's how we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you've put together a huge show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to perform the best possible show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat repertoire.
Why?
I think part of it is because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
That's how the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
With this tour you are celebrating 20 years of artistic career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, definitely.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and stay in it for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and we are moved that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we like to make music.
We are lucky to be able to see the places we have always longed for.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you to be a significant part of the emergence of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, which includes all the greats.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time a group is formed in a city, but it is much less common for five or ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud of that and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate that they are all our friends, and we are honored to be a part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt [Cameron] joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think firstly, we are all lucky to still be in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship with the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do whatever you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it became easier and easier to find a balance.
We try not to tour too much because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You must not get carried away by being a famous, rock star. Neither of us ever really cared about that.
How do you remember another Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and in the beginning it was something spectacular.
We existed as a band for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Band will be commissioned to open a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose them as opening acts?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas will offer live and they have to be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed [Eddie Vedder], so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
The first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all evening about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge even though it's no longer fashionable?
I think we've all always felt slightly separated from the word grunge.
When I think of grunge, I think of the bands I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others that were formed at the same time. And if that's still the way music is valid today, that's great, because it's music worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character, and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, even though they may sound positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a public hospital where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his attending physician said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including tongue cancer, for which he underwent four surgeries and is currently under control by doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases over three days to find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori could receive a pardon on humanitarian grounds, but the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and these problems were compounded by other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people who were killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his rule.
Mujica visits Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, business and representatives of the Uruguyan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a tax haven at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that continue to be tax havens will be excluded from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion from Uruguay and consultations with the ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has held the G20 presidency since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries. Since January this year, it has concluded an agreement on the exchange of information with the Latin American country to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not implemented all the required international standards for tax cooperation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D before: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, was created from the beginning to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how stereoscopy without glasses is supposed to work," said Omar Álvarez, a press specialist at Nintendo in Spain, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game created specifically for this medium" because to date, successful films such as "Star Fox 64 3D" and "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to the image being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" includes two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can embark on the "second round" at levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This new arrival of Super Mario in 3D also anticipates with the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula from previous parts. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, surroundings, disguises and also among enemies, the "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had moved forward on the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to answer in the United States for plotting to launder $70 million.
Thus ends a process aimed at Guatemala responding to a request from a northern country demanding Portillo's extradition so that it can try him.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision is in line with the independence of the judiciary and executive and that he remembers that the criminal court has already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he "did not interfere" in court decisions and allowed all extradition that came to his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a move of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead a trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights has been guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency. This process preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education so that they do not find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinijove social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion received help. The organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundreds of jobs that have been created for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet at a ceremony that took place in the former Fabra i Coats factory and was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in Trinitat Vella in 1986 to help young people with little education, no job, drug addiction or social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andrea was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified character of the work carried out by the Trinijos.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist adviser on education, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Ecological-Socialist Councillor Ricard Goma.
The grand hall of Fabra i Coats was also attended by the current advisor for social welfare and family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of social work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created in a very difficult time and that today's times also present a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to date "is a good foundation".
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
A seized house was evicted, where gigantic parties were held
The intruders appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the Balmes building, 51
The 12 occupiers left the house at noon yesterday without resistance
Everything indicates that the nightmare experienced by the neighbours of number 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday, where they organized gigantic parties to wake up neighbors. They left the building by order of the court and without the police having to intervene.
After the end of the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the caretaker said.
The occupiers who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly also the water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind garbage of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties were held, which lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales fell by 80% while the building was occupied.
The owner of the disco points out that the occupiers of the building made her unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of an entertainment venue had to respond to lawsuits from neighbors over noise. But the problems were not caused by visitors to the disco, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially by those who attended the parties organized here, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiving her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
Last week, Alberto Fernández Díaz, chairman of the PP People's Group, demanded that "the building be immediately evicted to put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by neighbours and the destruction of the area".
The leader of the People's Party explained that only one floor was occupied before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers have entered all floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there have even been thefts.
In this regard, he added that "impunity must be ended and consistent with the acts against civic responsibility that took place in the building."
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police entered Building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the proceedings, which entails more than a controversy over fees
The city's tender for 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, in the heyday of the defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the demise of CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper frontier of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not orient themselves on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 competitions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate is more in favour of the idea of a park.
Either this, or someone is trying to place a gate on the field.
The only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of reflections on the city, this question becomes a central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It's already as trite a topic as when two members of this old caste of the chosen ones shake hands when meeting in an elevator.
And it was this undertaking that sparked one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and the outgoing university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process is justified.
According to Roldán, after the question of the bay side was raised, "the mountain side should also be discussed", so Ildefons Cerdo's speech on green apples was not carried through.
"We have to start from the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", declared the architect, for whom the name "gateways to Collserol" implies a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to a park, but rather as defining zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, describes the design as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty represented today by the project of a public place" after the experience of the 80s, which had "its swan song" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step", that is, in principle, to move one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban planning and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
Looking at the question in more detail, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not end up in the rubbish heap", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his committee to intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in debate, but he "doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill," he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complex, because Collserolo's global vision is missing from the tender documents: "16 tenders have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This means that at least he applied for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may clash with the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the city hall should guarantee that the strip located immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide a full-length amenities zone that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardons Jonas Larrazábal, who will be fired
After 72 days of imprisonment, Cadino Red's legal commissioner granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after Casino Red's legal representative granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which heard the extortion case in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was indicted.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded that he pay an economic quota so that the Monterrey City Hall would allow an illegal operation in the betting house.
After a public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist Mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
He remained in this place for the next 49 days after the second detention order was issued and a Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was taken to the criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with the sum of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained in a medium-supervised prison for only a few hours because he received death threats.
Leaders allowed him to remain in city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to prove Jonah's guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed.
On Monday, Casino Red's legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina and asked for a pardon for the brother of the region's mayor. Based on this, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the companions had decided to grant a pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal. It will not be possible to file any complaint in the proceedings against him. It is also not possible to claim compensation for damages or punishment.
After a hearing with a legal representative around 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Bretón.
The registrar of the court, Jorge Yanéz, went to the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and that his case had been placed in the archives.
He also told him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed Cabinet Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people showed that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transport, said that before the plane took off, the pilot stated that the weather conditions allowed the flight.
"Parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings entangled in the branches of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost the hull."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he stated that as a result of an investigation conducted in the area of impact, no parts were found on the ground.
"During the search, it was found that the parts of the aircraft were not located in another location, so the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a normal overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome listed six main points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in AICM indicate adequate conditions during takeoff, accordingly the aircraft is advancing towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico were visible cloud layers at low altitudes.
Routes selected:
It is likely that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar record of the helicopter match, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory before the impact.
Distribution of aircraft remains in a limited area:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A diagram of the dispersion of the remnants of the aircraft indicates that the helicopter was whole at the time of impact on land.
No fire or explosion was reported.
No evidence was recorded at the crash site to suggest that an explosion or fire had occurred.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage in which there was probably a breakup along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After careful searching in the vicinity of the accident, in an area that is larger than the area of demarcation, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still whole.
Mexico's Health Insurance Institute has begun research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to uncover a gene that causes obesity in children and youth. The research, entitled "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents", will allow to obtain results regarding overweight.
In the report, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been established.
This team relies on the support of specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, whether or not authorized, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Mexico City, where teenage tests will be performed every day from 8 a.m.
He pointed out that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexican State) and since October 8, this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics when it comes to the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) are performed on all participants, blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglicerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined and genes are examined (genes are tried to identify genes that are involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflects health professionals' concern about the alarming increase in children's weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, there was a 77% increase in obesity for boys alone and 47% for girls. There has also been a dramatic increase in the case of overweight', the IMSS expert said.
He said that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the population of a country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive an overall assessment of the children's condition, thereby determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetes conditions.
The information is still confidential, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to avoid their children's disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle meaning a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day, and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also caused by a large caloric intake, that is, greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and genetic load, which is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in the asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the pavement was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair almost 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Valle de Mexico Metropolitan Area, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, potholes would be significantly reduced or even eliminated altogether.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Potholes, which he gave as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should create a mixture that has similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce pothole formation.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a collection of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules called asphaltenes, and others with low molecular weight, which are called mortenes. Together, they give asphalt its typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a fluid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but varies during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Between the uppermost layers there is an asphalt liner, formed by small pebbles embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that makes up the insert is covered with asphalt.
When cars pass or when creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to be well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, they would decompose even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer, called the shell, will be placed on the asphalt liner, made up of fine stones, i.e. sand also embedded in the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have greater mechanical force than asphalt liner and must ensure road friction.
Due to the fact that as part of the paving it will be subjected to heavy loads, the cladding must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. Water in particular has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt liner.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inwards and it is difficult for it to get out, causing all layers of pavement to soften and thus create potholes.
He explained that during the formation of potholes, the film of the shell is first damaged, and only then the asphalt liner is damaged. However, damage does not happen in a single moment, but is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that vehicle loads are another important factor in potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must match the load on the vehicles and ensure that this load is not exceeded. This is the only way to prevent frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to be done on asphalt and the research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, bituminous emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow us to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valle lack to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not win the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first vicemiss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winners' podium, winning the silver crown and sash, which made her the new first Vice-Miss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which Miss Atlántico won and took the scepter, the department won the 14th title of the first vicemiss. Melina joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually declared the first vice-misses. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question that many are asking. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has what it takes to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing became the Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took home the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name her only First Vicemiss is the fact that she was not convinced by her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Leamos literary editors.
When asked, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I am a great believer in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me the most as a child was "The Little Prince," a very profound book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was disliked both because of the term "culturalize" and because the candidate did not explain what the various books in question had affected her.
After the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and pleased with the result: "The world is wise, what should happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the start the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who had won all the previous awards (the Oster Gastronomic Challenge, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) aroused the envy of other female contenders, stressed the queen, who then failed on the scene.
This was evident during the first swimsuit presentation on the Hilton beach and during the two parades leading up to the final coronation.
Although she shone on both of them, it was obvious that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Like at Home" program on RCN Canal, believes that Melinda's winning the title of first vice-miss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up with the crown of queen.
In addition, Valle has been rather unkind to the media in recent days, and this has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Pageant.
As an aside, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social conscience. It is important that female candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
There is also speculation that candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was evident on her buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which voted her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on her buttocks, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took points away from her on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the Valle native made a mistake when she underwent several surgeries.
"The surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't work in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here it took its toll."
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, after the swimsuit show, there was a cruel prediction that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo gave Melina so that he would not have to award her the highest crown in the end.
Whether this is true or not, what is certain is that Melina today began the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the impressive success in Cartagena, did not get to the highest crown.
Such was the work of a resident of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Can
A fingerprint expert from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the Farc: "Alfons Cano", through a fingerprint comparison.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, it was the turn of Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has worked in forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to rummage through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses were that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital Valle and, after completing the relevant courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of friction of the skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of the operation against said Alphonse Cano, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he set off for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmiro.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. He was asked to take a fingerprint card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the place where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it because of its physical appearance. He looked completely different from what he did in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Along with a galton magnifying glass, ink and a transplanter, and a light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with those from the card.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the Puerto Tejado-born man was instructed to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón whether he was indeed the commander-in-chief of the Farc.
Search for clues
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, these people help in research into crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identities of those caught.
When they are caught, many offenders present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to obtain a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in a murder case.
Not long ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
As a result of the investigation, it was determined that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the imprint on the bottle confirmed this.
Although it cannot be confirmed for sure that he was indeed a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of a crime.
A fingerprint expert from CTI explained that the fingerprints of objects are "wiped off using chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to collect them.
The fingerprints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians at the moment whose data is not recorded anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in the CSI television program.
Just as everything that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
'The indignados' protest in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large number of them waited for orders to vacate the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square with a court order, from where they were escorted out in the morning. Then they tried to occupy another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order allowing the "indignant" to return to camp on the spot. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the lawful battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen for the "Occupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray said the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of the camp, ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the site and allowing protesters to continue camping there.
In addition, the "indignados" seized another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the site of the rectory at Trinity Church.
They managed to take up space for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the demonstrators. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw handcuffs were also placed on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious leaders also came to express support and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected on Tuesday to analyse the legality of the morning evacuation.
Some of the relocated protesters even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to officers guarding the square, sparking "some small clashes," Bray said, denouncing the fact that some police beat the protesters.
The injunction prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or from applying "laws that were published after the annexation began, or from banning protesters from a park with shops or other places they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of the court order, the city has suspended the reopening of public spaces, warning protesters that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the early eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and which was resorted to because the demonstrators were "breaking the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to be evacuated because it was becoming "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases hurt others," because "some stores received threatening letters" and "neighbors were worried about their quality of life."
"The early eviction was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not valuing freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they plan to organize "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and labor organizations to commemorate the two months that the protests have lasted. They began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will portray Our Lady in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, embodying the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from internet home pornography, appears with her ex-husband, the engine of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Santa Claus in a manger.
Appearing on the scene as Joseph is Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American descent who recently served as a presenter on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas broadcast of CTV will feature Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March and is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan comes back to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending a period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that grew into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has had to face since World War 2.
Early estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, between July and September the GDP value was in such a position that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese the tax year begins in March 2012 - assume the highest growth rate compared to the period January-March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery that is needed to rebuild areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, Japan's real awakening of the economy stems solely from the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to emerge stronger or to rebuild infrastructure. It is about using a shortage to start from scratch.
Japan woke up. This is mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to an increase in spending on vehicles, trips and leisure activities.
Stigma of yen
The flows were put in the hands of the internal market as the yen - Japan's currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a heavy burden on exporting businesses.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large tech groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their poor results in July-September to the yen exchange rate.
While markets continue to besiege the EU's peripheral countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen," State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts rigidities in the world economy has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing.
It fell four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even fallen below the average of 100. It got up to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be passed, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty once again taking hold, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth leading to an exit from Europe's major debt crisis.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new transitional Greek government is due more to the demands of Brussels than to the true convictions of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days he was given when he was appointed was likely to be short for their application, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, declared that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections to be called for the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, a reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does nothing to clear up doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The Conservative leader went a little further in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are supposed to unblock the $8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, however, he said that he would not support or sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
The European Commission, already enraged by the impact of Papandreou's referendum games, stressed yesterday that its demands were insurmountable: it would not unblock any aid unless the new government and leaders of the main parties signed a "written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" and negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of the $8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
The Greek spinner still has a moment to knit from.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has 'achieved a prominent position at global level in microfinance'.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor to the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It is a tool based on trust in man."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Micro-Loan Summit in Valladolid with the belief that there is "no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting targets to reduce by half the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the amount that sets the poverty threshold."
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and is taking this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which runs until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially women", for whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have already achieved a great deal" and "many challenges are still ahead".
The micro-credit summit is intended to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform to promote the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to rise above the poverty threshold below which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus", embarked on this journey, the Queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
She described the instrument's father as "an admirable idealist who embarked on a journey to fight poverty." She was introduced to his work 15 years ago when she travelled to Bangladesh to learn about his lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to see a constant development," explained the Queen, who thanks to her support for this project yesterday earned the title of "head of the family" granted to her in Valladolid by the "movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia concluded by inviting participants to engage in discussions and finding solutions to enable the fight against poverty to continue.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must abide by.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only to the period of balohobyt, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent "a serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty," and now more than ever, advanced-country governments must work in accordance with solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to fall victim to austerity.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success of the concept of giving confidence to people to whom everyone else is closing doors. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants to a city that "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious."
CDU proposes to elect the European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place in Leipzig on Monday 14 November without serious difficulties for Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it was only on the agenda in the autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal on the President of the European Commission submitted by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
A few minutes of standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel's speech and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the answer to the crisis is 'not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
According to the chancellor, "the time has come for changes" in Europe.
This could be expressed in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon allowing for greater control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of euro area member states, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage 'with the aim of giving Europe a single face'.
This, in any case, is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom opposes, and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a large majority a proposal to rate the weight of each country on the board of directors of the European Central Bank according to the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of Germany's weight.
Concerned about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it did not try to win Congress over by talking about "small" European states or states in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle near Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes disability fraud?
After the subsidies, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Assistance Office, where he will give a speech on a recurring theme since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
To accompany this offensive, which is based on the will to make austerity in a context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the perspective of a right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to concentrate on sick leave.
First, in order to save money, the government intends to impose a fourth day of sick leave on private sector workers before they start taking sick benefits.
To put it clearly, without the consent of the enterprise, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in €280 million.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic scope: giving civil servants one day of unpaid sick leave (until now they have no sick leave compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching the issue of fraud, this time focusing on abuses linked to sick leave.
"The checks will be much more extensive and, moreover: if you are caught, you will return," warned Xavier Bertrand in an interview given to RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth about wrongdoing in sick leave.
In fact, these have been subject to constant surveillance since 2002 and the political onslaught that has borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's first look at a few official figures.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than €237 million in daily compensation was paid out in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily reimbursements accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity benefits and accidents at work, and 54% to sick leave, i.e. €6.2 billion.
Thus, only 2.5% of health costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of sick leave in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that conceals some variations: another survey published in 2007 on job opportunities Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they had not chosen a day of sick leave.
Another study, this time conducted by sickness insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of sick leave was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared to their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to sick leave than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Center) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absenteeism (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% in France, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on sick leave is only a very small part compared to undeclared work.
As for fraud, these are only on a small scale.
Strengthened legislation since 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks aimed at sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that in 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 performed due to short-term incapacities were "unjustified or too long," i.e., 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were counted at 1.2 million checks, or 132,000.
In total, there were 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million employees who were on sick leave.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a June report on the issue, this figure would represent between €9 billion and €15 billion missing from tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than fraud related to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the prime minister said as he delivered his first public speech at the opening of a confidence vote debate in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos projected that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product between now and the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support on Monday for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but said his party was not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for reducing deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are opposed to any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that would support the measures envisaged, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalised, says expert commission
According to a report by the Royal Society of Canada, Canadians are denied death.
On palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of death denial.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions along those lines.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The commission recommends that the government amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if such a choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent poll by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with a mandate from the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the wish to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec the figure is the highest with 86% of people dying in hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who have also scrutinized all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuses in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons who are not competent or disagreed.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday more than numerous cases of these errors in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that, according to a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, believing that it will allow end-of-life people to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia won't mean we're sending the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are worth less.
When it comes to people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the report's authors say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Panel of Experts also requires that specialist doctors be trained to respect end-of-life refusal of treatment without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, on palliative or final palliative or final soothing already widely used in Canadian healthcare facilities, the Commission requests that it be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already voiced reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the report's signature experts as "extreme" because, among other things, it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over the age of 18 could ask to be helped commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who read the report's summary yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that it seems as if the report's authors place the autonomy of the person above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a 'manifesto for euthanasia'.
Margaret Somerville, herself a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, questions the report's data on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus speaks of a 'conspiracy'
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on the Syria of President Bashar al-Assad, who with the support of Russia resists them and speaks of a "plot" against his country, intensified.
Two days after Syria's suspension of the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, have taken a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "hand over power" in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts made by Turkey to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough line.
The United States rejoiced in "strengthening the consensus against Assad and the dishonesty of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" to the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, during this time, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in the town of Deraa in southern Syria.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in gun battles and concentrated heavy machine gun fire in the town of Jobar" in the Homs area.
Yet at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "embarked on a path out of the crisis."
Indeed, he reacted vividly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow," he added, assuring that "the plots plotted against Syria will not succeed."
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favor of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a regime he says is "paranoid."
A new special meeting of the League is being called for tomorrow in Rabat to take a stand on the plan for resolving the crisis decided on 2 December, which envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from towns plagued by disputes and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "wrong," while China urged Syria to accept the plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifice from Italians
Italy's next prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and implement a program that includes "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the final months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner held talks with the political parties yesterday before meeting representatives of trade unionists and employers today.
He should form a relatively lean cabinet composed of technocrats who do not belong to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important program with many victims," Francesco Nucara, an MP from one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, said after meeting the prime minister-designate.
Chamber of Deputies President Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will conclude with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Yesterday, Mario Monti commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, precise deadlines apply" when it comes to the government's preparation and program, he stressed, adding that he was "sure that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially well received by markets, but concerns resurfaced after an unexpected slump in euro area industrial production in September.
The appointed prime minister should put together a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he has stressed that he would also like to recruit "politicians".
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, the date of the next elections.
According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a confidence vote in parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and to make Italy "once again a strong link" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy remains unchanged."
The European Union is convinced that Rome, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in 2013 and is demanding tough new measures.
Emma Marcegaglio, head of the business association Confindustria, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot adhere to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence, a 'professor' symbolising 'call to respectability' and 'another Italy', according to the editorials, represents an 'epochal change' for Italy after 17 years of 'Berlusconism'.
The big unknown will be the lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place €200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for an atomic weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in atomic risks announced Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "grave concerns" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws extensively on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (b. 1934) should have worked for three decades from the sixties at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), where he was supposed to be engaged in the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to leave the centre to set up a nano-diamond company in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was to work on the Iran program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear indications that Iran's development of the detonation system" was based "on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew the method well, but who, as one member state informed the agency, had worked during a substantial part of his working career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, crimes and crimes targeting Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little more.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase over 13% for violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease for offenses against Jews, and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," the human rights group Human Rights First stressed, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, a senior executive at the organization.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reporting on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legal system was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of its successors, somewhat resembling its Facebook services.
The new "activity" and "name" menus allow you to better and directly know the activity of other people who follow you or whose tweets you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to follow posts, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before being rolled out to the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeatedly distributing someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable and celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately judge the importance of this innovation differently in their "tweets".
"It's unnecessary, takes up a lot of space, and is too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter," he posted @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Writing the Golden Balance Rule into the Constitution
The government of the grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a "golden rule" of budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's rating by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting, in a situation where Austria's public debt, at 74.6%, is well above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but much lower than that of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one notch from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest every year," argued Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger, a Democrat of the Wings.
Austria thus follows the request of the Eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of a balance in the public accounts be written into a constitution or law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and from 2017 onwards, the federal state's public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder as well as municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if the yen were to continue strengthening.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen recovered to historic levels that forced Japanese authorities to intervene on Oct. 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently broke the dollar record since 1945.
But only since then has it risen regularly, supported by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of the global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar recovered below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of Japanese currency hurts the island's exports, making it more expensive for Made in Japan products and reducing the value of the income that Japanese firms receive from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Noda, who fears that this increase in the price of the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world's third economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% from the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of export growth and consumption growth in disaster-stricken households.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect "Japan's national economy."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which began a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's vice governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, said the BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" indicating that no additional currency weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Issuance Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and raised to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling it dedicates to purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
Rates rise, stock exchanges fail
The risk of contagion to the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock markets, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are plunging into negative expectations today on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris at 10 am, the CAC 40 index lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions over borrowing yields from troubled eurozone states, equity markets around the world continue to yield only part of the recent gains."
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop suffered due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and exchange will continue only along a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-ignition of uncertainties about the future of the eurozone is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is hitting its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 am, the European currency is worth $1.3570 with a 0.4% retreat.
According to brokers, the currency retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday envisaging the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield on Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of Italy's future government, Mario Monti, has urged the markets to redress the situation in Italy, which is threatened by poisoning caused by the size of its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be his government's "main task".
Spain is once again in a deliberate market line as the country holds elections to the Chamber of Deputies on Sunday.
The rate difference ("spread") between ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
In anticipation of the figures announcing euro area growth
Statistics say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, driven mainly by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, INSEE, France's national institute for statistics and economic studies, revised down second-quarter figures to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries economists most.
For its part, Germany registered growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is one issue that cannot be grasped on short-term balance sheets or under emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural that the meeting at the elections should be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place occupied by the energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause a doubling of electricity demand between now and 2050, unless we want to deprive a significant part of the world's population of an important part of life.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be tackled in order to continue generating electricity, not forgetting the imperative need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to combat climate change, a topic that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany stands alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
However, this is not the case for Belgium, which is making its decision conditional on the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the latest generation of power stations.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, are continuing with their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its fleet by one unit by resuming construction of one plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European wind power champion, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which has made CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay electricity bills 40% more than those paid by French households.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the advantages of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they are fundamentally opposed to this energy, as opinion polls show.
Let us recall that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 related jobs.
A strong exporting sector is dragging a large number of SMEs to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be offshored.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the €6 billion a year that the country receives for exporting nuclear equipment and services.
What plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years while its manufacturer was scheduled to go bankrupt?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, or even a diabolical one.
The development of low-CO2 installations, nuclear installations and installations using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group AREVA shows the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute necessity.
In France, we have the National Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power stations, as well as of the construction of the new power station in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place under normal traffic conditions and remained without human casualties or consequences for the environment.
At Chernobyl, the drama was caused by reactor designs and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident as it did from the previous two.
The fruit of this move and of the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While it is respected by all those wishing to build a nuclear power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and clearing the way for them to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the overloading of the police, courts and administration subjected to a policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the 'country of human rights' status that France boasts of.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that became topical when the interior minister (see Libération of May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waitresses."
But until now, it has rarely been discussed from the point of view of economics.
It has to be said that there is a fairly broad consensus between left and right in this area.
Jacques Chirac set the tone on the right in 1976 when he declared that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with 2 million immigrant workers," and on the left, Michel Rocard said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of French territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we deign to give immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities when he states that joint development will make it possible to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem may be true in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recent work synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries.  which accept immigrants.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and hurts employment.
Concerns about the impact caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more of a complement than substitutes for French employees by performing jobs in sectors with underemployed staff.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants cause the arrival of immigrants to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would cause a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it ignores the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to thought-building and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems in European countries, amounting to an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany one migrant arriving at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenses) of €150,000 to public budgets over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed at the beginning of his mandate the wish to go "bared teeth" for the missing percentage of growth.
These teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought through
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, because despite having invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece during the XX century.
Some people may have believed that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible.
However, it is known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an "instrument of oppression," as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of departments and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as and from the beginning a crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the mistake of the Greek yes-no referendum will be worth a double revelation in this respect: revealing the need for a major return to political power, but also revealing a disturbing sense of its impossibility, of its impropriety.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic race have now shifted, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a series of national referendums organised on a necessari-by-necessity basis and in a disorganised manner.
A blank exposed to a European absolute monarch or a leap with your feet tied into the emptiness of nationalist depths: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - indeed, we would not even know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, that suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
There is an urgent need to restore governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, rid themselves of the rule of the markets, and prepare the future by investing.
Exit from the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After fighting for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly calling for a European economic government.
So.
But to think so without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
A revolution in interests could not be enough.
That lesson remains valid.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans in order to build Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Smart Card Fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phones with SIM cards) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay on public transport or make purchases just by bringing the card close to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total smart card market (6.925 million cards).
After long being dragged by the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But large chain stores work for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move into a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first stage to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is required for transactions.
"They are late."
"But their real expansion should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimate global sales of 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are already preparing ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a trial in Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhones of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay contactlessly with their mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long-standing suspicions that there are links between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerien sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even admitted that Algeria had "gained certainty" from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them," he explained, without elaborating.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the rubble after the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has been staying for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more convincing evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more evident in Boko Haram's development and manifestations or in its operational procedures, which now include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Fast success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in the Haoussa language, endorses the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Nigeria's Muslim north.
In this poor region, such a combination has a quick success.
The sect is politicizing itself and demanding strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its adherents are launching a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters become extremely active, multiplying their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's response is still the same.
The army surrounds the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
The sect's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group became radicalized and left its place of work in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he carries out an assassination in the city of Jos, in which 80 people die, then another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, now worries all security specialists.
Now that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has encircled Mali and the iger and Somalis of the Al-Shabaab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan Jonathan Juppé, Alain Juppé said that France was on alert and ready to "pass on all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues related to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by crisis, run the world with simple, or even simplistic, ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have been repeating loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point of Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or aid to Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the highest-ranking candidate in the race for the Republican Grand Old Party's nomination, threatened to summon the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and charge them "for manipulating their currency," a central issue in America exacerbated by the migration of entire parts of its industry toward Asia.
Even worse if this must involve triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly stuttered in an emotional stance.
It required a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who ranks last in the polls, remains unlistenable.
In the Image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to halt its nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran," he said fanfaronically.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to his partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranking candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a tough stance against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" – apparently ignorant of the fact that China has possessed a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They are all far from the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan had simple ideas, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine on the subject of the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus label him weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population judges the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq, he has had no confidence in military interventions that lead to a standstill.
And with arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking on a more appropriate place.
Nord Stream, a new port of Russian gas entry to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance gas pipeline, connecting directly Eastern Europe to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has become operational.
It must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea, last Tuesday.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte jointly turned the control wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow to Western Europe every year through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the state of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed by the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, an amount equivalent to the entire French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline of the gas pipeline on the same route is already being mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction has the character of a victory.
The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic countries.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without it being routed overland by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pressuring Russia by threatening to cut off its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
This was expressed most strongly by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
That is to say that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater certainty of its purchases.
But this is at the cost of weakening the energy Europe, because the project has created rifts between Europeans from the East and the West.
Barely 5 years ago, Russia managed to push through its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and wealthy, gas-consuming Western states whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," François Fillon confirmed at the pipeline's opening ceremony, demonstrating at what point big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical achievement.
The subsea pipeline is made of steel with a concrete shell to protect it from anchors of naval vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the time of the 2nd World War.
"For safety, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is never interrupted by valves or maintenance stations along its entire length.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but was rejected by project managers when the Swedes were less eager to see a Russian state-owned company permanently settling on their coast.
"In the event of a fault, we can stop the gas in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders, since the welds were designed so that a leak occurs once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is checked from the outside by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is checked by a device circulating inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the destination, after three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformation of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply provided by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains the leader, holding a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased to the company all its gas capacity for a five-year contract, which can be renewed.
"Gazprom will profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs thus rose to EUR 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be recouped, because only Gazprom is taking the risk.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, founded fifty years ago, wants to once again provide the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves of faded white color as if they had aged over time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes on the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation leather), which is used, for example, to treat the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back popularity to an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XXth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand's leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, settling at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from the secret production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to assemble any artificial portrait of the buyer, since the notebook will interest the businessman as well as the student or professionals.
Part of the image of the Moleskine notebook is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which in its beginnings had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and, through the FNAC chain of stores, to small boutiques in the city centers, where he has been able to assert his identity.
"We followed the zeitgeist and this need for new writing, despite the tumultuous development of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Treat", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new notebook plates resembling a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
Around 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today opens 15. A week for employing handicapped people.
Despite the voluntarist public policies introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled people is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Is it daunting?
"No," emphasizes Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, which organises Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not two, but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It should be noted that numerous obstacles remain for unemployed disabled people before they start work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that are 'at the heart of the problem', according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help businesses hire disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
What remains is unsaid, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that managers surveyed had a "poor level of knowledge about people with disabilities" with an exaggerated image of wheelchair users and psychological or mental deficiencies.
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still a long way from reaching the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures, from 2008, give a figure equal to 2.6%.
"We are now hovering around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organisation charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
This is evidenced by the number of "fined" companies as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 offending companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 law that increased contributions created strong pressure on businesses," Pierre Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labor, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before challenging the French internationals (Bleus) on Tuesday evening (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they will bring this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard simply and well reconciled.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, "it is one and the same, he justifies himself."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my brand."
Hazard, who was being investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, arrives at the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
The concept of "joy" cannot be overlooked.
To play against Bleus, whom he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily adds even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so because "opposite are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he says.
"We crossed ourselves immediately."
"To be able to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens also recalled "pride."
"Pride" to fight"match - holiday".
"Pride" also to note in the quality of the "neighbors" that France "has once again become a very high-level team a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he gushed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 in the direction of... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become big," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You'll realize that for the next matches." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts the play-off against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) with great optimism this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portugal national football team, at the helm since 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is one match left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had the upper hand for more than an hour, but they were unable to score such a rare goal to relieve them.
"It's a good result, but it carries a risk because we didn't score away goals."
But at home at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident that they will advance in front of an audience that should form a boiling cauldron, even if the match certainly seems "very even", says the optimist but keen Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the forty-two-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A tie may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a risk because we didn't score away goals," Bento regretted.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be keen to put maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, on condition that this time it turns out to be realistic.
