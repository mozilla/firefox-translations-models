What will he do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or a patisserie
The new city councillors from the ČSSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the assembly.
The daily "tested" Aktuálně.cz members of the new ČSSD council as they know the notorious slang that has arisen in the town hall during the last years when Prague was governed by the current coalition partners.
The coded vocabulary, which the Prague political elite introduced during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the capital.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what they claim.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am rather a novice in Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the councilor for culture, responded to the test of the "godfather" dictionary.
And although he is a political veteran, Councillor Karel Březina reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"It's the only term you give me that I use from time to time."
"Otherwise, I don't accept slang in general."
From the glossary, whose expressions the daily Aktuálně.cz published in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to a pastry shop", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "metal sheeting".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head Prague's education system in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test outright.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I won't evaluate how the Civic Democrats are talking."
"I'm now figuring out how we're going to understand each other within our programs," he said.
As has already been mentioned, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would reportedly not recognize in the headline above that we are talking about an influential businessman and friend of former mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" means nothing to Kaucký, and the only term he correctly guessed in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, and immediately adds: "But I know it more from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole as the Blanka tunnel is deciphered not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachý is also familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the expression "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague company," Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, he points out that he gained his knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a vocabulary.
In the Social Democrats, according to the test participants, there is no such well-established glossary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call each other by names, sometimes abbreviations and distortions of names are used," says the chairman of Prague's ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, nicknamed Hulda by party members.
"At school they called me Birch, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that too," Karel Březina admits to his own nickname.
The newspaper has tried Aktuálně.cz name and it works.
Councillor Weinert is Děda or less friendly Dědek for party members, councillor Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the election by fraudulent in sponsoring the party, has the nickname "Igráček" among some of his colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in internal party language.
Hulínský apparently does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Aktuálně.cz noted another nickname of the Prague chairman.
The "Doctor of Baton Law" is said to recall that Petr Hulínský received his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to curb torture of 'witches', brochure published
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several features in common.
They belong more to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
The one who "becomes" a witch is sent into isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer this fate."
"Even young, healthy women are not pushed back, because they help with work and give birth to children," says a nun who cares in a special house in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their ranks by their community.
The local government has now decided to crack down on the unusual "social measure".
It has published an information brochure to help curb witch-hunts.
But there is a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," Die Standard said of the disadvantage of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, seventy-two-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after being tortured, doused with kerosene and set on fire by three women and two men.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators claim it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman ignited the oil that is used for ritual anointing.
He said he caught fire after the group wanted to "cast out the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of their level of education.
Der Standard quoted a forty-two-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Devourers of human souls have always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, in Gambia the president himself took part in it as recently as last year.
"After the death of his aunt, President Jammi of Gambia launched a large-scale witch hunt for the witches who allegedly participated in her death and tried to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He enlisted the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguards, forcibly led randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a potion made from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bakala's tenant: He heats in the stove, he signed a higher rent
An older, stocky man stepped out the door of RPG Byty "uhlobarona" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a folder with new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
For all three, deregulation has just raised rents.
Instead of 3500 a month, my son will pay CZK 4100 for a 2+1 apartment of the second category from next year.
"And there is no hot water and petrama (solid fuel stoves, Editor's note) has to be heated," the man points his finger at his son's new contract, which he has power to sign.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which has described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7 to publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waves his hand at it.
"One says this, the other says that," he frowns.
The Ostrava region is becoming a great laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rents in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Right next to the door stands a security guard from a security agency and a summoning machine next to her.
"Lease 2011", a special button on its touch screen is lit.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You don't even have time to read "157" and your number is already beeping on the large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, it's your turn.
After a while, an elderly couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not concern the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new lease agreements in the Ostrava region have been delivered to mailboxes by tenants of most of the total of 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio since mid-November.
In letters, RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the Client Centre on 18 November.
"It's been going on for over a week, so it's just getting started," the workers behind the counter reply after a moment's hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' flats are a local hot-tempered topic.
Before the election, the deputy speaker of the parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek of the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) took it up quite loudly, and even now the local newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"Not even pos.. They didn't replace the plate in the toilet," the man mentioned in the introduction is relieved.
So far, according to the workers, pensioners are coming the most to see if they get a discount on rent if they sign on time, as RPG promises them in a special offer.
Other tenants who sign a new contract by December 15 will also receive a half discount on the February rent.
But the Havířov "deregulation" counter is certainly not overwhelmed with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here because of the rent for 2011," the workers behind the counter estimate.
RPGs on the web and on their bulletin boards propose individual negotiation of contracts where necessary.
However, if the lease is not agreed by both parties, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG warns on its website.
"No one will be judged here," thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty, and the man on the street in front of the client center partially agrees with her.
"I have a pension of 13,000 and I have five thousand left for food, I don't have what it takes to sue," he said.
But the worker immediately becomes uncertain.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he reflects.
Rent control ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not even reach the amount necessary for simple maintenance of the housing stock," says Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the neglect of the housing stock criticized by the angry tenant is, according to the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest four billion in rents, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, a large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats several red-highlighted information.
"The rent increase of 15% or less in 2011 affects 31,200 apartments, more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," he appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will see their rents rise by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is an increase from the extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," the RPG points out.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive up rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see the chart) will be put back into apartments, mainly into heat savings - new windows and insulation.
Priority should be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect it to hide a mini-kindergarten with everything that goes with it - with colourful walls, imaginative furniture, a stack of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
The design and architectural company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings have emerged, has been counting on space for its company mini-kindergarten since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people, mostly in the baby boom age, and she wanted women planners to get back to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of the social program.
Builders thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with child care.
The mini-kindergarten was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of the management they managed to get a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-kindergarten is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidies in the amount of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and ensure qualified personnel and operation for two years.
After the financial subsidy is exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design the company is obliged to run the mini-kindergarten at its own expense for a period of 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and Economy Rating significantly assisted with the grant application.
Care is provided by qualified staff, children are cared for all day by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, so children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a "mini-kindergarten", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day there are even more.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of status in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is comparable to the framework programme of pre-primary education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality education - from basic learning to preparation for school desks, English is also taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time and there are no stressful situations with delayed picking up of children from kindergartens far from the parents' workplace.
Thus, parents use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship is formed here.
Arch.Design has thus joined the ranks of Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and have strengthened personnel marketing through this program.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors by Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
Such is Casa Batlló in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The façade of the house plays dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
On close observation, one can see the geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the entire façade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of colors is even more intensified.
Winding and twisting shapes appear equally in interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, door trims, peepholes and moldings.
Located in the Eixample district on the busy Passeig de Grácia shopping street 43, Batlló was a 1877 conversion by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló apartment building was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
He was assisted by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaics on the façade were created.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the façade.
Working together on the Casa Batlló designs started Jujol and Gaudí's successful collaboration.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and the Park Güell, which houses other works by Gaudí.
Soon after its completion, the house earned the nickname "House of Bones" from the locals due to its organic shapes.
Others began to call it the "yawning house" because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows.
It is also said that on the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a central heating system unique for his time with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five degree inclination.
When creating it, Gaudí absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not let them bind him.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data he provided about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, during completion, the city council was horrified by the result and asked for a remedy.
The councillors were bothered, for example, by the fact that the construction interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
It was never remedied, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the call of the city district, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon, and on the third floor bedrooms and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is intersected by a staircase, which can be climbed to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors, and a larger company can communicate comfortably with each other without retaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house with Gaudí's reconstruction also received an unconventional roof and two extra floors.
Gaudí's play with light, blue and white glazed tiles lining the inner courtyard and skylights is also impressive.
The play of two colors gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark light, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and spectacular apartment open to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed with the tours because they found it to be a very convenient business and they also expanded the tours to include common and attic areas, including a roof terrace.
The entrance fee to the monument is certainly not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes have a twenty percent discount.
The sum is well above the price of admission to Gaudí's other buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you must quickly make friends with one of the inhabitants of the apartment building and visit him right at home.
How to choose a mattress and base: women have different requirements than men
Not the flashy bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface, i.e. the mattress and base, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must complement each other harmoniously to suit a particular user.
When choosing, a lot of things decide, from weight, height, age, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and base are purchased.
Archetype?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages, where there is no regular heating, because they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
In doing so, it is necessary to turn them over regularly.
If they do not have a lot of venting ducts in the core, and they are still lying on a solid plate, they retain moisture: mold could also appear under them.
Habit is also decisive in the selection.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel comfortable on a low and hard surface.
"Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they didn't sleep here."
"For their battered shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they poorly take 'information' from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers, were looking for mattresses with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's fine, suitable mattresses have for example Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL guy to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the heat absorbed, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, at night you will not roll over like after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing a mattress size, add the length of your foot to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both a man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, i.e. a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singlelists, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for bed width is simple: when lying on your back, you should keep your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Helena Prokopová, guildmaster of the Guild of Upholsterers and Decorators, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own base and mattress, but be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, you will have no choice but to mount the grates at different heights, but you may not be able to do this with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring frame at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the forming and baking layer.
"When touching your hands or touching the mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of base.
Fully upholstered beds, where the mattress and subfloor are like fused Siamese twins, have no place in bedrooms.
Mattresses are poorly ventilated, their cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) strainer.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about mattresses lifespan of up to 25 years, or even lifetime warranty.
However, everything has its buts.
And therefore practical advice from sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up hygiene and washing removable cover, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers with zippers around the entire circumference are commonly produced today, so that when unfastened we get two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), the handling of larger types (and with one person) could still resemble a fight between a light weight in the ring and a heavy one.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a grate?
Never!
A maximum of a bed intended for one night's visits.
However, still provide the board (if it does not already have them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (of it. Taschenfederkern) and baking layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a base.
For non-positioning slatted bases with 14 to 18 lamellas, latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable, but it is always worth slatting with a larger number of lamellas, 28 or more, where the slats in the loin area are doubled and their stiffness can be regulated.
Mattresses with a spring frame do not belong on positioning lamellar bases because they do not react to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the lamellae, which allows you to push or even tilt the lamella so that the sleeper's arm is nicely "sinked".
For men who have "shoulders over the whole back", definitely an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers remember it, who in the "men's" began to use a softening zone just in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface in the hip spots.
For the most demanding customers there are aileron or plate grates with so-called multitorsional suspension.
The pressure spreads to multiple points and the voltage decreases.
But beware, as soon as you use the wrong pillow (large and "puffy") on the right mattress and base, most of the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips reach only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on its side, the pillow should balance (along with the shoulder cradle of the base or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original grass-filled straw mattresses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is simply organic for mattresses.
Raw materials from crude oil, from which polyurethane foams are made, are being replaced by natural oils, for example, from castor and soy.
Soybeans are used by almost all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio mattresses mean that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men are "cooled" by birch plant extract so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women, on the contrary, "heats" the covers for women.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it warmer to the weaker sex.
Today's favourites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with broken cellular structure, so it is more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of different stiffness of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, loins and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters, tend to have a lower VAT rate, are considered as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage.
Saving on a mattress and base is not easy.
Sometimes you can use the actions of manufacturers or retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam sewn into the cover for CZK 11,990.
However, the second one can be purchased for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cellular structure and high density was started at a "cosmic" pace by Temdur.
It was originally created as material for NASA because astronauts were subjected to enormous overload during launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, on the contrary, it hardens in the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against bedsores, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the legs, which relieve the legs and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want people tracking devices, so they want to watch their children
Fear for their own child leads more and more people to the idea of GPS babysitting.
A system originally created for searching for cars can also track the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is still about the size of a matchbox, but soon it may only be as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy happening," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I concede that in some cases such devices may be misused, for example when they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet come across such a case."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" serves and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in losing things on purpose when they don't want to be in control."
"Parents used to have great expectations of mobile phones, but they can be turned off just like these tracking devices," Bočková says.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to a planned abduction, the perpetrator almost always makes sure that the child does not have any electronics with him that could reveal his location."
"It's a phone now."
"When tracking devices start to proliferate, they will look for them as well, because their sales will surely be supported by massive advertising."
"In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in the event of a sudden paedophile attack.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the surveillance device is immediately destroyed after an attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to periodically send a location after a certain period of time."
"Should it be damaged, at least the last location of the person concerned will be available."
"More expensive devices also have built-in tiltmeters, so even if a person just slips and remains motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with a position," says Čech.
According to him, a similar service can be performed by smartphones with navigation, where you just need to upload special software.
The problem with current surveillance units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of their loss.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"This will have the biggest advantage that the potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he only recognizes them after some time, and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether tracking devices evolve into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used for guarding cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (used by conventional car navigation) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would encircle the Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years
The Czech Army bought 445 km of lines that detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometres of lines to the warehouses.
The army thus has 225 years of reserves.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two, maximum four years.
The army bought the detonating cords from STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
The General Staff, justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of detonating cords, wrote back to MF DNES that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of fuses a year during training.
However, the calculations of army pyrotechnics contacted by MF DNES show that then all generals, army command officers, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defence Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick included.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of an army of sixty kilometers of fuses.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army's reserves would last for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, it were true that a maximum of two meters of detonating cord is enough for the basic training of each new professional, as experts say, then the army has secured with a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of engineer or special forces - supplies for the aforementioned 225 years.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for small arms, so even shooting is limited due to lack of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It also bothers me that they buy such a large number of fuses from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision and they certainly know what they're going to do."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to satisfy," says Jan Děcký, Sales Manager of STV Group.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pejšek also justifies the hundreds of kilometers of purchased cord by the fact that the army will have stocks of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from STV Group speaks only of a four-year lifetime of a fuse, and police or army pyrotechnics even only two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four of them," says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to be named because of criticism of the military.
At the end of its service life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the ministry is a quantity discount on 445 kilometers of detonating cords.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's two-hundred-and-forty-four-kilometre delivery," says spokesman Pejšek, interpreting the position of the Ministry of Defence buyers.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnicians who dispose of ammunition from the Second World War or the one left by the Soviet army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order just enough to use up the ammunition before the end of its useful life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and it can also obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords more flexibly.
The Ministry of Defence already has considerable difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the two-hundred-thousand-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians contacted by MF DNES, the Czech one will face the same problem in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses that it now buys "cheaply".
To this day, I draw on the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in selling the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's Entrepreneur of the Year competition was twenty-eight-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like something out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
With savings from foreign brigades and a bank loan, he bought a half-ruined house with five apartments.
For the fact that he was still a third-year university student at the time, it was a great courage.
"The ratio between quality and price of accommodation in our country at that time did not give me the opportunity not to try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the first renovated apartment to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another one of the same quality was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we have sold our franchise concept and other people interested in franchising the Pytloun hotels are applying," says last year's number one entrepreneur.
"And this sale of the hotel operating licence was largely due to winning the Entrepreneur of the Year competition," adds Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater recognition and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me afterwards and I have to say it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to everyone who is trying to do something.
It is not even necessary to win, every visibility is good.
He says that to this day he draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have gotten to otherwise.
"I started trading with some of them through the competition."
According to him, the fame associated with success fell on every employee.
And that he has about seventy of them.
"I see more loyalty and pride in them for being involved in something that has gained widespread recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of good work by all of us together."
"Only my name is pushed to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the single-mindedness of the winner, however, Farmet has worse times behind him.
The prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition went to the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, at Slovanský dům last year.
The jury appreciated the effort through which he built a company with hundreds of millions in turnover from a small toolmaking workshop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and increased our confidence to compete against the competition," says last year's winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karel Žďárský's father a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father founded a plastic bathtub company.
Not long after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the non-professional public after its success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in its country," says Karel Žďárský.
However, the past year in Farmet was not only marked by the euphoria of victory.
The valuation was based on the company's financial results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis was at its peak, which had not yet affected citizens so much, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and began to limit purchases of new machinery and technologies.
"Of course, this situation has not escaped us either."
"Sales dropped by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were also layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
However, they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, albeit less than before the crisis.
However, what Farmet has not compromised on is investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre from subsidies, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs, won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and so are the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
Poll that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the office that are also accessible to officials online.
It was decided by more than a third of the less than four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can obtain it with two clicks of a mouse.
Thanks to the poll, that will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during inspections of insurance payers," ČSSA spokeswoman Jana Buraňová said.
Shining a light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with and abolishing the nonsensical ones is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of a business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny and is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If last year about three thousand voters took part in the voting, this year there were almost four thousand.
And no wonder, there are still plenty of various legal obligations that serve only to delay business.
"For example, in the number of tax return papers, we are at the forefront of the world," says Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, simplifying business has become a stated goal of all governments.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not much improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and runs annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can submit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition deadline is closed.
To log in, use the web address www.firmaroku.cz Then the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote for it over the Internet on the www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz websites during October.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's survey was entered by more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations that are meaningless.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition were, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of motorways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven designs is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, assisted at this culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state puts obstacles in the way of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to abolish at least thirty paragraphs every year that only unnecessarily complicate business today," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to repeal nonsensical regulations are not in vain.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days in advance to the Trade Licensing Office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a business trip of up to 30 days on behalf of its foreign employee, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And all good things come in threes.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two step-on scales in their office.
This year was mitigated by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator was dropped.
New category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the Hospodářské noviny competitions is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"In this way, we want to support companies that take into account the environmental impacts of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as in the case of the competition for Rebel of the Year.
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 competition was entered by companies for whom business success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would make for a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities is diametrically opposed to each other, the common denominators of their efforts can be considered support and consideration.
In one case, for example, it concerns disabled people, and in another, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen nationwide finalists was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
On the other hand, the paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of them, takes care of its disabled employees, which is why it won the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and ranked third in the region in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
The winner in the Olomouc region was the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for preferentially buying from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem Region thinks about the health of its employees and has bought ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Romani community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Washing and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to its employees' supplementary pension insurance in the form of above-standard bonuses.
"In our country, we give contributions to food, transport, improving qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category, answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"It is not possible to register separately for this competition alone, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police made arrests during a public tender
In recent days, the anti-corruption police have been arresting the Land Fund building in Pilsen.
The detectives put the handcuffs on a local entrepreneur in the media sphere and real estate trader Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public tender to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a specific bidder.
He was supposed to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offense of scheming in a public contract and in a public tender," the head of the Pilsen State Prosecutor's Office, Antonie Zelena, told Pravo, adding that further details cannot be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
The forty-six-year-old businessman was released by the police after 24 hours.
Given the minimum of official information, it is only possible to speculate about how he could have influenced the tender.
Lubomír Černá, a spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said in response to a question from Právo that police officers had actually made arrests at the remote workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to Černá, the public tender has the correct name "Call for Bid for Land Transfer Claims under the Land Act" and is held when more eligible applicants are interested in the offered land.
"These persons are offering a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," a spokeswoman for the fund explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who had signed up for the call, and because he himself is also an authorized person, as he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the land applicant that he would not participate in the competition.
For this, he probably collected severance pay.
That would explain why he had such a large sum of money when he was detained.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He figured in the case of the former head of the PF, Václav Sankoto, who was prosecuted for handing over land in substitute restitution on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was at that time that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he exchanged them very advantageously with the municipality for a house in the historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to accept this, because otherwise it would have endangered the construction by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds a month for housing
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heat supplies and rents will rise in some places.
From January, families will have to pull up to hundreds of crowns more per month from their wallets than now.
Electricity will become more expensive by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, you will have to pay more for water supplies in some cities by up to a tenth, and central heat supplies will also become more expensive in many places.
The increase in the price of electricity should cost households in apartments hundreds of crowns more expensive annually than now.
At the same time, the prices of electricity have been reduced by all major suppliers, which is due to a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
Gas will become slightly more expensive, but at a time when people heat the most and thus have the highest consumption.
Every year, they also have to count on hundreds of extra crowns.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive across the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about CZK 50 extra per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than CZK 1,000 a year for central heating.
Residents of Prague are at risk of more than 9 percent more expensive water and sewerage rates if the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Roaster will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the nationwide comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage rates should rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation ends in January, may rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new rent will be taken to court by the company.
Regulated rents, which people pay in about 300,000 apartments, could rise by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks after which drunkards who are not even fifteen years old end up in the care of doctors.
An exception are not children who are treated from monkeys in the hospital repeatedly.
This is based on the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the receptions of children's wards of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk on them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head physician of the children's department of Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Právo.
"If they manage to pull a bottle out of Dad's closet, it's whiskey, but otherwise fernet and vodka predominate."
"Vodka has the advantage that they pour it into the juice and it is not so much to smell of," explained the head physician.
Eva Jurinová, spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, agrees with him.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"That's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was plum brandy that they had brought from home," Jurin said.
According to Dr. Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are a relatively common phenomenon in hospital admission.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years at the paediatrics in Motol, where ambulances transport schoolchildren from far and wide.
"One girl has been lying with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"Interestingly, her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the head doctor wondered.
It is the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of the growing drinking of children.
However, according to experts, addiction in the true sense of the word cannot be spoken of in children.
"The term alcoholic means several years of chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that go with it, and this is not the case in children."
"Those who use alcohol repeatedly tend to have a bad family-social background," explained Dr. Pelikán.
According to Jurinová's spokeswoman, about forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital get into the statistics.
Child drunks who are taken away by their parents after outpatient treatment or brought home by the police are not counted.
Apart from cases when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They're either drinking the grief of a bad report card or, on the contrary, celebrating the start of the holidays."
"However, for witches, I have experienced seven child drunks at the reception at once," Pelikán said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over one who suffers an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are relieved by irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They are actually better off because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts them."
"They are just confused about where they are," admitted Pelikán, adding that he sometimes spoils the pleasant mood of patients by at least listing the costs that their treatment has involvement.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization in an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I then calculated directly to the children on the business card how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on a temporary job to earn money for that one party," Pelikán added.
However, health insurance companies do not resort to regression proceedings in which they would recover the costs of treatment from parents in cases of child drunks, he said.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five aircraft, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type appeared in the ownership of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad on exercises or demonstration flights.
These are two-seat versions of the L-159T1, which had so far been operated by the Czech Army and which were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody and the intermediary of the business - Omnipol - took them over last week.
When the planes will physically dispatch from Vodochody is not yet known, according to Jan Pejšek from the press department of defense.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for exchange were separated from long-term stored aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the ministry."
"Two-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in their current condition and form," Pejšek told Pravo.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater aircraft, because in May 2009 the ministry signed a contract worth 200 million crowns with Aero Vodochody for the conversion of four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the second will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to putting the aircraft into service with some alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and they will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the customer how to implement this thing," Pejšek said.
Hospodářské noviny recently reported that the Spanish army, for example, is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion were approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not announce a tender for the purchase and approached EADS directly.
The then defense leadership argued that the exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest it would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court because it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three CASA aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than their ring finger are less likely to develop prostate cancer.
That's the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick's Institute for Cancer Research.
The finger could help determine which men should get tested for prostate cancer, especially when combined with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients in Britain and over three thousand healthy men in parallel.
More than half of the study participants had an index finger on their right hand shorter than their ring finger.
They were just as likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, for those who had an index finger longer than the ring finger, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men under sixty, the drop was 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone promotes growing prostate cancer.
Professor Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences, told the Czech News Agency that he has a cursory knowledge of the study, but that the relationship between finger length and cancer has not been "completely proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pavements lies mostly driven snow, road workers in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents involving trucks and cars, and the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague is also closed.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed at kilometer 91, two trucks collided at kilometer 93, causing injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should go down just outside Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then drive at the 182nd kilometer at Kývalka.
There are queues of several kilometers.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of several centimeters of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are formed, for example, in Prosek, Štěrboholská is also congested.
The surest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run with delays, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, the Prague Crisis Management Group is to meet again.
Railways and airports are also struggling.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express trains due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. until five in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
In the Vyškov region, three secondary roads are impassable, in the Brno region, snow tongues form in places, and in the Blansko region, snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in higher places.
One of the most affected places was the Vyškov region.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To stretch them will need to put cutters.
When they will be cleared cannot yet be estimated.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained there only by inert grit due to nature protection, there is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, the Czech News Agency reported.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of snow fell, most of it fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
About 15 centimetres of snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually stopping.
U.S. Soldiers Have a New 'Smart Weapon'
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new automatic rifle will influence the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a small super-accurate gun.
Its projectiles guide the laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm cartridges developed for this rifle and containing a high-explosive explosive actually function as small grenades.
Cartridges can be programmed to explode not only on impact with a target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It's usually not protected from above, and when a murderous rain of steel shrapnel falls on it, it can put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"Basically, the soldier handles it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to determine the distance, thus obtaining a specified aiming point, adjusting the elevation accordingly and pressing the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun reloads and fires the shot at a range of 543 meters, plus or minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The 400 employees will move their workplace from the current administration building on Marienbader-Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The computer and computer maintenance giant said on Wednesday that 400 men and women will move their jobs from their current office building on Marienbader-Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyon Street, in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt, in July next year.
According to a Fujist spokeswoman, another 100 of the Group's jobs, which are still distributed in the region, should be relocated there in the near future.
The lease offer was said to be very attractive and the open-plan offices in Astro Park were said to be more suited to the employees' working style.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Competent managing director Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure".
Excellent connections to the airport are very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important business within the region yesterday caused joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), a senior economic officer in Frankfurt, said it had succeeded in attracting a "global player".
It is a "fantastic sign of confidence in the location".
Fujitsu is said to fit the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was reportedly informed by the company's management of his intention in time.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the landlord of the property on Marienbader-Square.
In the end, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is a matter of avoiding a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the house on the Rathaus Square, which had been used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale", along with the other buildings on Marienbader-Square, were among the most discussed building projects in the spa town.
Between the station and the town hall, the so-called urban entree was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer, which was criticized both for the massive development of areas that previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment advisory and rating company Feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006, and sold a year later to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, a Tokyo-based concern, describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers companies computers and servers at its disposal and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine-Main site is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujitsu's employees are in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park office building, 7,000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
The complex - its name draws attention to the star-shaped ground plan, which is twenty years old, houses the Central Union of Electrical and Electronic Industries, among others.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon's internet service has shut down its detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was done under political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly in the UK.
Wikileaks, the disclosure platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed on Interpol's wanted list, is said to be staying in the UK, according to a newspaper article.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the land of the free," activists posted via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had downloaded the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic cables to handle the high number of document accesses.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: "Okay – we're going to spend our dollars now employing people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with free speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon has halted the use of its servers for Wikileaks after associates of Senator Joe Lieberman allegedly conducted a search, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this step sooner, given the earlier disclosures of classified information by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, blatantly and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet," the non-partisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible firm — whether U.S. or foreign — should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, and Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there had been threats.
"There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently reacting to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for posting on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, said on television - perhaps ironically, Assange should be "assassinated" and Obama could use a "target plane".
Meanwhile, a verbal skirmish broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently published spying appeals to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively examining the security of its databases.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures, has been appointed as special envoy, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" that are needed after the publication of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are in danger because of their exposure on Wikileaks.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice Cream University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
There is great interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a little outdated ice-cream maker, makes cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooler with a spatula, wipes it into a wafer and sells it.
You don't need to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna to find out.
But if you want to learn even more about ice cream, you will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, an ice cream machine manufacturer established an ice cream university so that the ice cream from its machines would correspond to high Italian ideals everywhere.
There is a huge interest in the basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some long for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
During his training, Luciano will remember the southern and patriotic icing on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a good dose of romance."
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the tap on the machine and a pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream, comes out.
Immediately, the associate professor is bombarded with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" probably used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer eats all the ice grains.
Certain variations of the basic mass are permitted.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are powders and creams.
"Suppliers will try to force a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream made of white base material, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa as the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the participants of the course are allowed to go to the ice cream machines.
Luciano always makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base material, with more or less vanilla flavors or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - given the taste, it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced blend properly highlights the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (winemakers measure the must from grapes).
Fortunately, tables make counting easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the machine for the automatic production of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into a cream and cools to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, small accidents are inevitable.
Brazilian Gustavo soils himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In any course," believes Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in double light
EFSA is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
The accusation has now been made by a group of experts at Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of EFSA's expert group on gene-engineered plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert, have been under contract with the lobbyists' union Ilsi for several years.
It is financed by concerns such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in EFSA's control regulations for genetic plants and thus has a clear conflict of interest, Then.
Efsa's regulations are said to be identical in paragraphs to the Ilsi documents, bearing the hallmark of an industry that should be inspected by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has raised a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa switched to the Swiss agrarian concern Syngenta without any amendments or temporary periods - and thus switched parties.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) also recently revealed a personal link between the EU-Control Authority and the industrial lobby, which has attracted the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MEPs.
In the meantime, EFSA cannot identify conflicts of interest.
We work with all serious data, including those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required not to have contacts with industry.
But they have to prove them.
Kuiper admits to his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, for assessing the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that gene-engineered plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what gene-altered corn in the field will do, for example," says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
"If risks are not sought, how can they be found?" asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching gentechnics since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected with concerns.
Most of the time, studies that are critical to companies are not published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Footprint of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, he stood outside the train station in Stuttgart, tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
Snowed.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began tearing down a large part of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, the billion-dollar reduction of the railway station.
When the construction stopped was reached, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"It must not disappear."
He gushes: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and primeval."
When he cut one, it smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he will do with these pieces, he does not yet know.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former ammunition dump of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappear into a depot," he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a watchhouse.
He says he was abused and threatened when in September all the newspapers said that he had bought the remains of the north wing from a demolition company.
But he talked for days with S-21 opponents.
And he explained that the demolition was not his fault at all.
And when this happens, then it is most sensible if the stones are further used.
Then took about 200 S-21-opponents each about one about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memento, some also in the hope that they will return it when rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from all corners and towed what they could fit in the trunk and trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long since turned into "walls" or as edges of herb beds.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political parenthesis."
He gets into his off-road car and goes for a ride around his 20-hectare kingdom.
He first studied law, interrupted his studies, then biology, then became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And a lover of stones.
It has stored 40,000 tons of stones.
He brings his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest dealer of old stones in the country.
Inhibit.
In the snow lie artistically carved sandstones.
"Once they belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden," he says.
Sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My favorite stone."
We continue along the road up through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once the blocks belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertine from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how rocks used to be broken by hand and transported using simple hoists and bull carts, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like that were crushed."
He didn't get rich, certainly not very rich.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the leftovers.
In the near future he has to go to Cologne.
Stones will also be saved there.
Talent Battle for High-Potentials
There are a lot of people at the snack bars.
16 students crowd over salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen in passing.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest minds, just like VW, and rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: to recruit the most talented graduates in lecture halls as soon as possible, before they enter the labor market and others are interested in them.
Since universities do not publish lists of their students' achievements, companies try to identify and attract exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive concern is trying to attract talent the next day.
A young lady from the human resources department hands out pens, gummy bears and VW logo plates.
He tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs and suggests them routes to the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is in charge of the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be a good fit as a collaborator."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
What is new, however, is that there is such an open fight for students.
"Otherwise, it was more of a substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is likely to be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer select their employees from long lines of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract a particularly highly qualified workforce.
Especially graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the VDI Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
It organizes challenging recruiting events, such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students around the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème, out of many applicants, will fly to the USA.
In the race for High Potentials at universities, according to Dykta, increasingly tough laws will apply.
"We want to stand out with our Race."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
It seems that the talent hunter Dykta is lucky.
"We have stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year."
"Some will be finishing their studies soon and planning to apply for jobs with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular present themselves classically on the labor markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"Like Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, HR manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe is familiar with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are listed on the company's website.
"It's difficult at the moment to fill vacancies."
"It takes a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to do a practical or write a thesis with us."
The solar specialist does not organize any expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to attract with other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Large corporations often cannot offer this," says the head of the human resources department at Stübe.
In the search for a job, money has not played a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good advancement opportunities are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the HR department, Stübe, hopes that the placement will earn her points with job seekers.
"I think candidates are particularly interested in external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees," he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the promotion of the employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with string," Kriegler says.
Obama Halts New Oil Drilling
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be drilled off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus definitively canceled earlier plans.
New drilling is also banned off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To date, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The center of criticism is the British energy concern BP, which is confronted with billion-dollar claims.
An investigative commission mandated by Obama is expected to present the results in December.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil concerns submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with tighter controls and strict safety regulations.
At present, the Audit Office is fundamentally reformed, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will drastically reduce the volume of oil produced in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest drag on the growth of the gas and oil industries," reads the result of a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO — ahead of a drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what regulation will change."
Investments in new mining projects are postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of spilled oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People make their living by stealing, corrupting and illegally boiling oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," an environmental activist reassures journalists: "You'll still get a lot of oil mud in front of your lens today."
A 37-year-old Nigerian man watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading chest through water surrounded by smudges: the scene looks almost pretty in the watery sheen with rainbow colors.
That brown oil clots float beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect enough shrimps in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow-flowing water has become completely dead.
Five years ago, large amounts of oil spilled into a huge, balmy area from a broken power line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni region, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst polluted areas in the world.
Traveling down the river through mangrove swamps with many side tributaries, the full extent of the trigger is only noticeable.
The engine on the boat boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out his oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black sticks of licorice, rarely occurring palm trees leave their leaves hanging sadly.
We search in vain for flocks of birds that are commonly found in humid areas: as soon as the engine on the boat dies down, a haunting silence descends in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump.
"What is happening here is the ecological waging of war," says Celestine Akpobari sadly: "We live in constant fear for our health."
The comparison with war is justified.
The area of the Ogoni settlement is a battlefield where fighting has been going on for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe flocked here, here in the 80s the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell concern had to stop its production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for the employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire delta region of Switzerland's triple size with more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of lines with more than two million barrels of black gold is mined daily, the oil fields in the Ogoni area lie fallow, the situation is too unstable for the concern.
Every few hundred meters, steel structures rise from the water like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so they are all too tenderly called drill hole heads.
They are 50 years old, most rusted to the core.
Every now and then such a drill hole head breaks, Akpobari relates, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion liters have flowed into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that spilled into the sea off Alaska in the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There is controversy as to who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists cite bursting well heads and leaking lines as the main cause.
Shell requires far less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: Only the number of faults on the lines is "several times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-stained open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to their necks from oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by wiring, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline flows from the line into the catch pot, later kerosene drips at the end of the line and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: "We earn 34,000 Naira" - about $ 22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in Black Africa's largest oil state.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents of euro per litre of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who connect to power lines everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost every day in the entire Niger Delta region.
But only a negligibly small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the largest share is filled into tankers by organized criminal networks, which are supposed to include politicians and high-ranking military officials, and sold on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or by the lax method of production is considered by activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies had not considered themselves intruders and had not so completely destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, then there would have been no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, Ogoni's relationship with Shell in particular is so damaged that only a departure of the concern is possible: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will prove to be better."
Michael is uneasy.
"High time you disappeared," says the muscular manufacturer.
"Soldiers can come at any moment."
If a special military unit finds them, they do not face jail, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has brought our country to the bottom in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators Discover Dangerous Construction Flaw in A380 Engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety flaw.
During an inspection of the plane that made an emergency landing, investigators found a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers may have had more luck than previously known in an emergency landing in early November: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority, in its investigations, found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
A possible failure would have severe consequences: one oil joint could crack due to wear, ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is a Qantas Airbus that had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed grounds for the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts came loose and damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce blamed burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines worldwide have to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with the giant planes that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security flaw was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of one A380 as a safety measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall will cause traffic chaos
Germany dressed in white: it snowed overnight almost the whole country.
Many roads are chaotic, trains and planes are jammed.
At least three people have died in road accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire country has sunk into snow overnight on Thursday in freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, up to 15 centimeters of snow lies in some places.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, road service was still in operation, but could not cope with the newly winded snow.
In addition, there were strong gusty winds over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office of Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a stormy torrent on the Baltic coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning, with water levels 1.2 metres above normal.
Snow drifts have caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads in Saxony.
According to the Meteomedia bad weather headquarters in Saxon Switzerland, the alarm level was purple – the highest level ever.
Some of it was 30 centimetres of new snow, and strong and fresh winds caused snowdrifts.
Several trucks and passenger cars stayed there during the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major difficulties on the roads.
On the A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia there were difficulties due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there is a lot of trouble in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken overhead lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, he had to stop an ICE for Munich.
165 passengers received woolen blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers on the train.
A snow wind blew across the roads.
Many flights at major German airports were cancelled due to snow winds.
According to a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Centre, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt nach Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
Road maintenance is in constant action.
Although only a few passengers remained at the airport without connections, there are 400 field beds prepared for them.
There were already accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a level crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: here, too, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder and will therefore rise even with light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only on the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds of gale force.
But it will be very cold - locally to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for the twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper article, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at the headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could raise up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its Group headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; In the meantime, bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group apparently wants the renovation costs back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as reported by the "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it makes more sense to own or sell the properties and then rent them out again," he said.
With this, the largest credit institution in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for €272 million from investors in its own fund and subsequently renovated them at great cost.
According to the data, the energy conversion swallowed up about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to a newspaper article, industry experts estimate the value of the towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
A spokesman said it was undecided whether the building would be sold again to a fund or an independent investor.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people paid tribute to buried miners in New Zealand, who were pronounced dead after several explosions at the mine.
It has still not been possible to rescue the dead because the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety.
After the second powerful detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners had no chance of survival.
It has still not been possible to free the dead.
Now relatives and friends have honored the memory of the dead.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
To commemorate the buried miners, 29 tables were built, on them helmets, lanterns and the names of the miners.
Pictures and personal belongings such as clothes and surfboards also found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped that miners would once again come to the surface from the "depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
British and South African miners were also overwhelmed during the explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases dissolve, the high temperatures inside the mine begin to cool, Police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is horror suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn attempts to revisit old boundaries with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in large numbers with almost supernatural force - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, as our hero helps himself with cruel killing methods and rips even the guts out of his enemies' bellies alive when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as he is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters utter at most a sentence or two or let themselves be drawn into distressing dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and reveled in the horrifically beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of Vikings some thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts interested in existentialism and very calm camera shots.
It's good when a film has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists bringing his works either more humorous to the mainstream or less brutality to an artistic audience.
Most fans of art cinema seem to be put off by the splashing of brains and guts everywhere.
Action movie fans get bored at the latest when One-Eyed sets off by boat for a group of violent Christian missionaries to Jerusalem for loosely explained reasons, hanging in the calm and fog for eternity before the men apparently reach America and remain silent.
No wonder "Walhalla Rising" did not make it to theaters in Germany and has now been released only on DVD.
It's a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive façade, sometimes even bloodstained, hides an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogues or the exact plot, everything is an atmosphere, a fevered dream that has become a film.
And there is no escape from this for the viewer.
Refn doesn't give him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his chilling shots and grim hypnotic soundtrack, but above all the indescribable hatred that gushes from the hearts of the characters.
Only the little blond boy who helps One-Eyed retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, who in time becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It portrays destruction, but perhaps also only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new alerts about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country resists the statement - and does not allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Deir as-Saur.
In documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), its name appears when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that branches off the current.
Based on a US-US foreign intelligence agency CIA statement in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
Technology from the fifties is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with out-of-focus satellite images.
Using computer animation, she clarified where the reactor components might have been before the destruction, a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, photographs were submitted that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before start-up, but still without fuel elements.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than then, and the puzzles have even gotten bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor at el-Kibar, but basically had no basis that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence correspondents in Europe are even more cautious, referring only to an "alleged reactor," even though they consider the CIA's presentation "credible."
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked last summer how confident he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The rubble of the supposedly "disused military building" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and the terrain was properly leveled.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received, through a member state, satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the period immediately after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market, because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - maybe Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program and has not built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite images.
In addition, he forbade inspectors a second inspection of el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, is stubbornly silent.
"We will never comment on this," Ehud Olmert, the ruling prime minister at the time, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation into the case has dragged on fruitlessly since June 2008 and is "growing into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the office," as a senior Western diplomat admitted at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna - a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA sees three other facilities as key to moving forward with the alleged reactor — and unlike it, they still exist.
The inspectors have not yet said which devices they are, what their function is or why they are suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA refers to them internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these objects and found a complex of buildings in satellite images that is believed to be one of the suspicious objects.
It is apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason Syria refuses IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians are afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite images that material was transported back and forth between these three sites and the square at Euphrates.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said at least one facility should be "related to fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are required for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from, and where it would later split off plutonium into a bomb, there are only probable estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris, which could hide important clues, are hidden in these three locations.
As if hundreds of loads of trucks have disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to have any information where the rubble went.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphrates lies the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it did not help to clear up suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for inspectors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors are.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected this proposal as well.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the thing was not burning, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the harshest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce inspections.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am leaning towards in the future", but has so far hesitated.
This choice carries a big risk: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they end up finding nothing?"
Love in Time of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie began work on her still-untitled directorial debut in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the screenplay herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Not much more is known yet - but even that causes unrest.
There is constant talk that the woman, who is a Muslim, will fall in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's groups immediately protested, so the planned filming was hastily moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote through UNHCR refugee aid organization Jolie and asked to meet the actress, Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is also an ambassador for the UN-organization to help refugees.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered to meet the women weeks ago in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims says a lot about the script.
Her organization recommended that the UN-Refugee Aid Organization release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given the script to read, allowed filming after a little wrangling in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author emphasizes that she does not pursue any political intentions in her film, that she devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Given the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film circulating on the internet that sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war began, and they meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged to a Serbian camp where he serves as a security guard.
Which really sounds quite different from "a rape victim falls in love with his tormentor."
The fact that Jolie really starts before the war is true.
Jolie says there's pressure on her that "isn't fair and is based on erroneous information."
Now they can free her from Hollywood: By illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
Once again, this evening is good for the Irish.
No trace of grief.
The home team dominates significantly over their guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy to the sound of loud music, stamping their feet.
Bailey-Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is in turmoil as players throw tennis balls three metres away into beer cups – and hit the mark.
"Beer Pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a prize money, plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Beer Pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; This screaming beer game and the restrained IT specialist don't go well together.
Still, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, to relax from the pressing question of what the future holds.
His plan is not a passion for playing in Las Vegas, he is going to New Zealand for an interview in January.
"It feels so weird," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have work there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe that's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of the three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it seems to be the case with many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict experts at ESRI, a scientific institute for economic and social affairs in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country of only 4.5 million people, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a wave of emigration similar to that suffered in Ireland in the eighties.
After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to the Irish, dismalness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling young, educated Irish, who have so far experienced only a boom.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in those boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was wasted.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are out of work.
There are many letters from readers in the Irish Times who complain: 'Everything is going downhill in Ireland'.
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but those who can, go away and our country loses a generation."
"Let the last one go out, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees the future in a dark light, saying the government is only deceiving and offering young people no future prospects.
"They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates weave from one unpaid practitioner to the next.
Her biggest fear is that she will have to move out alone in four years.
"The thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon is organizing "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take their first steps up the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website there are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year what it's like to build something somewhere else.
As the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
He is currently building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off a home loan at home.
"Sometimes the situation is really a bit crazy," he says as he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in at all."
He laughs sheepishly and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, large expensive cars are parked at the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for €380,000 – 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that it might not end well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, sipping his hot tea, and says, "I don't have children to feed, and I'm young; Even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
A civil engineer doesn't like the whining he hears so often now.
"No one has to go hungry – our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen – maybe then we will feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait to see how life develops elsewhere.
He's also had a few years of work in London, and why shouldn't it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might turn into a farewell party.
"No emotion," he says, taking a good sip of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a passing celebration, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime is a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered more influential by many regions than the United States.
These are some of the results of the latest Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
As the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can track changes in attitudes across the region.
This year's survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several Pacific countries in South America (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy was recovering after a deep decline in output last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are staunch Democrats, dragging down the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but a large increase compared to 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they trust the parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same figures as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, an economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support was created during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% that year.)
However, the mood changes across a wide range from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime worsened.
For only the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say either they or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but that's down from 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in growing support for private entrepreneurship and the market economy: some 71% of respondents across the region say that private entrepreneurship is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of the same opinion (and 80% support private entrepreneurship there), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, up from 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were far worse than the outsiders who are trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections meant filling ballots and repeated voting, ballots scattered across the sewers, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced because of the January earthquake, wandered around trying to figure out where they could vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed presumed runners, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways it was a pretty good election."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are beholden to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected showdown is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have backed down from their initial call for the vote to be annulled.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is labelled by the electoral commission for having won a runoff.
With the cholera epidemic raging and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, voter turnout was feared to be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
The roughly 250,000 ID cards required to vote remained undistributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
Tiptoe to the center
In the weeks she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, has benefited from public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20% to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning that success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on a grieving Ms Fernández giving up the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And everything will be based on these signs.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued his economic policy after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized when Mr Kirchner died of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to next year, with the president having more room to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: growth of up to 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speak of a figure that is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was suffering from economic collapse, has prioritised growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and purged INDEC, the statistical agency that had agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private businesses and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on the great devaluation of 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is making it clear that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck up an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure a debt Argentina defaulted on in 2001.
Now President Fernández is facing an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes some $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted on keeping this fact in sight of the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index that would resemble an introduction to INDEC cleanup.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term of office, when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of a middle class tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will wane.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce many of her husband's views in politics.
Half a boost for China
Taiwan's voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those entitled, voted for mayors and city councils in five districts on November 27, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself represents the feelings that prevail towards the mainland and have a strong foothold in business relations, including a semi-free trade agreement, the largest normalisation of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favor of greater Taiwan independence, won nearly 50% of the total vote against 45% of the KMT.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was together with the KMT in city councils.
The election played out like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags with scantily clad girls.
It even included the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was canvassing for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly across the face, wounding him and killing a spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, candidates struggled over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiments.
It is a reaction to the fact and realization that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Surely they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, it was at a bad level: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President in 2000-08 was a firebrand and supporter of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation has developed that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been touted as the DPP's presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they too can cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has published plans for research institutes to serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems annoyed by this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will struggle to choose among potential candidates.
The KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's ratings were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will reorganize its cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for rapprochement are curtailed.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point of no return has passed."
Grammy Nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of Best New Artist
Speeches at the request of the president and the people are bound to notice.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is billed as one of the surprises of this year's Grammy Awards with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it's in line with Grammy rules, where an artist may not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album Chamber Music Society certainly marked a step forward, and with her lighthearted vocal style and nimble hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success scored by Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the Grammy judges rightly praise the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride for an album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against veteran saxophonist James Moody's Moody 4B and John Beasley's Positootly.
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge of steampunk won several well-deserved recognitions in the large ensemble category, with the competition of chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still courageous Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Classical music nominations at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards bring a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
The leading nomination goes to Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt's Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win the award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The Classical Music Producer of the Year category has five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for classical albums went to Bruckner and his Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary works include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for instrumental performances by a soloist with orchestra.
The L.A.-based composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed in concert with the Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony for recording Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who have received nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the transition classical category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosque in Temecula receives approval by planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics attacked the project for promoting terrorism and leading to the suspension of trade.
However, jurors decided Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and would be aesthetically pleasing.
"A lot of good people have come to support this project — Christians, Jews, you name it," Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
"As an American citizen, I'm very proud of that."
"It means that justice will always prevail."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against it are just shouting loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time was taken up by discussions with people who were for or against the center. Those voices were evenly divided, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty sunk into the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, tragedy that took place when terrorists attacked New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had been plaguing Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted more and more suitable space than the warehouse space he rented with a filter system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque in Mediterranean-style architecture will also have two minarets and will rise to a height of 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, approximately three miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the scope for the search for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and they say it's a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been thought to be fundamental until now.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either because of phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not evidence that this is some form of truly 'extraterrestrial' life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science.
For a long time, six main elements were considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after arsenic is replaced with phosphorus.
"It starts to amaze you what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
The finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report of the news released for discussion, which did not divulge details of the find, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report revealed the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that power biochemistry, and that the set of elements we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not an accidental find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she reasoned that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to replace one with the other.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms can have a very hard time separating these elements."
"However, arsenic is so different that, like phosphorus, it doesn't work. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better under the action of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic substitution, it increases the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic may appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example to prove it.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and scientists speculated that earlier life forms may have used it.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel have been found. The Los Angeles County Sheriff reported Thursday.
Four show dogs — two Akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis — disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they were spending the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share details regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to comment on the case.
They were overjoyed when their two Akitas were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akita Trace, a three-year-old male named Trace and a 10-month-old, Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds who had planned to compete this week in regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unfound until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on the couple's nearly month-long dog show travel.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of their room window.
They also took three dogs with them - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany pointer - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akitas and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it should have been cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who took them to the missing dogs. Dogs are implanted with microchips to identify them.
It was unclear Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
Leo is ready to roar again now that MGM's restructuring is getting final court approval
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start over.
New York's federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed creditors' "pre-packaged" plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
Thursday's ruling that the plan meets U.S. bankruptcy code requirements leaves no legal obstacles for MGM to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the heads of the slimmed-down studio.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources to allow for a $500 million loan to fund MGM's new operations and production.
Now it's about merging with an investment bank that needs $75 million on its own, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to sort out its finances as management struggled to afford $300 million in interest payments annually.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and turnaround expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial problems of MGM and the studio's 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay the $2 billion plus the funds demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper's companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will be paid $9.5 million.
Cooper's firms, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a $4 million success fee.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on the book "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros. Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, was looking for a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technology toys to keep your gift budget in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing toy, the iPad, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant hit to the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 beaded jump ropes or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers — Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club — and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law worked; This year's tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys with affiliate sites have appeared, the two most well-known toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except where otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, ages 3 and up) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their tummy.
With one press, the animal emits a tone, and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animatric doll on Elmo Live technology that can play Simon Says and can also walk moonshine thanks to its innovative wheel-locking folding leg.
Children test a dance instructor's Mickey toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a kid in the 80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer education toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, kids 3 and up), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn driving into fun with a self-correcting, witty workbook.
If you're looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for ages 3-8) is the cheapest option to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't have as effective learning as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for ages 3-12), Leapfrog's first major change to the Leapster series, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with older drives.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90, for ages 3-7) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five bricks no bigger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before time runs out; It's great for competing in improvised word formation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin, were represented at the highest rate.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate a code online, your child will receive enough Club Penguin store credits for any two items.
This could include roller skates or a Puffle animal.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for kids aged 5 and up), the newest in a line of button cell microrobots.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun when you make a maze out of cubes and see if he manages to find a way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog's mouth.
Introducing finer policing in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders semi-loudly with military authority.
He wanted the female members—China's burly enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their crackdown and penchant for violence—to convey an impression on the crowd of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, he whispers softly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are lined up as if by a ruler.
Four headgear fits perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said dismissively.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city mandated that new conscripts have a college education.
Guangdong province has changed its gray-green uniforms to supposedly more attractive blues.
Wuhan replaced staring with powerful weaponry in central China: in 2009, one report reported that 50 officers surrounded a snack cart and stared at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and drove off after half an hour.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose surgery as their main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its municipal police force, who were selected specifically for their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, the gentler, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors in Hubei province beat a bystander to death after he used his mobile phone to film their actions in a protest against a landfill.
Last year, police officers were trained in Beijing, and the training manual was stolen and posted on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat up offenders without signs of blood.
This year, a watermelon peddler in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded online, shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scares the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after further discussion over tactics.
The paper read, "really thoroughly cleaned."
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the county advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real duties or are just a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district required female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportions."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - that is, more than 1.6 meters.
Retired at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the work is too mentally demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com government-like website.
"Female candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which are then determined by others, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the character and the "inner qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city government, disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both genders.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the question of good looks is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Disabled or crippled will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked man to serve with us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch in Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, cheeks like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a wry look.
Her dimply co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are bigger than just herding businessmen into the aisles where they can do their business.
Every morning, the group faces more than a dozen marketeers who run around on foot or on bicycles, trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you this many times!" said Miss Xu as the marketeer began to run away, leaving his bike with the noodle cart for a time.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's basically the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing in her spare time.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers of their male counterparts to seize goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency, then, is to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after false rumors spread that police had killed a vendor.
More than ten police officers or officers were injured during the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace of mind can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from quiet Baoguang Square, where female police officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the pavement instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry all he wanted.
A 15-minute distance in front of the policemen, looking angry, elbows against the vehicles and quickly off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator affiliated with the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who now have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in image maintenance and polishing.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"Most of the time, it's the public who start it."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who, until the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said it was "certainly pleased" by the decision, which followed nearly a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action before the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of an investigation and that there are no plans to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department, who argued that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents published in the October 2009 New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his aides, secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, remaining silent about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after Mr. Hampton was hired to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Because Hampton was until recently an assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was barred by law from lobbying by his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were friends before the affair, occurred in violation of the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was made public, "it became clear that this was a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for the Senator Ensign decision, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said the department was cautious about political lawsuits after a large number of setbacks, including a decision last year to suspend charges against former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the advocacy group that has filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's general counsel, said in an interview that he received a call from the Justice Department attorney on Monday and then the next day and told him that the department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensigno's defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had passed on to prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Justice Department other than that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop its investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethics group alleges that Ensign's parents' $96,000 payment to the Hampton violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
One company Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work for was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
An email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began working as a lobbyist at the company, Mr. Ensign's chief staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had been "bashing" the Home Office about the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and urged the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hire Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first broke last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he plans to run a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow suit the Justice Department and end the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people," she said.
Cheshire City Appeal Turns to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were writing in the courtroom rows.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says more than 140,000 Twitter messages were about raping and tying children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, and a family, was held and an official death penalty was to be held, which the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal with requests and arguments that would likely occupy the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the trial — including the widespread use of Twitter by major reporters — created a "circus atmosphere," and this widespread, imminent leak of information in outrageous detail then misled the jury in making decisions in terms of being influenced by public opinion.
That statement could force judges to consider whether, with the advent of new technologies, new courtroom rules should also be required.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' lead defense attorney.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the state's high court briefly dismissed claims regarding last week's ruling, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest the jury acted under public influence.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its ruling that Sheppard v. Maxwell was a "carnival atmosphere" at the media trial.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later, might be surprised to argue that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate out of the courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School law professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtrooms could make the trial fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes' lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Defense attorneys also argue that Mr. Hayes' case may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrific criminal photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the scale of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict made last month that the case dominated the Connecticut news and was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly fanning the flames of emotion about the case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras, and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "was something never before seen here in New Haven, and may be a national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter's operations is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports given later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should control the scope of further trials.
But some lawyers have called for appellate courts with the oft-used argument that social and technological changes require adjustments to the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are seeking that right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision in Dr. Sheppard's judgment because of the breadth of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can politeness bridge the chasm?
After a campaign notable for its offensiveness and negativism, a small amount of courtesy emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation or just an illusive moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and House leaders yielded no major discoveries on the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the session.
In any case, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
Wednesday's public session of the president's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that the close cooperation over a period of several months has built a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to argue that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in a trial period, probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience in the face of a renewed party war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting, and its later evaluation by the participants, was carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too vast and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the situation that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's a tax, spending, health care, or rights issue, both sides are miles apart.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"These are inevitable after the elections.
The elections stirred up the emotions of the party members, and they then fell silent.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed in the session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cut expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like a likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because Republicans can't watch them support tax cuts for the have-nots while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a bipartisan relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term returns to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism — which is largely widespread — that courtesy will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at everything that happens between now and 2012 as a shadow box, with the main events occurring in 2012," he said.
The reasons have much to do with the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of hyperbole, knowing that they must live up to their promises and cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These adherents are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their opinion, to push the deficit issue to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation, and they have fought to get as close to that number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the jury, who suggest that on financial issues we have, at least today, a small foundation or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and House Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of partisan conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address the budget, taxes, and health care, followed by a period of greater partisan cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite partisanship in the last election, a majority of Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
If it could lead to a stalemate, as it was in 1995, then both sides will watch public reactions very closely.
Anyone threatened with a reduction in votes is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
This may be an optimistic point of view.
Partisanship and direction are greater today than they were in the mid-nineties, and it turns out that a larger ideological divide has formed between Obama and the Republicans than it did with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to a more important election in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US documentary portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" that continues with some of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in records from February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal deals, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy — what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "office vertical" — will take its toll when money begins to move up the ladder.
The footage, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on WikiLeaks' website on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large role in corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can observe only minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction firm, for many years constantly denied allegations of corruption, and won several lawsuits for false accusations for such allegations.
In September, he said on a Russian television station, when asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's filth, it's rubbish."
Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show in the vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details spoken in such a way in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its connections to criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of the criminal and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Public Prosecutor's Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are in the second tier."
"Finally, at the bottom are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It's an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas because the city doesn't provide some services."
The report says the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police target smaller businesses.
One source said, "shop owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Internal Affairs (rather than from organized criminal groups), as they not only have more weapons, resources and force than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer as popular."
The record says that while withdrawing money is complex, protection itself may already be struggling; Even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their shops are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, presumably stuffed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow-based Indian research team, said in a recent interview.
"But it's part of that bureaucracy."
"He is not part of the political class, because in Russia there are no longer political classes."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year nationwide.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm among the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue about the solution of the problem.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin said the documents released by WikiLeaks may have been forged and reacted angrily to claims that US diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev's Robin.
"The truth about the whole thing is that it is our interaction that is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to come to terms with the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, Anlong Veng High School's principal reminded the man who built it, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "Butcher" for his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge possession in northwestern Cambodia, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge relinquished power, long-standing loyalty in Anlong Veng is also being eroded.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that explain to children for the first time the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN and Cambodian court handed down the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing former leader, the notorious Tuol Sleng violent association, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, unrest has grown among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It separates families."
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease, or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary directed guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-nineties, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to its first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their benefactors no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters had sunk into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them have nostalgic memories of the movement's time.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people benefited minimally from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were brought up with no idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, struggled in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everybody."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Che, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leaders and those responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late seventies.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent sweltering evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the parched grasses, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court seeks out more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer conditions means sticking together broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center has published the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, it has 75 pages and is entitled "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng knew few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be prosecuted."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains is a path overgrown with weeds and strewn with discarded plastic bags that leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered in a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned in a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, a lot of local people come here and pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and she planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to have its stockpile of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was made public in a joint statement issued after the security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and they seemed to have stumbled upon a stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a pair of covert operations have been conducted with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material — around £500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a sensitive issue.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to secure an invitation to the former Soviet republic to a follow-up summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 nuclear security summit."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear safety group.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries dispose of all of their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium — hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was concluded on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is unsuitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust-based basis," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will seek to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's announcement hints at the possibility of a gradual thaw.
"We welcome the progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make a big deal with CIA flights
The Spanish government did not make a fuss about CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and al-Qaida members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid said in his cable.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to El País, which also say that the then First Deputy Prime Minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, demanded that the Spanish executive be informed "so that it can show that it has proper oversight of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication "took the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no problem with intelligence flights through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so they are not "caught off guard," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
Then-Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to keep the matter as low as possible, but because the matter was in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited influence."
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or any sensitive information," the embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concern more about "apparent coordination between a Spanish judge and German prosecutors" than about the declassification of CNI or Defense Ministry information.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to handle this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, on the occasion of a lunch by U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the ambassador was told that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit," he had already instructed his associates "to avoid inflammatory comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the actions of the Partido Popular (PP) political party in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or willfully ignored U.S. conduct that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures could have negative consequences for the U.S. government."  noting.
Admitted mother-murderer complains online about maternity "worries"
A young woman talked about a child when it was already dead, and she had her blog: "Galician Terror."
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she had used since childhood, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the municipality of Noia in the La Coruña region, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimonies of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They dated for one year.
Shortly after they separated, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, it is clear from the content of her communication that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is kind of upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address to send you the baby."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the little one with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," she says.
In May, he talks about his return to his home: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go because of work so I don't lose the job."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with her.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, me, and I'll never leave him with anyone but my mother," a questionable intent given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When he taps out this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but on the other hand he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and quite likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He (my son) will be going to summer school there, so I'll save a little money on a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"Big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos by email, look how he wants, meet me, sex is needed."
On the thirtieth another message: "The boy is doing well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also a message about Víctor, the current partner: "He gives me money."
On the Internet, Mónika's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself "Muki ex-inmate."
"Galician Terror (motto)".
The last man she lived with, a guardian, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Yesterday, Mónica entered a provincial penitentiary in Palma, where she arrived from a detention centre in Menorca.
Defense attorney Carlos Maceda said the defendant had no memory of how it all happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
She had previously admitted to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party would gain 4 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the PSC would lose 9 seats
with the results of November 28, the PP could have the final say in the town halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes won and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has a given idea of universal elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually one of the same as in Catalan elections.
In the 2008 general election, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes, compared to 316,222 in the 2006 autonomous election.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this trend of increases, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, is maintained, the party's analysts have calculated that if general elections are held, the PPC could get 12 deputies in the Chamber of Deputies compared to the current 8, the CiU party would also gain 4 seats (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (it now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of vital importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis by the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - it now has 3 - while the ICV would still have one seat or win one more.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next meeting will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of socialist domination in the four provincial capitals and also on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest expected budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree on the possibility that the PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and would not be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for the party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - since at least 5% of the vote must be obtained.
The PP has increased the number of votes won in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists believe they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they governed together with the PP party under the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, has a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The People's Party also won at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
PP is currently represented in 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create lists in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provides thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian who were detained by agents of the General Information Commissioner in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand that arranged passports for various Al-Qaeda groups, including the 'Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam' and 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', the latter being the author of the Mumbai bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure through "Operation Kampai" the weakening of the counterfeiting apparatus of al-Qaeda at the international level and "limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then delivered to the groups that make up the al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their "fighters" could travel with impunity across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, which is why other European police units took part in these investigations in addition to the Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the coming days there will be interventions in other European countries similar to the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (in which Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another developed in Thailand, in which Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were captured.
It was these men who ran a cell based in Spain from Bangkok and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, stole passports from tourists that met the demands of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, they had to be valid for several years and they had to be without a visa.
The investigative documents stress that so far no facts are known linking the Catalan detainees to the Mumbai bombing, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", is said to have been one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which were "deposited" to buy mobile phone cards, which were later used by members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) demands that Mas halt fiscal deal
Yesterday, the leader of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia), Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to present personally to Arturo Maso her conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat; These conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky ventures such as the economic deal that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party came to the meeting with Arturo Mas with certainty of the 18 seats won in last Sunday's election, a figure more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that the nationalists would like to keep in the Chamber of Deputies when the general election is held, but so far the talks that Mas is currently holding with the rest of the political leaders are in a Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to win her support for the inauguration, "she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberating speeches", as well as an economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque Country - on which the CiU leader even wanted to put to a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the bloated political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations over Mas' inauguration will be dealt with within the PP party by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will meet today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths were not due to a "lack of measures."
Olot's performances do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed there - killed at least eleven elderly people in his care.
The director of the nursing home, Joan Sala, arrived accompanied by the facility's lawyer, attorney Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the appropriate authorities."
In addition to the reputational damage that the institution may suffer due to its failure to detect the carer's criminal activities in good time, the demands for material compensation, which are already being calculated by the lawyers of the survivors' families, now pose a major threat to La Caritat's home.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of a retirement home, suspecting that in many cases the deceased were not examined by any doctor personally, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
Yesterday, La Caritat, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme, stressing that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there are no indications in the case that any third person other than the accused himself has committed misconduct."
The man, now nicknamed the "Angel of Death," admitted to 11 deaths yesterday and said he committed his first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by administering too much insulin, unlike the first case, when he used a mixture of tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat said it was complicated to control staff access to medication.
In six cases out of nine, insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were likely the means the caregiver used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve their suffering.
However, only the analyses now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is not lying and was indeed looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by giving them lye, as he has already admitted in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe the medic's claims, nor do they rule out that the number of those killed may be higher than he confessed, and they justify their behavior in the various versions that Vila brought to court, knowing that he had to change his actions when it emerged that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say that they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full extent of this matter.
The European Central Bank threatens
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to yesterday's threat by European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Marginal differentials closed forcefully, and European bank shares fell more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying that it should withdraw the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy the sovereign debt for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity rates within the deadline and leave unlimited access for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to forecast liquidity levels "until at least March" and adhere to a three-month bid with unlimited access until the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and even announce an intensification of it.
If they do not meet the expectations created, they will recreate the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to pull down the level of liquidity, God be with us!
It was the same at the congress in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, Armored Fist announced on Monday and Wednesday that it had already bought many, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's auction of bills of exchange for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting the change in market sentiment that occurred after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures representing losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated amounts are about $10,000 million in short-term securities and another potential $15,000, and by February they have a chance of becoming private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem through stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the relief plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get parliamentary approval of the new budget and still lacks support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in her face for the next meeting of EU leaders on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister yesterday had the opportunity to present a plan of measures that will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment - it sounds to investors' ears like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5%, twice as much as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain was quick and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in great demand to help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
To call for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - 40,000 million in cash is available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - high rates and market access would close us off sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy of Caesar's wife - "not only to be but to appear to be" - must continue to be used.
We can do it.
Eulen Group President Challenges Vega Sicilia's Actions Requested by His Children
The storm in open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not abating.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, will challenge El Enebro's legal action scheduled for 16 this month and demanded by five of its seven descendants, in which they should try to extort their majority and seize the procuration of Bodegas Vega Sicilia with the help of the administrative authorities.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over control of part of society.
The founder of the largest enterprise services holding company seems unwilling to ease his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro group.
He was removed from its administration committee by five of his seven descendants, who were appointed leaders during the shareholders' meeting on January 18 of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro court hearing scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, convened by an official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has once again renewed the thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
An appeal to the judge is the only legal means that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is considered by David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children to use judicial deceit and clear legal fraud to reinforce and improve the January 18 negotiations, which were completely invalid."
That line of argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge to that conduct as 'completely insignificant'.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried without success to get the court to convene a hearing in June.
In El Enebro, the group that owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires a right to use 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when hearing the question of a court challenge to the hearing. A date for that trial has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with Siemens' secret weapon
The software suggests improvements in vehicles in real time.
Ever since Red Bull burst into the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
Initially, no one took the possibilities of this newcomer team too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without wishing to diminish the driving skills of champion German Sebastian Vettel or the capabilities of the Renault engine that powers his car, a legend has been born in the world of Formula 1 – the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for purposes far removed from motor sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision instruments.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon's camera, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Industrial Division at Siemens, explains that the use of the software enabled the Red Bull team to make modifications and improvements "in a few hours, in near real time" that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology, who analyse and design every type of modification of racing cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull racing cars except the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced manufacturing systems using a laser and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical achievement is $40 million, which is the maximum that any Formula 1 team can spend in any period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its race cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that takes place here is considered a "great mystery".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two drivers - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull in Formula 1 is undoubtedly the new champion Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the immense technological means that the energy drink brand has put into its participation in the race track, however, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Five years ago, it could be said that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% to victory, and the rest was due to the drivers.
Today, this ratio has changed, and technology is behind 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 of its own stores over two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes, inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The business will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrera, vice president of HP Spain, cited as an example the newly converted Pont Reyes Gran Vía store in Barcelona, with which HP has worked for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 points of sale in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), making the Barcelona store the third.
Herrera did not want to reveal where other stores would open, but admitted Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrera, who also leads HP's HR systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
Here, the North American company advises on an exclusive store furnishing design (with products that can be tried out interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with the provision of personnel for stores.
Helena Herrera denied that this was franchising, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, SME shopping services, service, after-sales service and even packaging".
The store in Barcelona is part of a world-class pioneering pilot program to address any problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to the Technical Center located in Maastricht (the Netherlands).
"That way, we can solve problems in 10 minutes that might otherwise take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses and ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contractual service of technical assistance," Helena Herrerová emphasized yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on "stealing" a million clients from its competitors over three years
More optimistic than other bosses, Bañco Sabadell's delegated board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of passive warfare.
Nevertheless, it expects to lower interest rates, but they will try to compensate for them by lowering bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to gain one million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The aim, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public assistance in FROB, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private clients - or 700,000 if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - since until now the AI Institute has pampered small and medium-sized businesses and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already gained 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, compared to more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
Few banking institutions dare to set goals and make them public at this time, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required expansion for another period.
Clients who leave savings banks will be their main target group.
At a meeting hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the road out of the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And, although they believe that passive warfare - which reduces margins - is receding, the price of risk premiums that banks and savings banks pay for their issues to receive liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, thereby compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans".
"We haven't turned off the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued orders to his network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices – see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is to reduce commissions," but there is a "competitive framework."
Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but, as usual, the Group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required".
"Next year there will be no stone left unturned," he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are "greatly reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institution will enter the red.
And he points out that FROB can substitute for the accumulation of funds in the market before a new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive a temporary market closure, what some bankers predict is a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, short-term financing can be obtained using repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rules out another wave of savings bank mergers
The CEO of CECA yesterday denied that there would be another wave of savings bank mergers, again insisting on the speed with which the sector is being reorganised.
When the process of pooling Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a new wave of such operations should emerge.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are the conventions."
"Most are completely executed; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the big processes are already done and under the protection of the Bank of Spain, which cooperated very well in this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting, Olavarrieta described that the concentration process is taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with how it is reflected in the instalments that at the time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he stressed.
"Moving from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that show a "lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we need to be on deadline before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, attributing a "lack of knowledge" to those who question this.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as a system that has mastered a "very important" process of concentration and that continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking had come out very well from the stress tests conducted by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions provoked a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, to the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the administrator of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret these emotions?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the idea of keeping old traditions that many of the other members hold.
In the face of European resistance, speculation in Germany is beginning about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although now it may seem like science fiction, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to recast the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary stringency, fines for offending states, possible postponements of payments for some of them, and an extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for prevarication now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission fueled deficits in 2009, the German government pulled constitutional reform up its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a discrepancy between what Germany thought was right (plans for austerity and stability of public finances) and what was practiced by its European partners, including France.
The second was shown by the Central European country when Merkel painfully delayed the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also made public were strongly opposed to the Greek bailout.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear position, calling for the European Union's conventions to be reformed so as to allow a member state to be rescued and, at the same time, to oblige private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it hastened the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat watered-down form, was approved, and we should monitor the Union's reform process over the coming months, which should allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures need to be taken now that they seem to disagree with very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mark the birth of a new currency zone in which offending states will be severely penalised and may be forced to announce postponements of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is telling us that we must follow a strict path of growth with increased savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and building, with huge balance-of-payments gaps such as prevailed during Spain's boom years, is simply not tolerable.
The offer is clear.
And we would be making a mistake if we did not understand it.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions we could be mistaken ourselves.
I hope that this current turbulence will be replaced by more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us until spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his twin statements (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that, despite criticism of Merkel, the way has been opened for the idea of putting things right.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem to want to move it.
And leaving a eurozone full of not very serious countries cannot be ruled out among the options that can be considered.
Now, Germany will always be able to tell us that she warned us.
Sport and circumvention
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show wit, not an intention to escape punishment.
The alleged contrived sending off of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this was unsportsmanlike conduct and whether UEFA should eventually punish the two footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won), the named players one by one deliberately lost time at the moment when a foul should have been played, in order to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will fulfil their prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in the top of their group - and will be able, stripped of their cards, to continue to the next stage.
In the end, UEFA's disciplinary committee imposed a two-match penalty on coach Jose Mourinho and the offending players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, rules that are unwritten but monitored.
Part of the discussion in this case arose thanks to the fact that Real Madrid (who boast of generosity and honour in their anthem, and who have already fined their players for similar acts) and the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these acts involve circumvention of the law; These are, indeed, events that respect sporting rules, the meaning of which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is being discussed what type of damage such actions cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the requirements of sportsmanship is the physical inviolability of opponents, which in these cases was not violated, i.e. there was no violent play.
Another of these elements characterizing a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opposing team due to their offense - which also did not happen here.
Thus, the paradox of the Real Madrid players' actions is the fact that there was no what we normally characterize as a ruse or circumvention of the law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid a sanction, but this behavior should have been as obvious as possible in order to receive a penalty.
They waited and gladly received the punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage the culprits will have from their intentional transgression.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that no benefit will be achieved in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even this is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardise their participation in a future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and besides, by doing so, the players will be punished and move to the second round of cards, in which one less card is needed to eliminate than in the first round.
So as the rounds go ahead, it won't be entirely clear if this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which involves making strategic decisions that allow maximum benefit to be obtained within the rules.
In the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between wit and circumvention of the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because there were two self-exclusions, and because of the way in which the transmission of instructions to provoke them from the management took place.
The damage to sporting principles by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Battle of offers to host Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year's calendar dictates concentrate an avalanche of bookings on December 16 and 17.
The number of celebrations paid for by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros is rapidly increasing.
Like Turkish honey or the lottery, with the arrival of December pre-Christmas parties are coming again, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but due to the crisis they have resulted in a struggle to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, according to the entrepreneurs and associations from the sector.
To complete the complication of numbers, this year's calendar (with Christmas Eve falling on a Friday) concentrated requests for the week of December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for peak days (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay their party expenses out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of bearability, according to Gaieta Farras, president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona restaurant association.
A representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities at the moment does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be like this month.
"People think twice before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to the subject of pricing, they're cautious," he adds.
Stores will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a reasonable price", he says, noting that due to the crisis, customers tend to go down a notch and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey of various properties shows that the biggest onslaught of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with most requests for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adapted to the menus on offer, whose total prices range from 25 to 30 euros.
In another major company, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year's calendar has brought more early bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have done the possible and the impossible to maintain last year's prices, and our menus, which everyone should choose from, range from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
The AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic and QuQu and has a total of 23 companies, remains optimistic after seeing an increase in earnings since the second half of the year and has a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company's sources stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations between friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of €30 or more, as they noticed a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava compared to last year.
They have also noticed that companies are already inviting their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Enric Goma, vice president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Centre Association), believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that bookings have "recovered" even though clients are "bargaining to the maximum".
That impression hasn't faded during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan's Nuclear Program Spawns Great Unrest in the US
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country."
The Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published by Wikileaks confirm the extraordinary unease caused in Washington by Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of the communications and ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states on nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "is in decline" and that the unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled but stored in pieces to make it more difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is what Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson calculates in a report before the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of atomic material transport."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer observed not only by the U.S., but also by Russia, as spreading and presenting reason to be wary.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or missile programs," expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry said at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news of the Julian Assange dossier is the increasing lack of cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, which described communications with Pakistan as "frustrating," said: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected'.
In another report, Peter Lavoy, the national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other nation in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "make it very clear" during the visit of Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani army must stop tacit support for terrorist groups."
The Hunt for the Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red notice" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary call", the so-called red notice, to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Besides, this call is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Mark Stephens, a lawyer for the creator of Wikileaks, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was 20 November when the international police force, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, Interpol's 188 countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "with a view to placing him in temporary custody and extraditing him."
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person subject to a red notice, many Member States, as the organisation explained, nevertheless consider a 'red notice' to allow an arrest to be made - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially where states have a reciprocal agreement on extradition of detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be.
The move has outraged Assenge's lawyers, who published a paper yesterday claiming that the thirty-nine-year-old Wikileaks founder has shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, whom they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not legal persecution," the letter states.
While the whole world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine, in which he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy at the United Nations in violation of international conventions to which the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the demand for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Rusella Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks as a terrorist organization "so that anyone contributing financially or otherwise assisting them can be intervened and prosecuted."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went even further, saying Assange should "be killed," which he subsequently had to retract.
"Obama should put a bounty on him or use a drone or something."
One who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient," he said on Fox
Puigcercós seeks calm in the ERC by "winking" at Carod's supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot to remain in it.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to combat the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, which has been fruitless due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the vote.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot worry about it as much as he had with other defunct currents.
That is why the leader of the Left will try to win over new critics by winking, which will help him arm himself for the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to secretly vote on his continued tenure.
By ballot, not by raising hands.
If Carod's supporters want to give the chairman a punitive vote, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splitting and subjugating himself.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentages, that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Carod's supporters demand more from the president than to make his position available - which they see as a gesture that carries no weight, since Puigcercós controls the largest body at the congresses.
But since they don't have a sufficient majority to force resignation, they will try to remind the executive of the plan between now and May.
Because of this, they expect to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document, which the leadership will vote on to the national council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to move the congress in the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader said that "polyvocacy" harms stability, and that his goal is that once and for all the organization will be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
in this context, the article that current consultant Josep Huguet signed on his blog seems significant.
After taking into account Puigcercós's ideologue, the innovation consultant took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for a few goals."
And he named five of them, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means including new faces who are from the Carod-friendly sector.
The second goal can be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC completely end meetings as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates chosen by voting.
Ending the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish political party system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós' team, which has fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, a convulsive assembly in 2008 decided that the meeting must be considered at a special congress on the reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it might be a good time to look at this issue again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in the month of November; 390 in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to MILENIO.
Among the murders, the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separated bodies in the Valley of Mexico stand out.
In the penultimate month of the year, Mexico has a total of 390 killings, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases, the discovery of a corpse stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a coup de grace to the head and had her hands and feet handcuffed with a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the Naucalpan district.
Early in the morning of Thursday, November 4, the co-operatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal bullets to the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in a section of the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcóyotl, a fifty-year-old man was murdered by eight shots after he came out of his house to start collecting garbage.
On the seventh of November, two victims aged 30 were killed by a gunshot to the head in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the district of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, the body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, and a cartridge from a caliber 25 gun was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in a sewage canal in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Emergency services conducted a thorough search for other parts of it, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlan reported finding the body with its hands tied back and its head wrapped around it at the site of Pena Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men was reported after they were wrapped in bed linen and left in the trunk of a vehicle at Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district, and death threatening messages were also found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the Los Reyes La Paz district.
in a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the seventeenth, two women were found dead wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan a man was found slain wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, who was preliminarily identified as Mario Ríos according to the report the killers left on his body.
In Ixtapaluca, in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla, a woman with no signs of life was found with two wounds to the back of her head.
Tattoos of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte were discovered on the woman's skin, as well as necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, the body of a man was found in a car in the village of Zinacantepec with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped in tape were found in the village of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, there was a report, probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: "This will happen to those who do not conform."
In Ecatepec, two bodies bearing marks of torture and had bound limbs were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes, La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl districts.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and carrying a message; while the other was tortured to death and was found in a plastic wrap on the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents found a note with a message.
China Sticks to Its Goal of Reducing Greenhouse Gases
The country's representative at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and said it stands by its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN climate change conference, assured.
In his first public address at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this matter together with the international community.
He reported that China's climate change strategy is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programs.
They have already seen progress on all these points, including last year's passage of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further stressed that in China, federal agencies worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, efficient energy use and reducing emissions.
Further, he said, various multi-year plans are in progress or have already been completed, funded by both the Chinese government and other governments.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been put in place over the last five years and has received investment from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
A provincial climate change project, a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving light bulbs, and a mitigation and adaptation project are also underway, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, he described, greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for a 9% historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Expulsion of Espina enacted: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional) said that the former chairman of the PAN party is entitled to demand his right from the National Order Commission.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been enacted and that the former chairman of this party was entitled to apply to the National Order Commission to demand his right.
In an interview conducted before the objection was raised by the governor of the state, Gabin Cué Monteagudo, he said that the expulsion of Espino is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Riot Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Order Commission of the National Council in his case in order for it to be a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He went on to explain that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she has never been at the negotiating table for the presidency of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his confidence that the PAN would emerge stronger from the internal elections held on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (the 2012 alliance) is an issue that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was an intention for local elections that was successful and served its purpose," he said.
The PAN chairman said that 71 years of dialogue have stood behind his party and therefore "we are not frightened by internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said the committee can unquestionably elect the best chairman PAN deserves for the next three years, so it will pass the baton to "whomever the committee designates."
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five."
He predicted that the rise the party saw in the last election in July would be reflected in future contests, although "there is no time to think about 2012 yet".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
in this context, he stressed that the three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, since "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about President Felipe Calderón's critics of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) Because of his speeches during the four years he has ruled, César Nava invited PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Cladero, let them defend them, let them come out of their shell," he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive branch has the right to express himself as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, since there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama Promotes Law on Twitter to Support Undocumented Students
"If you think the passage of the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and urge them to pass it," the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined a national rally in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize undocumented students, by posting on his personal Twitter account.
"If you believe the passage of the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and urge them to pass it," Obama tweeted.
His short report highlights an online link to a more extensive document asking the public to get in touch with senators immediately as a vote on the bill approaches.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block passage of any bill unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is passed.
Such a block, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could influence votes on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there is still plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we can reach an agreement on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of the other issues," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would request a "vote to close the debate" on the Dream Act, so a proposal to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though a more likely one is next week.
Senate passage of the Dream Act would legalize the roughly 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have been in the country for the past five years, and have been enlisted in an institution of higher education or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, so they need the help of several Republicans, so its adherent organizations are conducting intense agitation to secure the bill's passage.
Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has expressed support for the bill.
That's why supporters of the Dream Act need to win over a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the bill.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are negotiating the most are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it again.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John McCain, has not yet commented.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature, they put their finger into the wound ("Poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "to put a finger in the wound" is analogous to the Czech "to strike the nail on the head - ed.
The second round of the cycle The Pleasure of Language was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in Language, but... A finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to open the second round of The Pleasure of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another fair, they discussed the topic of Sex in Language at a round table, she explained).
Finger in the wound "brings us into trouble", the Argentine writer said sweetly to an audience composed mostly of young people who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear this roundtable debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and attended by Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celrio, which Schultz described as a great short story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what a "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not receive answers, although traces of the same story do.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "patience is not my strong point, maybe it will be my wound".
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the trip, but explained that wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents the really open and the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she only managed to learn so much about the wound, that it was really open and that it did not exist", but she became convinced that pleasure and pitfalls in language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nikaraguan Sergio Ramírez also gave a delightful narrative, which he called In Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but appears at one point.
with elements of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress who played the clouds, bringing back people who had gone far away, or correcting the chastity lost by a virgin, this narrative that then turned to America to speak, a great novel in which from the beginning its own chroniclers were not lacking in telling it, and Bernal Díaz del Castillo is quoted here as criticizing the exaggeration in the narratives of conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us (writers), mocked the false testimonies that were presented as real in the stories, but in any other way never managed to tell the story of America with such imagination that it lacked even shame."
However, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination," and it is precisely where reality and falsehood merge, where it is no longer known which of the story belongs to one group and what to the other, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
This he calls indeed the "Cervantian tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Montero emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its talk Finger in the Wound made possible.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer has pointed her finger at the great wound of social violence that is sweeping through her country - and shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a tacit compromise, which of course is not intended," she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is formed between the author and the reader — and in their "chemical reaction."
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized "this finger in the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which is teeming with dogmatisms, it is forgotten "that behind every "yes" there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes."
"To be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and to color is to put a finger in the wound many times and harass those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in caricatures, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also to harass authorities who prefer this black-and-white world," he said, to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, experienced both good and bad during his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different styles will also collide, characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced both good and bad during his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has left with nothing, which is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winners and curiously played with the same team the following final.
As a coach, the Santista strategist reached his first Apertura 2002 final, holding the reins of Morelia Club, losing 4–2 on aggregate to Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with an aggregate score of 3–1, which was against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Sausages" after 210 minutes of play tied 2-2, after a series of penalty shots he got into a three-on-one advantage and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed from 11 steps and the team suffered a turnaround to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to come out victorious, I don't want to break statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I owe and of course the title would be for me as well, but the first is the most important," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
He vividly remembers the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee blows the whistle we cannot celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we have learned from this, until the game is over, we cannot celebrate".
He is not concerned that this series could be decided in penalty shots, he trusts his players: "You never try to get a series of penalty kicks, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were ready, but unfortunately fate prepared a bad move for us, perhaps because of nerves or anxiety,  that we felt when the title was in our hands but we lost it, that left something in us and hopefully this time it doesn't happen."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other and taste for the first time the glory that titles bring.

As of January 10, 2011, the visa process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centres (ASC for short) before the interview at the Consular Department.
ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information and this will be evaluated by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including:
The total cost of obtaining a visa will be lower, there will no longer be a fee to arrange an appointment, the second for processing the application and another for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for application visas (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a business and investor visa.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to undergo an interview with a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC to present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Since biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who will require a second appointment with an interview at the Consular Section will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency has called a press conference for tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origins, evolution, spread and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When it invited journalists, NASA assured that it would present "a discovery that will cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could pose the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any life form, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere like Earth's.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the true reach of the discoveries at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who are studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón spawn an opposition "bloc"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartism," they claim.
The 60th parliamentary term had not even begun when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by MPs from the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), PT (Partido del Trabajo), Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four discussed one thing:  the arrival of "bipartism" in the Chamber of Deputies.
Before the start of the session at the opening of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo "thundered" against the reform of the Constitutional Law because it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, "Bapartism" begins, for now it will be two persons from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilara, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brito of the PAN party and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms institutionally constitute a political marginality at the behest of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and PAN.
He specified that in the coming days they would talk to representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be subjected to the two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"When they (the opposition coalition) got here, that's how I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergencia party said that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patrón and will therefore form a pluralistic group.
Congress cannot be allowed to be "duopolar" after being a monopoly.
The aspiration of law reform is not to have endless bipartism in Congress.
The group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that at present, Congress has become the "prey" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It used to be controlled by only one party, today it is divided between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked that the personality of the MP be respected and that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"So that the five MPs, who will probably already be nine, but right now they see us in five, do not stay out of the way, each in a different faction, because of the arched agreements, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that we are outside the reform that they have formed and agreed to, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200,000 pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán pays another cheque to the discussed owner of a company supplying electrical material.
Another cheque for a little more than 200,000 pesos was sent by the town hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This brings the amount paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying electrical material to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the City Hall's transparency page, this last cheque number 9258447 was sent on November 16 this year, was issued for the sum of 200,144.56 pesos and had as its subject stated "settlement of outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay an additional amount to the contractor, who has been monitored by the High State Audit Office for selling at high prices.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many more cheques will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it just pays what we owe it, as well as other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last on November 16.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government List, as stipulated by law in the case of companies audited by the High State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the contractor again at the town hall.
Previously, after July 25, the Noroeste newspaper published a review of checks issued by the city hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camaho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places are in dire need of maintenance
Tourism managers are complaining about an accident involving a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Sánchez Taboada's gazebo in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist falls into a hollow at Sánchez Taboada's party, the tourism sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that they had repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination to be taken into account, and the bad things tourists find there to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists strolling here and seeing the mess, adversely affecting nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea about the revenue that is leaking, otherwise they wouldn't be dealing with these issues for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance on the part of the city hall.
"The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to deal with preventive maintenance, not just repair existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, after all, as residents we deserve a clean residence, the city hall should change its strategy of maintaining the city."
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito.
"Nowadays, in order for tourists to come, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city abounding in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The necessary attention has not been paid here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to all, maintenance is lacking.
Speaking about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the city hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and tidy to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of the Tourist Graduation Ceremony, said that saving tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not being used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, but they will first need to be put in order to make these places more attractive and to be able to put them on the list we have to promote this destination."
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, would like MPs to take on great responsibility by leading by example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary term full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is being demanded by the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is in convulsions and facing major problems.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term is launched, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia party and the last from the PVEM party, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from the new members of Congress is that they be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patróns are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Business Coordination Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on great responsibility and lead by example on the path to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between parties, as they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why he spoke of the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move the rulers forward in order.
"We want them to do decent work and, above all, to be committed to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote in the last election."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives will be to gather all forces to achieve economic growth in the country, as the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way promote job creation."
On tourism, he called for new lawmakers to give it more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing foreign currency and investment, which, moreover, directly competes with agriculture."
In addition to spending funds on tourism start-up projects, Congress should help the state reassure and help with the alcohol bill, which failed to resolve in previous parliamentary terms.
Three Kings Sought
Dolls, toy cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the wish list of children in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their expectations on the upcoming feast of the Magi, as their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Caspar, Melichar and Balthazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in Colonia Salvador Allende, in poor circumstances, as the father does not have a steady job.
"So sometimes it's hard because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the 'plebeians' on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the children's mother.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he has wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like a one-year-old outfit.
"He (José Alfredo) told me 'I wish I had this monster car,' but I told him 'let's see my son' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalls with sadness.
For older children who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11, is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaías a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so a pair of size five and a half or six would suit him.
To help make the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuel family come true, you can take part in the "Finding the Three Kings" campaign, and bring a gift or cash at the Noroeste newspaper's reception.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen inspections were carried out in Estria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Tours were conducted in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in drug-producing sites.
"Approximately 750 beds of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of them alleged bosses of the network, two men from Sherbrook.
Those arrested had to report to the Palace of Justice in Sherbrooke following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian hemp, possessing it with the intent of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These searches followed a lengthy investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Mr Ruel said.
About 70 officers from the Estrie Regional Investigation Unit, the Quebec State Police, Sherbrook State Police, and Sherbrook Memphrémagog Police Authority participated in the police operation.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
A Conservative bill that the government says would regulate the problem of boats loaded with illegal immigrants will apparently be overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand tall on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill as drafted, a bill that would allow for the detention of up to one year of any person coming from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong goal.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government does," he said.
Olivia Chow, a critic of the NPD on immigration, dismissed critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that we take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we see as a core part of another bill, C-35," Ms Chow said.
"We don't support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and puts children in jail for at least a year," Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney blamed opposition parties.
"Canadians are telling MPs en masse that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat it as some kind of sycophant."
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Kenney said.
The government has not called a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election leading to its rejection.
One Conservative told QMI that the government would demand a vote so that any MP who opposes it be held accountable for their position to their constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry into the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, is trying to keep this idea from being forgotten: Quebec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation of New York as early as next January.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, despite the fact that Robert Dumil himself was present.
There was no need for public security critic, PQ party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and an "amateur solution botched on the knee."
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They'll settle for confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the examination of witnesses in open court.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest is affirming that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, as you and I do, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to create a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Senior Civil Servants.
In order to break this impasse, he suggested that Quebec grant special authority to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the inspector general," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to change the Penal Code to make it better suited to this type of crime.
This demand would come from the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law on this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Secretary of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his judicial colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to the file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Penal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangstership Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall hit several regions, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimeters were not expected between now and Thursday evening, by region.
Sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were hit hardest.
Up to 100 millimeters could fall there.
If we add this precipitation with the melting snow accumulated in some sectors, we can fear flooding in some watercourses.
The Quebec Emergency Service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière on Wednesday evening.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides forest, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become subject to flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall caused flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a makeshift bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes from their banks caused the closure of some roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The ambulance service is on standby and supervising the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a safety adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Center issued severe flood warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before Canada's Broadcasting Standards Council (RRTV) over controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians and, as well as rude language during broadcasts.
The Broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians in coarse language that does not correspond to the broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that the suicide discussions, including the broadcasting of the names of the two persons who took their own lives, did not violate radio broadcasting regulations.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the Common Front of Quebec Social Welfare Recipients.
The group complained that the amounts reported in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not deceptive information.
As for suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of desperation.
A majority of the Commission members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
'The majority of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the 'Dupont midday news' have tackled a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner.'
No complaint was made against him.
The latest dispute concerned the statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort engaged in a media firefight that provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said that he did not send any donation to help Haitians because we cannot know for sure that those in need will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative image of Haitians.
"I've already made up for my three-day postponement of the matter."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use harsh language in broadcasting.
In any event, CHOI-FM radio cooperated 'beyond the scope of its duties'.
For a station which, inter alia, will have to notify such decisions once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuvà Montreal.
An Algerian-born Montrealer, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange run.
An athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, enters the tatami and rings of the world and looks for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has now lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
"In my case, I look for fights a bit everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game that comes with martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man who works as a security guard and helper for UPS just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"They were invited by rivals who finished in the top four at the last World Cup in each category.
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"In 2005 in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007 in China I finished fifth in the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
"Interestingly, in every competition I made some progress."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches with fists and feet, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on a platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this form of fighting is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explains the nice guy."
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Stade Lumpinee [the biggest stadium in Thailand]."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors per category (80kg, 85kg, 90kg and 90kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million contracted without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed to $450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is the consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has won the most important contract, the $295 million project management contract without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of Énergie gérance, was authorised in 2004, in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec, to entrust to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any invitation to tender.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against a consortium of enterprises presents us with a serious problem of an ethical nature, which risks excluding competition and causing prices to rise.
"It's a new way to realize collusion and eliminate competition."
"This means that people no longer make side deals secretly, today they do them openly," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard put this question to the National Assembly, because he says that he bears heavily how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected in the afternoon, vigorously denying that the contract was collusion.
"I have my own way," she thundered, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked accuracy."
She said "that would be the least of it" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice around the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or several companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the complexity of the work.
Construction is already underway and must be scheduled by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to act; It was a business.
It must also be admitted that the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of engineering consultancy consortia is under investigation in the government.
A quick glance at the business register of Quebec companies will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult, to name a few.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular that "the territory of la Baie James is characterized by a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 70s".
Eastmain's lead patron, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), has given an explanation that will make us furrow our brows at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public tender and if there are few participants bidding, your bid prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, you pick up the people who are in the contract as participants in the competition, and you say: 'Let's make a deal satisfactory and with a good price.'
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that is important, but the competence of the people," confirmed Mr. Laporte.
This contract, awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium, is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts have been concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with firms or their subsidiaries, in particular laboratories performing soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in "Énergie gérance".
All contracts were concluded.
Together, they amount to $449,783,344, including a $295,131,564 contract with Énergie gérance.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good known Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "finance" it, before specifying that these are more likely to be its executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development actors, as well as "impartial" labels and environmental certifications, to be guided by their product choices.
The worst thing is that even as we bathe in a media universe that urges us to consume more socially responsibly, this media universe bemoans the lack of credible information, a failure to fulfill obligations that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, according to Baromètre responsible consumption, the first article of which was published yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still do not trust them very much
In fact, two-thirds of us say we don't believe companies' environmental promises, simply because green advertising companies find a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Observatory for Responsible Consumption.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the veracity of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that claim to be environmentally responsible, according to Barometere.
In the same way, politicians' discourse on this subject is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Nevertheless, responsible consumption information seems paramount to stimulate this aspect of consumption, which is currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would temper the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebecers' population is suspicious of the reported data on the products or "green" services we seek to let pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to rebrand one or several products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A full 61% preferred to buy from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, Baromètre said.
More "green" and responsible – the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year – Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving for the least possible impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Baromètre reports: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they use public transportation or recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in the interest of conservation.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavior survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus et le Parallèle Company, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a donation of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinema complex on the boulevard Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it wanted.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which, moreover, would be lower, some original expectations that could lay the foundation for a viable solution on favourable terms and with resources coming from the State.
The first action plan and the $12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and plan of action were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
It should be recalled that the Association of Cinema and Cinematographic Centre Owners of Quebec opposed direct investment by the State in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he had not done so for other cinema halls.
But several participants in the discussion, on the contrary, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was introduced to his cinemas within ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for the change by the state financial council.
The lack of screens for independent films is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its helm, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, hoping to raise $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on 27 February next year and screen Xavier Beauvois' most beautiful film, Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir, and so he ignores what he and his group think of the proposals for scaling back that are being made to him.
A raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
New diplomatic US sources, made known by WikiLeaks, reveal what the United States sees as an inferiority complex of Canadians vis-à-vis Americans, but in the same blow reveal their sense of superiority of the latter over Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter cares about Canadian-American relations when they vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to get its budget adopted in 2009!
four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, were put on public display yesterday, provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The communication, dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
Much to the astonishment of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
"Canada's inferiority complex, almost obsessive, may be conditioning political leaders to talk about internal bets instead of realizing that this election includes the United States (as in the 1988 free-trade campaign)," he writes.
"The United States," he concluded, "is the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to talk about."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It stands to reason that the ability of a candidate, party or, better yet, a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a message sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure that the government is retained in a confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade over a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan," writes M. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative image that CBC drama series are casting on the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for violent interrogation by the CIA can be seen.
Another report reports that in their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe was prepared to accept some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner's answer was yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State."
"The secretary accepted with the understanding that she would revise the file."
Finally, let us note that those involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the CBC airwaves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
It was reported and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World plan to restore lighting
Yesterday in Cancún, the UN proposed a plan to restore home, retail and industrial lighting in 100 countries with the aim of achieving a reduction in the greenhouse effect (GES) equivalent to almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the planet's climate between now and 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of large, concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the lack of hard-to-implement reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, with fluocompact bulbs or, better yet, incandescent bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be eliminated.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of car fleet emissions across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve a stabilization of climate warming at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to rule out that it will not get out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with new bulbs with DEL, we reduce this consumption twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, the kind launched this week by Philips — the company reportedly participated in a UN study — have an expected lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a red-hot bulb, giving us an idea of potential savings with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless producers set up collection points.
But, as the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact light bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants, which emit much of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centers circulate 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report also details the benefits that each country would make from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars a year on electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost $2.5 billion to build
Côte d'Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results, the UN President's spokesman stressed.
"It calls on all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed the latest date - midnight on Wednesday - to pass without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's scrutineering.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls circulated around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is relying on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" voting in the north, which has been administered by former New Army (FN) rebels since a failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Ivory Coast's presidential election campaign director, confirmed that the voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the Ivory Coast president from voting.
The elections could be annulled if the Constitutional Council had taken into account the complaints lodged by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any links with former rebels, denounced the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was seen as a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation for the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned Côte d'Ivoire's political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on October 31, as the winner with 38% of the vote, compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France by the International Employment Agency (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), according to provisional seasonal adjustment (CVS) data released by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed stabilized at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks, to work, and regardless of whether they are looking for a job or not.
The labour market situation of today's young people has intensified with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the International Labour Office.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, the same as in the year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 and over and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 recorded the benefit of unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics, reporting on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after standing at 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and taken into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public contracts allegedly obtained by stealth.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misappropriation of company assets, misappropriation of public funds and public property, concealment, bribes, accepting bribes to influence the office and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions he intends to ask him, not some delusions."
"It's easy to prosecute him for many reprehensible reasons, but it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini stated, through his lawyers, that he had sent a short message to the judge before his hearing in order to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew about anything like this, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was charged on Wednesday with misappropriation of public funds and conspiracy, leaving the protagonists of the whole affair free, under judicial supervision with a ban on contact.
"My client has been able to give explanations of all the facts he is accused of."
"The investigating judge is taking this into account and will let him go free," said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial surveillance, Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "theft and misappropriation of company property", the other for "conspiracy in misuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealing the misappropriation of company assets."
Among those who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently indicted in a parallel public procurement fraud case involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of helping to launder money from large-scale gangstering.
The investigation is being conducted in the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009, following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged procurement fraud, in particular in the waste case.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses mainly on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Élysée Palace exaggerated Syria mediation
Over a decade from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilde Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," united views in France, put diplomacy on combat alert and highlighted relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
The US documents, obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the drawbacks of this crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials on behalf of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are shedding light on the way in which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilde Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing about it.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on 12 August 2009 is headlined: 'Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages'.
Strategic Affairs Advisor to the Élysée Palace, François Richier, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, speaks with Allegrone, the representative of US diplomacy.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do as much to bring back to their own nationals, who are forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "constantly pronounce emphatically" in the media the words "fundamental rights of man", "innocence", "immediate deliverance".
An image-sensitive Iranian regime must be put into trouble.
"Do it all the more the more they ask you to stop."
Because there have been attempts at negotiation through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: hostage-taking for the purpose of 'political blackmail'.
It announces that Klotilde Reiss's release (which will take place on August 16, the day she is given refuge by the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (bail of €230,000).
And he announces that the Élysée Palace anticipates hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will intensify."
The Iranians "could arrest another 1800 or so French living in Iran in the future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago but remains blocked in Iran.
The information spreads: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims was expelled for illegal trade in Iranian-sensitive electronic material, is released in Paris following a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material destined for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France agreed to bargain?
Acquittal of an Iranian for the liberation of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Élysée Palace, he says, was not only "taken aback by the judge's decision", but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There were talks between the presidency and the minister of justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by French intelligence.
An Élysée Palace adviser dials a phone number, hangs up a telephone receiver, and then informs an American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Parisian buildings run by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotilde Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Élysée Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized "leaks" to the media, to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad that he is playing a "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, noting that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media 'bleach' of French officials.
What is the basis for such a level of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their eulogy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The documentary then deals with the reasons that forced the Élysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "aims to validate President Sarkozy's Syria policy," he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad, and has been described as premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating Syria's role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what eulogies it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"At the very least, this should introduce confusion and confusion among Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Élysée Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot."
The end of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Pecivalsky" that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for persons under the age of 16, officials from the Culture and Family Ministries said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, a senior official at the ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly available from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make free programmes available to people who so request, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly reports various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA designates the host countries.
Filled with turmoil over suspected corruption, Fifa's executive committee is being set up on Thursday by the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host countries, a selection highly politically motivated where influence fighting and lobbying risk overtaking technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the royal competition of Fifa in 2018will be held in Europe , the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 World Cup will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to set in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will attend the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Prince of Qatar, the leaders of the government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the scale of the economic and political bets around the world.
Negotiations behind the scenes run the risk of lasting until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy by candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) dossiers contain the best arguments, as does the documentation of their competitors.
But those reasons won't carry much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at voting hour.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of the revelation leading to the suspension of two CE members for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of its country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the World Cup only once, in a year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it aired a documentary that "pinned" three influential CE (European Commission?) members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA unhappy and get England's leaders into trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor in office, Tony Blair, who won London the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack the trump cards of already prepared stadiums, its testimonials (World Cup in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal allusions barely distorted to the accusations of the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States, with its considerable experience from 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the home of Fifa's main sponsors, this country seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for the two countries, which together underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: awarding the 2026 World Cup to China, which FIFA ardently wants, has rendered Asia's chances for 2022 null and void.
With Qatar pulling out a big ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new lands, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the meager TV fees (due to the time difference) paid by European countries, which are the driving force behind Fifa.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand gave the impression that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Élysée Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not coincide well with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persist all the time.
In one sense or the other.
In 2006, without being believed, Jacques Chirac's friends insisted that a third mandate should not be ruled out.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured with a serious expression that he would "decide sometime in the autumn of 2011."
As the UMP reminds members of parliament on Wednesday evening at the Élysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown a low-plate state.
Was this an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has commemorated presidential elections in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me ahead of you," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Do not think that I am not considering the next stage."
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; it will not make him a candidate, or less.
If they provoke comments, it is because of a double truth.
Speeding up the path to candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségolène Royal's entrance to the arena that is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want the arrangement into battle formations to be premature rather than intended.
Bad survey on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% vs 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this matter with the UMP," people close to the prime minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, leveled with the obvious.
Euro: Europe's central bank forced to continue its purchases of government titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council of the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the halt of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis obliges sovereign European claims, and the institute for issuing securities will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a worsening of the situation already tense on European securities markets.
The political cost would then be all the higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in resolving the crisis of European states' claims.
She would not say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example, by increasing its sovereign-bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...").
The night before, in Brussels, during his questioning by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove to be more eloquent about his intentions, contenting himself with stating that the programme of buying state titles on the secondary market was 'continuing' and that 'we will see how we decide' during this Thursday's meeting.
The only certainty: the European central bank will keep an eye on its key unchanged interest rate at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the central European bank's purchases of bonds from the treasury doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And thanks to the unwise of the market bargainers, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the anticipation market bargainers about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect any significant change in the exchange rate, either.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter proceeds to provide liquid funds without restriction on generous terms and for a duration of between one week and three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would be to accept the risk of triggering a short-term new tension," said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Adding to its plan of intervention in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of its bond purchases in order to revive a feeble market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposure of European banks to euro area sovereign debt markets, it has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It needs at all costs to make up for the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent a flare-up of paid output by states that are among the most fragile," a major bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates rise, countries will struggle all the more to reduce their debt instead of stabilizing it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government is hunching its back
After the start of the week, the worrying situation for Italy eased a bit, yesterday with the reflow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economy, the regional presidents said that they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unsolvable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied to attendees.
In any case, on Tuesday the deviation from Germany's long interest rates reached a record high of 210 basis points, and the price of bankruptcy risk cover contracts (CDS) soared to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with the "turbulent development of markets" and a possible contagion originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Plain and bluntly, its problem is a lack of growth and lackluster fiscal inputs, which go hand in hand and expose the state to the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for analysis is 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public finance deficit will still be 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against the 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new set of amendments to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, tough new measures will have to be taken", said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For now, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's board of directors under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts required in Italy are less than those required of other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be organised, which are planned for the end of March.
This would open a period of little choice in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion in interest rates on European government bonds has brought grist to the mill for governments and the Central European Bank.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, a target most heavily targeted by speculation.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and obviousness, based mainly on banking systems," said economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so because "political time runs slower than market time".
Aware of this broken link and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, most affected by the problem, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
This is in view of the Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank takes place today.
The fate of unconventional market-oriented support measures for euro area countries is on the agenda (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its managing director, Klaus Regling, launched a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this path is not to increase funds, it is certainly paving the way for achieving that goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilized funds through additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries primarily concerned, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards labour market organisation.
Reforms that complement strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid took a different route than Greece and Ireland used.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before applying their own budget corrections and deciding on the structural reforms needed to regain lasting confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about the options available to accelerate the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not hesitate to tap its stock of securities again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, the actor in the very first plan for a deal in European sovereign claims, believe that an addition of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exists: the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to date by EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions were deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have orange alerts.
Snow rations cause even more difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now on orange alert for the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne joined 20 districts that have already declared an orange alert, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later that night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is causing problems in the north of la Gironde and the Charentes forest, and light snowfall on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is large enough to cause traffic disruption and disrupt some economic activity, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and police recommend driving your vehicle only when it is really necessary, and some trucks have been cancelled for the day.
In Picardy, school services were banned on Thursdays.
No special measures are foreseen to restrict freight traffic on Wednesday evening.
The district office "urges all car drivers to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adapt driving to the nature of the road."
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10% to Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfall.
DGAC advises passengers using air transport services to contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Billions have rained since the debate on modernising transport on the Ile-de-France is in full swing.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular the EUR 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to start this construction, the state announced a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
In theory, it is a sum which will then enable SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source for contracts.
Today, at last, we come to the First Amendments.
The Rectification Finance Act of 2010, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms set up to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and an increase in the office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, as we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: 'The income from this interest is EUR 117 million per year'.
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists 'in order to modernise it, to increase the revenue generated from it and to affect the Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would it yield?
Mirage.
This is not quantified in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are added to the €4 billion of capital endowment to be mobilized by the state and injected into the Société du Grand Paris according to the project," can be read in the explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we generate revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then rake in to $4 billion, it explains."
"It will be budgeted and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will only be credited in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belongs to absent subscribers, risks triggering a rather lively parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Vengeful hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let's go in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about Berlusconi's sex life announce what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all but these two are Berlusconi's own), and the infamous caricature profile of Gaddafi has long been the subject of sketches for cabaret performers.
The rule that secret documents can only consist of known reports is fundamental to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Knights Templar or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who practice occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, and lazy (or narrow-minded) head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, an editor at the newspaper Libération), who considers to be true only what he admits.
The high-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the state department was the same that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why has there been so much fuss about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, which is that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War and since heads of state can talk on the phone or fly to dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have been transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer who watches films about the investigation knows very well that it is seemingly ignored out of hypocrisy alone.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly defames the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the most highly classified country in the world is a severe blow, not negligible, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "executors".
But let's move on from here to the deep truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, all power could be seized, like a Big Brother controlling the every move of its people.
Orvella's prophecy has been proven since the citizen became the absolute victim of the wreath of power thanks to the ability to control every movement with the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on.
But when we demonstrate, as it goes now, that even the "tombs" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of some hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as the citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets be maintained?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a true secret is a meaningless secret (and a meaningless secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, meaningless secret, because it is taken out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were meaningless secrets is to take away all power from him.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow inflicted on such a significant power?
Obviously, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be tantamount to publishing it on a poster posted on a street corner.
But it's also abundantly clear that with current technology, it's futile to hope that a message over the phone can be kept secret.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state traveled by plane and got in touch with one of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my forecast is science fiction and therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who travel discreetly through formalities along uncontrollable routes, carrying only the news they know by heart, or rather hiding precious information in the heel of their shoes.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in key-sealed drawers: by and large, the Watergate espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated the telegraph based on wires (telephone).
Videocassettes (analogue) allowed cinema lovers to shoot film step by step, moving it forward and backward and revealing all the secrets of montage, whereas now CDs (digital) allow only to jump chapters, that is, macro portions.
By high-speed trains, we can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while we need three and a half hours for the air journey and the transport that it includes.
So it is not uncommon for politics and communication techniques to return to horse-drawn carriages.
One last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was being plotted in the secret of the embassy.
Now it is the embassies that are demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test the promises of rapidly unblocked financing (called fast start or early financing) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were exposed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (or €420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU pulled out a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing fast start: a report detailing the action of its member states, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation priceless and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do it equally and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it mobilised €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to keep its pledge of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we pay attention to detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Accord to ensure that the increased burden is realised without prejudice to Public Assistance for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission took 2009 as a reference: international funding was preserved, and it added 150 million for three years of the Fast Start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or public assistance for development deadlines.
France, on the other hand, considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for Development d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries may remain constant (or even decrease), in order to keep its commitment to finance "new and additional"...
Another decisive element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as. France, they consider that 1€ borrowed equals 1€ donated.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission reduction, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present the one euro we receive as equivalent to the one euro we give... , we should not understand it in terms of our liabilities, but as the price of the loan to the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only give this justification: it is "kept" to its commitment of €420 million, of which 91.5% is a loan (€389.8 million) and 8.5% is donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use a loan on such a scale.
Germany has claimed 46% from there, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) keep their pledges with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 to satisfy its promise, France gives only 10 centimes and considers this effort comparable.
Beautiful juggling stunt!
To sum up, in its financing of the "fast start", France operates with a double trick: on the one hand, with the development of the stock over time, and on the other hand, with the real financial burden.
Although it spends only €36.1 million, it manages to convince itself that it is spending €420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
Manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would member states continue to donate when they only need to lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naïve...
The early financing chapter is only a small issue, a relatively short-term one, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France should announce a change in its accounting arrangements for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respecting its obligations and of fairness and fairness towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid a debate on long-term financing deposits (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or how loans are accounted for.
France should change its attitude in order to become as progressive on these deposits as it is on others.
So everyone is pinning their hopes on the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will be coming to Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to advance the discussions.
Alarm about pesticides ingested by children.
A ten-year-old child will one day ingest 81 different chemicals, according to one study published Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex-Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "do not have significant statistical value due to the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the issue being processed", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack for a child of about ten years old in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations — five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day — as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are clear carcinogens, as well as 37 that could interfere with internal secretion (PE) glands, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Center for Research on Cancer.
"While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we can clearly see in our research that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain about ten résidui with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya included in the lunch, where studies have found traces of powerful insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, beefsteak from minced meat, tuna in a can, and even a bun and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyzes revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of a plastic plate used to heat food in a microwave oven did not escape analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this 'cocktail of contaminants' is likely to be underestimated," the study concludes.
The Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) association has proposed establishing a moratorium on the use of pesticides "in the face of an emergency" in order to stop the "increase in lifestyle diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the presence status of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
