The great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was called to the NHL
Czech ice hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult time in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old fullback will be on the bench and could soon get into the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň or Russia's Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He took turns with Vegas at the exact halfway point of the game, and has not yet been introduced to the NHL rink since.
The incident occurred as the experienced goalkeeper moved from one pole to the other.
"The cavel the Frenchman will be out for approximately three to four weeks with an injury in the lower body," the Denver unit announced at the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL goal was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time, he was summoned from a farm, where he caught four duels and showed off his old form.
In the AHL, he made 94.5% of his interventions.
The full-time hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had a hip problem in his senior year and missed a single match in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL, "Francík" caught 36 games, his save rate at 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille's mask on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
As a Christmas card this year, Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also posted his wish, using a photograph of his husband Camille helping to put a mask on the veil.
This was reported on its website by the BBC, a British newswoman.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki, and Princess Charlotte also has a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, like the Princes George and Louis, shorts and a collar T-shirt.
Who took the photograph, William and Kate did not say, nor is it clear exactly when it was made.
Last year, the royal family for a photograph intended as a Christmas card posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The film, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, who is wearing a top hat and a mask on her face, helps Camille to put on her vewel in color, coalesided with a light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was to have a million crowns promised from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
It was reported by efotbal.cz, saying that it had accessed part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of directors of the Vicek club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red and white did not commit any corrupt conduct.
The site has published a transcript of police wiretaps, which mainly feature from Slavia by its former sporting director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
The former influential red-and-white official, according to the file, was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sporting director of the then second-tier Vyšehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
Criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia promised Berbro a financial reward for winning the title.
2019, SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to have a million-dollar bribe promised by the SK Slavia Prague officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file as saying.
A day later, according to the forensics, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors, Slavie Tvrdík.
The file no longer shows, according to the site, whether the police are still looking into this information.
Tvrdík rejected any corrupt conduct.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively sought to change our circumstances in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence the arbitrators in violation of the rules of fair play and have not given anyone any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told the Report List.
In the intercepts, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of Slavia's former dark-skinned players and also gossip about his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of allegedly influencing matches through referees was triggered by a police raid in several places last year, including the Prague headquarters of the FACR.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who is no longer in any of the football positions.
In mid-January, like the former sporting director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the Cold War.
The cannons will be new, but basically of the worse type (the scorers have to wear the armoured capsule and carry the cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armoured armoured vehicles - at a decent level, and the Praga V3S has already been disposed of by specialized units.
Airplanes: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, traffic - too small with a short range, but a modern one.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold-war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good numbers.
I have a story.
Chasing's next to town.
They were leaping nutria from the river and doing the damage to the crops, so I was sitting there.
As I came in, I saw that there was a fisherman on the side of the riverbank.
I didn't want to be a mess, so I sat down in peace and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before he came out, but of course the fox was in the way.
I let her come to the 40-yard man before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit his pants, waving a headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
Before I got off the sit-down, it was gone.
I. Even the meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a lot of coincidence to make something happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermal imaging that almost everyone has today.
So to see the spot, the expensive things get your noham data for the spacak, and you'd have the apartment fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamacek.
Internal Affairs has raised respirators considerably cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for purchasing and distributing robes, masks and respirators for professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks to acquire them.
iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day, the sums per respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did the awards move so dramatically?
Which authorities were economical?
And why did others buy the chore?
Lenka Kabrhel talks with the editor of iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I guess I am not affected by the memories of the ČSLA that the older generations have had), but the Czech Republic is unable to benefit from the compulsory military.
We don't even have large warehouses of technology to be able to grab the trainings, we don't actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is still more complicated, so the skills of reservists will rapidly lose out in time.
For this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to rehearse someone.
Finally, the reserve/territorial defence is of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where a mass guerrilla can be run, and it is also a spoken necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerilla will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography.
we don't have an individual skill.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them play like they had it.
It's a situation that you look like a dude who missed an empty gate two minutes ago, comes on the attack alone between 2 or even 3 hit and you're saying "tvl and what do you think is going to happen now?".
Well, of course they'll disobey him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this glassmaker's "blow up the defender" is so terrible that I find myself genuinely surprised to see that our striker was able to play one of the players' opponent.
First swallows
Covid's pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major turning point for the next few weeks.
The surge in hospitals according to the statistical models will last for some time, and a new unknown was added to the pandemic equation, as we know: the omikron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by the previous disease is helping against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side of the pluses also entered the covid's equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug has arrived in the Czech Republic, antivirals molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of the severe course of the disease and the associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And it should be supplemented soon by Pfizer's paxlovid drug, which reports a success rate of even 85 percent of the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding a portfolio of tools useful in the fight with the coronavir pandemic, highlighted the question of how prepared the administration is prepared for incoming drugs.
As has been said, the first to reach the domestic patients will be the Molnupiravir of Merck.
The company was the first to end up on the tape because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic began to begin to develop to find suitable treatment for the horse's viral disease on the South American continent.
These research is often neglected by the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking about "how our beak grew."
See, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most will tell you without any ado if not.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, to say this in public means losing work and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the polls, the west is good, east bad.
But they do find out what people think.
It is in France alone Le Pen and Zemmoura, both of whom are over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three after the Czech and quite identical.
Identical for the spinning of the units so that the soldiers don't have to re-learn where what is, so all objects are the same.
One is the Brdy Museum atom, and the other two are deserted.
The funny thing is that the sssr did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, whether for the sake of safety or the speed of the warhead deployment because of the more westerly position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only warheads were kept, not as entire missiles.
If this weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit arrived to retrieve the warhead and mounted it on some carrier.
In addition, the museum's maple, the rest are in a state of disrepair.
In the second grade of the elementary school we had a classmate of Cigán, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he showed up a lot, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone talked to him, went out often and wanted to explain something, missed a little, went to regular sports, did the sport with us, didn't steal snacks, or telephoned, he went to clean clothes.
He also went to outdoor schools, did various shenanigans, but he was fine, perhaps never a screw-up.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same class, another class.
Shortly there, they beat up a teacher, there were often dealt with by the police, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for an ad (old stuff, something I don't need etc) and I sold often to the Gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to draw me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like this, the guy called a month later to say he'd already rewritten it on himself.
I say of myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as he behaves in polite society (working, working, working, not hitting women, just ordinary behaviour).
But as someone comes in, reaching out, making out apartments and houses, having a mess around it, making trouble.. so it doesn't matter what color it is, but it's going to bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start doing business, working, learning the language (not necessarily, at least in English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs, too.
Young woman dies in car crash in Prachatick
"The young woman suffered significant multiple injuries and, despite the resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries at the scene," Zuzana Fajtlová, spokesperson for South Bohemian health rescuers, told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably travelling in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons as yet undetermined, went up on the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Skoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, the South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young Peugotu driver suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and remained wedged in the car.
After the rescue, he had to receive emergency pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the České Budějovice hospital, said the paramedic Fajtlová.
She said the man from the other car suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, with customers often not delivering data on them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly takes collector's cards.
"Usually it can be tens of dollars, from, say, ten dollars up, where it is still worthwhile to import, especially from Japan, where the post office is often free," the collector says.
The ordering of small consignments has become slightly more expensive since October, it must newly add VAT and pass the data to the post office to customs.
He receives an e-mail saying that customs officials are expecting the package to arrive.
It is then sufficient to fill in the details of the consignment and if the VAT was not included by the trader on sale, the customs office will charge him out of the total amount for the consignment and for the transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide the customs procedure itself, the total amount must also be credited to the remuneration of the haulier.
According to Lukáš Neuhel, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click on one or two of the clamp boxes, insert two attachments, and get done.
For me, it's usually a matter of five minutes, says Neuheisl.
But not all shipments manage to deliver smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad dropped from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for the delivery of the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments at the international post office that we have to process.
If people were to fill in all the data that is needed and fill them out in time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you suggest a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable about where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get a raise (who is an employee)?
I've been added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run on the job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the demonstrably convicted rapists are sent to prison for even six months?
This is just not the way I can't help it, how the court can only put an animal behind bars for 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
The 6 months are nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that a rape victim never has to recover from it either.
Will this not even deterricious future reporting of rape of the victims?
Man from the Tomb "rays" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Tomb inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He had summoned them to her himself.
He took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story about being robbed.
Officers arrived at the scene after calling 911 and were amazed when the alleged "colen" told them that he had made it all up for the officers to arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a notification to the Police of the Czech Republic.
A check on the identity of the man and his girlfriend then the officers discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide manhunt, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
The case is therefore being handled by the Police Code.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are no longer known as ethnically or culturally, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, the question is quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe anything quite without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not personally consider such a case as a true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there is an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, something like ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god should one then choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that there is at least one god in one of the thousands of religions who will punish you in a good way if you believe in the god of another.
But even in the Ten Commandments, there is no other god but Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more rational in such a case to refrain from believing in any god than to take the wrong choice from the thousands of gods, and the one real god I just missed will send me to hell or some similar place?
Other: Voluntary training followed by the reserve.
The Swiss model, I think, is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months for one) and under the command of pros with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a pro offer.
To all the components of the ACR, something like this would be useful.
It could be done in collaboration with the University of Defence.
We can speak like this: There is a constant tune-up cooperation between the education sector and the industry, companies hunt in schools and there is a kind of intermingling where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to the employment relationships.
Not only in adolescence, but this process takes place all the time, each of us is constantly learning something new, goes from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see this as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolia raider will never come here again.
​I find it funny how you think of NATO as something carved into stone, we have an ally, and they will defend us if there is trouble.
Oh, hello.
Just one election in the US that will cut down their budget and the whole of NATO is going to scratch.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that all they have to do is show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long worked as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population who can control the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled funds, so what the hell can't do.
We don't need a border fortifications, that's for the first time today, but the pimp teenager behind the long-distance remote-controlled device can cope.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
You unwrap the presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're home-growded with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of the shops has been created to welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
It is therefore a pity to treat them as a disposable waste.
Anyone can bring in the business involved after the agreement (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains nearly 150 of them) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small firms, reduce the amount of waste created, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome the packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market as well as the money saved, as the packaging carton has increased by 50 % over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filler material are brought to us in Popůvek u Brna by individuals who will accumulate at home, but we are also heard from companies with which we have arranged regular collections of deferred cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we form a more considerate world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopuheniníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz not only shows the sampling points for the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where you take the sorted waste from the home, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electro-suit, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, plus the reusable items find their second home.
The total project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
"Gradually, it is compelling yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPy and other places to help find use for things that would otherwise become waste unnecessarily," adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the app from the Clean Up the Czech Republic.
I find it rather wrong that these days the technique is so simple and stupid-resistant that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but learnt basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (especially in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of the files on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple Photos apps, or actually mobile phones generally just shine the text with the folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
They may have used technology since they were a child, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Ahead of the weekend, Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the streets – and mentioned so many actions that they could not be done in six months.
But that is how French politicians like it, and so do the voters.
Macron's backers straddling the right-left and left agree on little, but they do on Europe.
And in France, the new election of the head of state will be held in April.
The election calendar also influenced the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready to create the conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators rushed to criticize Macron's for being a pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, he is trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, Éric Zemmour, is now touring France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which colused with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite a success with the French.
Let's take Macron's idea seriously to one history book, and let's not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries are often learning history as a story we versus them and never as a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they will never know what the broader context of the event was.
The film of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mysh" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won the award for directing and for best actress, Yaeda Duričičová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary festival, he held the top rungs of the audience chart.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having flu/bean inch" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea in the flu.
(Only a personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it that way)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be published on 20 December, will include a traditional literary attachment.
And along with it, cultural tips will come out.
Those book ones, we are alsohering to you, subscribers, to this digital edition, so that you or have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.
Prosaic texts that follow the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of world observation and a description of everyday things with the remarkable poetic observational insight, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Sixer attempted to capture the essence of small town and Czech society.
A narrative about a return to the roots that turns out to be just a coveted illusion.
A Czech and a comparative woman carries a fairy tale about the Red Riding Hood to the backdrop of the contemporary village.
Her submission with brutality surpasses the folk versions and graduates in horror on the emotional emptiness.
And that the journey back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his penultimate novel, the author tells a rather less sentimental story of a return from emigration than we have become accustomed to hearing.
Those who remain, and those who left, know too little about themselves to make it a living together.
Trains start to run according to the new timetable, the carriers will be changed somewhere
From Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet is starting to run instead of ČD.
For most lines, the departure time is only adjusted, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to run an average of 6783 passenger services in the new timetable, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be on average in the new timetable.
Trains will run approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the national timetables, the runways will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares from next year, by an average of 3.2 per cent.
The tracks take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entry to the R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín line.
The carrier will be replaced by Czech Railways after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Every day, RegioJet will run a total of 16 services on the line, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has kept its 16 services, two return services to Slovakia, as well as a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, the carrier also tried to maintain the closest possible journey times of its long-distance trains despite the planned closure work.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be replaced on some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in Českolipsk, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use the uniform rail fares for the second year.
As with ČD, their price will be increased by inflationary 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Aren't we learning the other side's view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, toil, die.
I've never heard classes from the point of view of the slavers' side or from that time, no one defends this, just condemns it.
No one even tells you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by the blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought the land from the Indians, they just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, slaughtered them, while they were murders long ago.
I also spent some time in the US, right in the schools, both in the northern schools and in the Southern schools.
I have not encountered anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and, in my opinion, it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example in Japan, the atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was more that history wasn't black and white, and that we had a tendency to look at it from today's perspective, with no understanding.
History is not interested in anyone's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the point from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this again.
By the way, speaking of which we are with the Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they, too, had some of their good achievements and it seemed absurd to dismiss them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as a lot of people idealize it these days.
And a lot of people forget, too, that not everyone in the South was slavers, and a lot of things resented them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately skip some facts, they lie and manipulate, plus maybe our view doesn't exist with them (on YT's video was also on TV, where they turned out someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous at the US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealisation of communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, it seemed appalling at some universities, the students were pretty radicalized, and the schools supported them in it a lot of times.
And when I imagine that these people will be much older one day, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because among the young, he is and in the governing elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism had long since achieved what it had, and it was no longer about the same thing, radicalized.
Currently, feminists are referred to as feminists to those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as other groups themselves as LGBT, and it leads to radicalisation on the opposite side, often leading to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, finally, I didn't see anyone judging me for colonialism or slavery.
I was more likely to encounter bad geography, but it was a two-sided :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be useless in terms of some personal identity.
If something with people connects me to those people, that interests, views of the world and the experiences of the common experience, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak vicar is a very nice guy, he sermons more about theology than politics, but then he always chases some prickly about coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but they were actually born out of Catholic modernity and are effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to the Hussites at the service because it's theologically similar a lot, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michal's Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even masses in Latin every Sunday at 3 p.m., as they were done in front of the Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav – The flame ignited in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts didn't go to Vienna for him because of the pandemic of coronavirus, but this morning they took it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing.
It was also taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in with the section every year, I look forward to it too much.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, Girl Scout Amálie Budíková told the journalists.
While last year the handing took place at the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually for him, the scouts take the train to Vienna.
The distribution of the flame around the Czech Republic is unchanged.
With the Bethlehem Light, the Scouts traditionally took the train to Brno first, where they would hand it over to the diocesan bishop, Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent light delivery will be taken care of by Scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, travelling on selected fast trains as well as passenger trains.
From them, the light will be taken over in the stations by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame in the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not go.
This year, too, Scouts must comply with the measures in force against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going on like last year.
We are recommending both to the courier teams and to the organizers of local events to wear masks, to try to observe the spacing, as few as possible, not singing to colleagues, just behaving in such a way as to be as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the Bethlehem Lights event, Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
Bethlehem light is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, its spread has been taken care of by scouts and Girl Scouts for more than 30 years.
The event is built on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are cancer of the economy, but I don't think the subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education will make the money properly used, only I do not understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and companies overall.
As mentioned - it is produced by an unnecessary product and crashes into a free market and a "breed life of the company."
I work alone in a factory where a million boards are "comboxed to be "comgeted by the xy project" in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not support for a company that gives jobs to x people, this is a brake on the development where this company is holding up and taking orders/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Total approval, it's terrible.
Occasionally, even a man who was born in the Internet era also grabs in a trick or trap - especially commercials.
I think online ads don't budge me, but then I still get caught up in them that they influenced me, too - it's just so sophisticated that you can't always help it.
For this reason, too, I support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently want to give a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of a classics - I'd forbid the internsets.
I feel from this vira rous in (but predominantly in point 1):
1. "I'm not going to believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I'm not a sheep, but I'd rather believe in something that's less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it's important that I'll have my own original opinion that I'm going to claim it's a cover-up thinking"
"I'm not going to believe in everything the media says"
3. "I will not trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen for the trend of Christmas films, premiere in two hundred this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen for the Christmas film trend, with a record of more than two hundred for their viewers this year.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has scored well with audiences in recent years and is significantly increasing the audience, so more and more of these films are being produced.
This year, four times as many Christmas films have been made as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included in its sum only those images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in their name, so that in reality there will be much more festive films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, the films Home Alone, Love of Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom in the Christmas pictures was not launched until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark came up with a special film series, the BBC recalled.
Her Advent project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, this station began tuning its audience to the 22nd for Christmas. October and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed films on the agenda this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are making the overall contribution.
"The story doesn't matter that much in this magical period, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it's snowing," described this genre Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the audience, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the middle of all the festive madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray said.
For example, according to him, Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there's a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, is sorted out and the two are kissed.
This is how it goes on and on, and as long as all the films look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on the covid-19, he will not intervene in the final F1 race.
Only nineteen drivers will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive lyric on the covid-19 and will not intervene until the last race of the season.
The Haas stable will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was to attack a better 20th-place finish, which he went out in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepine of the Haas stable will not intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for the covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepine's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the last rung, will take to the track, the first of Max Verstappen to face Lewis Hamilton in a direct title battle.
Mazepin is relatively fine, according to Haas, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," its representatives said for the formulation1.com.
He will not send a replacement rider to the Haas race or be unable to.
A possible alternate would have to complete a qualification or a ride on another part of the weekend.
With the covidem of the-19s, the first competitor is not involved.
At the start of the season just ending, Kimi Räikkönen had a covid-19, and last year, the Sergio Pérez No, Lewis Hamilton, tested.
You can get arrested for this, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will impress!
He's a bit like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put in half a year of work and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our house sweaters never wore well," admits Leban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work over his work in six months.
He bought the Silk in Italy, a 24-carat gold thread in France, and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The base is wool and cotton, but the silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
"I'm completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could set off before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues protect the border with Belarus and build the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in the context of several months-long actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the Union border.
There are already British and Estonian soldiers on Polish territory.
Is the Omikron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygien is looking into another case of the child from Adamov.
"We are currently reported to have another suspected possibility of this option for another child from Adam, the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov Elementary School is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases appeared in the county in the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the option in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and the Nebuchadignee Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," the director said.
She added that they were two nurses from one of the departments of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two 11-year-old pupils of the Adamov Primary School.
There is no link between the cases from Brno and Adam.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic progresses.
No one with the suspicion of Omicron travelled abroad
None of these travelled abroad, nor any of their families, nor did there be contact with anyone who resided abroad.
The link with the water polo championship is none of those mentioned, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová said earlier that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno, was being tested in Brno a few weeks ago.
It also featured players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill after his return.
California will restrict the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
On Saturday, the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of some weapons in the most populous U.S. state, using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law after detecting the embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to damages in the lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsma's announcement responded to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court's opinion, which left the Texas abortion ban in force, even if it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent-setting verdict that set the right to abortion across the US until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court was now deciding not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issue that arises from the innovative construction of the measure.
In fact, the enforcement of the ban was brought to the public in this case, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to challenge him by the usual court.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision of the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported the Texas maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said.
"If states can now block the review of their laws by the federal courts, then California will use that power to protect people's lives," Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice, to work on a measure to entitle public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons are designated, which do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to seek damages of at least $10,000 (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who would produce, distribute, or sell assault rifles, components for "ghosten removals" or a set to produce them in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create the threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
The AP notes that California banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June, a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state did resume the ban now using a Texas template, the words of the liberal Supreme Court member, Sonia Sotomayor, who, in a disapproval of Friday's majority verdict, would be confirmed to have warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas Abortion ban a total immunity to judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue suing the selected officials of the southern US state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to what the vaccination schedule will look like and the vaccines themselves are also upgraded, based on the results.
For example, there is already a big study of the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, he'll have his vaccination schedule after a while, only it's too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on the inactivated virus, should come to the market shortly, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises to be more effective up to 10 times.

Poland threatens to stop payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it used new powers to stop the payment of money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw €36 billion from the EU's fund to rebuild the economies hit by the covidine pandemic-19.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism to take EU subsidies from countries violating the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU by veto on all matters that require uncommands," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidar Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which are leading to a drastic rise in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justifiable, given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the joint budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice Party.
According to the European Commission, the changes the Polish judiciary under Ziobro's tenure threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is building "impossible conditions because its aim is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw faces "a political dictate being blackmailed and an effort to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro also said.
He said that Poland should be a member of the EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accede to such concessions to Brussels, which would have resulted in Poland's sovereignty being curtailed.
"We will never agree to Poland having colony status," he said.
But to make sense of it... At Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt more than once, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes on the dairy shelves, and I asked.
They had it, it's true, in the narrow sector all the selected, less common and special cheeses were, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there's a no-brave, I'm not going to any more market, no more action, a golden shop in the square, maybe they don't have that kind of choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order of magnitude, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't give a damn anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data like manure be handled here, most vaccination opponents are only a little more out of the loop than most vaccination advocates.
While rational discussions are taking place at the professional level, only extreme views are being made to the public domain.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Forbid everything, allow everything.
Color cakes instead of sturdy analyses.

This state has it this way, and this is how we have it.
But that the data collection methodology is different in those two states, no one is addressing it.
Ugh, I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day for you all.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never because of the grades, mostly just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (reading instead to go to bed, fight with my brother etc).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mother always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after the next "journ" the spoon only brought and put it down so that I see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a few ass-inspinal blows (via the outfit).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and degree) is beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than the words.
The important thing, I think, is the warning part, because it gives the child a choice in his way to choose whether or not to listen or get better, and the punishment will not be.
In the end, I was usually only satisfied with a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When the eminent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, responded in 1999 to a journalistic inquiry into what the Czech Constitution meant to him – if the sacred charter to which he was swearing and learned about from school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which also define who we are as a state and its citizens, and to save them better with change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl gloated the question at the time.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing view among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
It has been tested for years by situations that its creators (which Vojtěch Cepl belonged to) could not have foreseen, for example with the conduct of the directly elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that the political interventions in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing the majority of the crises that society encounters across history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the constraints of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be exploited against minorities or individuals, so we are tying up with bans on politicians.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid doesn't choose, a baby of several months is fighting for the life of a baby in FN Brno
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder to children, there are also some difficult cases that hospitals have been facing mainly recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic of Children's Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic, told News.
The course is significantly simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the pediatric infectious disease clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently at the ARU.
Children with post-cannabis syndromes were in the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now there's an increase in children with acute covidic pneumonia, that is to say, pneumonia, which requires resuscitation beds," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and months of babies in addition to adults.
There are also children in hospitals in a severe condition due to coronavirus.
"At present, a child of several months and adolescent ages is in our country," said the chief surgeon.
He is pleased, however, that there have not yet been any child deaths on the coronavirus at the FN Brno hospital.
According to available data, the death of six children aged 0 to 14 in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominic, the children's hospital - not just in the coronacle ward - is an integral part of the psychologist's collaboration.
At the same time, it also points out that, as in adults, vaccination in children is aligned by the course of the disease, while at the same time reducing the incidence of post-party syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the application of the vaccine dose in children," the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map at mapy.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the rest area, you can walk anywhere (but don't climb over the fence into the field).
Skiing/driving/driving biking in the woods outside of marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course, it's not that much guard outside of national parks).
How does the conductor exercise?
Music is in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
It is weaned on the Liberec opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer, he can sing virtually all of his repertoire and, as a conductor, he works not only at the Liberec Theatre F. Šaldy, but also in Pilsen, at the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He collaborates with the Hradec Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic Orchestra or the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression of a controlled contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of mastered contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China has embarked on a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fueled criticism for failing to stop the contagion that had been transformed into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero addition to the infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping to fight the coronavirus, including Italy's worst-stricken ones.
How to perceive Beijing's willingness?
Is this about friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him: hey you don't want an elephant?
I've got it and it's awesome.
The wife likes to be saddled as she graze the grass, the car washes with the trunk, the kids play with it.
Just great.
If you want for 5,000, I'll sell you the elephant.
Friend: so yeah we'll slap each other, that's gonna be awesome...
After a while, they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant?????????
The lawned, the giant shit everywhere, the car got rid of it, the kids fought it out and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold says: you talk sickly about the elephant, you don't sell elephants like that...
The world's events are dominated by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international events.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works to integrate.
It has so far operated at the level of economic and political (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But perhaps in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will work.
It came to me, too, and it's very possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'm a quirk.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from a different commentary on "Spanish oranges and tangerines" when it is clear that these are both from Spain, whereas for the "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear for mandarins that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the phrase is “of all US forces” including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated on only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify this further with the US forces.
But again, even just a wordie-tale:D
Either way, it's a pointless request

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the monkey of the marmoship of Milly
The terrifying footage shows the moment the terrified monkey crouched in a toilet bowl before its heartless owner washed it away and laughed at it.
Holland also fed the monkey with sausages, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Municipal Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkeys' rehabilitation experts who cared for Mily after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened marmoset before.
Milly spent almost two years in rehab with Monkey World staff in Dorset and is now back on happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The mother-of-four confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was given a 12-week prison sentence at the Gwentteign, suspended for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was banned for life in animal husbandry and has to pay a cost of CZK 12,000 for legal costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue even further."
It took Milly to get used to the people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she'd met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, having settled down and being content with the male, the sight of new people can still cause them to panic.
The psychological scars of the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuses came to light after Gwent police discovered horrifying footage of the woman's phone in the woman's phone after a raid on drug charges.
The footage shows Milly swearing in a vulgar manner.
In the next video, Holland could be heard offering the monkey cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner, Russell Cox (43), pleaded guilty to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
Coke was found in her home for £1,600 (less than £50,000) hidden in Kinder's eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that prehistoric three times in a row when you bravely jump the whole 20th century?
Like, freshman year, you're gonna take the same things out of class six?
And it all kills the idea of cramming, where no one, the honor of the exceptions, doesn't care if you can or understand.
Just write the 1 test and then nobody cares about it.
Go and on the street, people are randomly asked if you can master the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority don't even scratch and tell you that they're totally fucked up.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the reality is that people do not want to and have no need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it in them anyway.
It's partly taught for the lot of people who need the one.
But like, the point of not really needing all this to stand by the machine, I was absolutely serious... ...because you just don't need it.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(What our communist past and the hunt against the educated and the elites are probably involved in this country) However, the price of being built by the barbarians at those machines is simply high.
If, say, journalists could count, the covid here would probably never have reached those dimensions.
Wedding at first sight: The War of Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea said on instagram in Stories, to inquisitive questions from curious fans, who were so disappointed in Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it had been creaking since the experiment began.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move out to see her, at least until he returned to Bohemia permanently.
She resolutely refused.
And, as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he fretted in return to Kadri in response to Andrea's allegations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty now was not even to his younger sister, Linda, who liked the ex-wife.
She decided to publicly stand up for her brother.
Normally, I don't comment on these things at all, and we've never said that much of this to each other in the family, either.
I certainly don't want to be a pity.
But when I see someone who tries to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, it just doesn't give me that!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to do this in this way to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most even though he was at a young age.
I'm all the more sorry to read such false information that's probably pretty taken out of context.
I would love to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and our family, stand in confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love and know the reality above all else, and we know how it really was, added vaguely.
The drunk thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what.
He began his robbery expedition by Cao in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually stole less than CZK 330 from one vehicle.
He then could think of nothing better than climbing up to the fifth floor and climbing into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A shot from one of the security cameras is then captured walking down the street from the scene of the crime, while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were and called the police.
She subsequently detained Cchaa.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed the money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is under investigation for now.
A drunk climbed up the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is limited in time and effectiveness bound to the pandemic emergency.
If that's repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law does restrict the scope of business
Isn't that a reason enough for you?
The right to assemble will be restricted, but not revoked.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think all of this people here is writing to you, you know.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to "hang."
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money it had to accumulate, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g. the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, for example, but the state and the church have no business together
The man went upside down from twelve meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
The incredible fall was survived on Sunday night by a man in Ostrava who was attended by rescuers from the Regional Medical Rescue Service.
The staff of the regional operations center took over the emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the man's fall from a height.
Two ZZS crews went to the scene immediately, medical and medical.
Upon arrival, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man was supposed to fall from a window from a height of about 12 meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vítkovice, coal was caught.
But not as much as it should, and the firefighters went into the action.
At the time of the arrival of the emergency services teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of his life.
The attending physician intubased his airway, secured artificial lung ventilation, and, after further measures in the pre-athospital emergency care, the ambulance vehicle transported him to the further care of the Ostrava trauma center, ZZS MS Region spokesman, Lukáš Humpl, informed.
I am more worried about the coronavirine that I am worried about inadequate reactions from the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic marks a challenge for politicians and officials, but the first line of the fight against the disease is mainly for doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends the belt
MMA has had a great gala full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, things were happening.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to beat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who failed to find a slayer for seven years.
Charles did not hesitate in the lightweight, and he performed a great strangle against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
His opponent was also defeated by Sean O'Malley.
Surprise the one no one expected.
It was the women's bantamweight match between the famed Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peña.
The American entered into a mutual battle as an imaginary "Dwarf," Nunes did not lose for seven years, gritting her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the start of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her quest for the victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick to the ground.
But Peňová did not be forced into any further error and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself using a lever for the hand.
The second round was riveting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents were treated with a lot of excellent punches and hardbacks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunes on the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up her effort and tap the attack.
The American thus gave everyone a huge shock when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, while Poirier did better, the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active, Oliveira, who tried to beat his opponent with a lever on his hand.
He didn't do too well, but then he put up a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and showered him with a series of shots.
It won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock the stranglehold.
The Brazilian thus defended the title, Poirier, on the other hand, lost after two years.
In the next game, Sean O'Malley, a sovereign triumph, scored a hard right-back on Raulian's side in the first round.
He then recharged him with a series of accurately targeted strokes and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes was celebrating another triumph with her infant daughter, now she has lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most of the essential names in Czech expresses only one grammatical genus, and it is therefore not difficult to determine whether they are male, female or medium.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns for which the family is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two houses.
When declensing, they then take on double endings and in some cases remain in a non-half-like form.
For example, the words "vague" or "the kingich" are both male and female, in the first one they are formed according to the model "machine", in the second according to the model "songwriter".
For another group of nouns, the shapes are already different in the first fall of the single number, such as: "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "bramboboa" (in the sense of a foodstuff).
Both shapes are literal, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "curk" in Bohemia and "eyescum" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unscripted, so are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "Přípkopa" and "trans-camp", "doughliha" and "coblich" etc.
Some of the words that entered into Czech from other languages were initially unhappressed, but they are gradually adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is both male and female, or the word "burt" which has remained unrelenting in the middle age, but has endings in the male one according to the model "crush."
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
There is tension at the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants attempting to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to travel to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise to support Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What actually motivates refugees to make an uncertain journey?
And what does the situation look like on the ground?
We haven't seen the blue sky in three months and we were choking, says the Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has been grappling with for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of acres of land.
How do the authorities there and the residents cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent drastic effects, as the critics say?
And what will the countries have to prepare for for the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to the Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
Fake accusations have always been and are pretty rare.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It's unpleasant for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, they're trying to book it.
I don't know anyone personally who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I've seen how these people are often treated by their people or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has happened to the victims finally opening up about their traumas.
But it's still kept to himself.
Yes, there are those who will falsely accuse someone.
It's gross and spat in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but spreading the idea that "a big part of the charge is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you only help sexual abusers.
Czech Republic flooded with houses built up, families with no money to finish
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have been in a precarious position for this.
It does not have the means to complete the family houses under construction, and the banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete the family houses under construction.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, creating extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move to houses under construction and under-rounded.
In the worse case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay the rent," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three family houses in a year, and for 50 percent, that's what happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are yet to have financial problems.
If they figured the house would cost them five million, now it's going to cost them seven.
I think some of them will be waiting," Slivoň added.
The most expensive was copper, iron, and plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of the construction industries are missing and the influx of foreign workers is being hampered by pandemics.
More favourable at the moment is only the situation regarding the issuance of the building permit.
"The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're doing well and we'll be even better off.
But real visions are missing, says ČJD - mujRozhlas
In addition to the classic celebrations, the entry to the new year was traditionally accompanied by the speeches of politicians.
This year, in addition to the prime minister and ANO President Andrej Babiš, the president of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, spoke to the nation, as well as the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.
What fundamental have we learned?
As in this I find the thesis super just, I have my own theme, which I choose, I follow the bachelor's degree, I always work on it all year round and then in a week or two I write down the written part.
The statesmen are completely at peace with us, if you're not a total macaque and something's left in that head, then the board won't be choking on the theory.
For example, I'd been a statebug a week, and when I was at my end, the board always tried to guide me on some logical derivation that came right in and I had it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it a lot of times, really beneficial, they teach it a lot) and then they just learn the project and get them set.
I think it's cool when at the end of the subject there's a test that reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defence.
All the ok, however, don't overwhelm emails and phones and send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same prick as them.
Those people at the embassy don't have to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a big risk, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something might happen to them.
But you might as well build a similar statue of Putin next to the Pooh bear statue.
You might want to give it to touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws a sticky sticks for artists.
As soon as you don't give the stories every day and a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to the bare minimum.
In addition, they still change what function is more important, like, comment or deposit.
I've been so screwed up lately, so I may have to stoop to the ticku, where a lot of artists in my business are a success and they're almost indulging in it.
Finally, I might even like to see something user-priced come along that doesn't suck up all the creativity and energy from the artists
Statement by the Workers' Party on Donbass
The union – yes, the breakage - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
In the Belgrade Forest on 8 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and violations of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open lenient stance of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the SSR union as an entity of international law and, as a geopolitical reality, ceases to exist."
With one cut of the pen, they "cancelled" a huge country with a population of nearly three hundred million.
The collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by between ten and eleven million.
Even without regard to the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who, in one session in the Belgrade Forest, destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years, had betrayed the socialist camp (a created price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialisation, put the brakes on agriculture, tore away from the world's largest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, the slice of science, the growth of criminality, the interethnic conflict, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of Olomouc revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all the result of the geopolitical surrender, the surrender of the socialist camp first, and then the Soviet Union.
There is such a concept in political science as a "vacuum of force."
Everything that was betrayed and given up in haste quickly filled and captured the countries of NATO, which adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken to this day mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of the product sold in the supermarket with a large turnover does not have to correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs £189/kg.
I'll buy it with me putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will make it cheaper for CZK 99 / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by changing the meat to become a burden for my digestive system?
Or will I wait until Thursday and the meat will be reduced to £69 / kg 1 day before the expiration date - what makes this meat different from what I bought on Monday for £120 for more and leave it for 3 days in his fridge?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
These crap about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, rotten or poor quality are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now recently I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out a brochure, I always take such things to help the part-time workers, they can't fire it...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views of how the world works, but there's nothing about God, I was confused, but I had a hunch that it would be some kind of agitator.
After reading, I found who was releasing it, and finally, Scientology came out.
Well, like he was a good stuffy, full of completely useless lectures, like I'm supposed to wash up and not be a pussy.
Pity of paper, this would not make the forests cut down.
I've been through something like this with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you accommodate the man because you like him without you realizing how much of the situation is.
She threatened me several times for hurting me for hurting me for going out with a friend she didn't like to go out to chat.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and on her knees begging me not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
Approximately a year it was a super relationship but then another six-month run and started to get her nuts.
Then I ended the relationship with the one I said I'd broken up and lied to her, but we could talk about it again next week to calm her down and not run amok again.
Such a man will suck the feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies are being frantically stolen here by buying a cloud of tests and a hunt for the positive, who wouldn't even know about the terrible illness if it weren't for the test.
All we achieve is a complication for companies, carriers and more, because their employees in the random number generator were given five days of house arrest.
They had stopped the sham in the west, acknowledging that it was not worth addressing the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and has to steal some more and drive your ego by making up with the buggery.
I see we're getting back from a good old-fashioned son of a bitch.
After several years of downturn and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruitment is once again returning to the limelight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at the university), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly flipped to "that's not to be of interest to you, just get people."
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer, as I wanted to help people, however, the training was more to scare and talk you down.
When the first money you earned came in, you quickly realized that if you wanted to make a profit, you had to whine a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so you felt like a door-to-door pot dealer.
But what can I say, experience was valuable, you learned that you should not jump on every bandwagon and check the information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't lump everyone in the same bag.
People are successful in this business and even good for people, but they will certainly not brag about expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
In the corporation where I do, I haven't seen much of this stuff.
HR is at ease, the managers are minding their management and don't really poop our noses.
The regular evaluation is kind of happening, in the form in which it goes with us quite well (set up some goals for the next year, in a year we look at what came out and what it didn't) - it's more self-assessment than judging you by someone judging by some numbers, that sort of thing.
Corporate events also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - departments that are more "corporate."
Sometimes you get the feeling that we're such a near-startup who squats in the offices of a big corporation, well.
But it works that way they don't annoy us much while the results are.
The Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched fruitlessly for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the minister of foreign affairs in the resignation, Jakub Kulhánek, announced on social networks that the woman from Uherskohradištsk had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed to our embassy in London this afternoon that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose more information on the case.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on the bus on the way home from work, before boarding she was still to collect money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, with Interpol placing her among the missing from the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police had already detained a man in this connection a few days earlier.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what she suspects, but she did not disclose it.
In four municipalities, new councils were made at the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, in the municipalities of Komňa in Uherskohradišťsko, Lusatia in Most, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovná na Pelhřimovsku, the new councils were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils here fell apart.
The 28 seats were bidding for 99 valid candidates in the new election.

The 28 representative posts were attended by 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidates was 46.6.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year.
It hosted four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, the highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more challenging epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and staffing, assessed Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12, at 3:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we have a fairly dangerous, infecting illness, at the very beginning, but it went without much of a hitchhiking.
To deal with the idiotic part of the population on all its strata, I have a problem with that until now.
I'm most looking forward to vaccinations (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people are not assholes.
He would be stripped of his presidency and regained his capacity.
The chance that this will really happen is, however, as the others here mention very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure the scrapped file would even be considered treason.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic will threaten sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic affected intimate life: The number of people under 35, who is without sex, is growing for a year
More and more young adults in the US are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious-based people, the DailyMail website reports.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people younger than 35, who renounce their sex life, rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35, who said they did not have intercourse in the last year, were more numerous than ever.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One may be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks, or video games that make sex a minor and lesser priority for young people could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35, who states that they have not had sex in the previous year," said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more common in people in the marriage, with only 5% of them saying they had been without sex in the last year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 3wine are only a small percentage.
The decline in sexual activity is also helped by fear of marital intercourse and religious background.
Although the spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35.
Young people are divided by opinion of premarital sex, about 30% consider it a bad thing, while about 70% think he's fine.
"It is true that they are a minority among the free individuals in this age group, but their behavior is pushing this trend," Stone says of these thirty percent.
For most of those with a moral problem with pre-marital intercourse, the reason for is religious foundations.
Since 2008, the ratio of abstinence to single people under the age of 35, who attend religious gatherings more than once a month, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to close to 60%.
Among the "less believers," the trend has risen from 10% to 20%," Stone said.
The decline in sexual activity is also contributed by other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is less in people without work, or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus "replacing" this need.
This trend caught on mainly behind the lockdown at the time of the koronavir pandemic.
The whole ordering of vaccination against the covid is about whether society should force a part of the population into behavior that they do not want but that can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that personally interests me most about the issue of social conscience.
I.e. the question, for example, whether if we don't order it for them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we would certainly be responsible for the deaths of an 80-year-old man who didn't really know very well, we didn't explain it to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he couldn't be inoculated, and he finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think we are to blame for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and a totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the KSČ.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear to suggest that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the other group, so they will actually be able to blame for it.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will a mild winter affect the fight against drought?
This winter has so far brought one of the smallest snowpacks in the Czech Republic in recent times.
Ski resort operators can't do without any technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizera Fift running.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean to fight drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have one story, but it's not about the master-keeper.
Once, in high school, the teacher ran us across the city to the boathouse so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there we went down this quite wide street and who we don't see in the middle - the followers of the sect Hare Krishna.
Of course, they fell on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but he and a friend got talking.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she had said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
We all, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We're very spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
The new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter in the relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must jointly signal that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis, triggered by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border, is, according to the chancellor, to be addressed by diplomatic negotiations, including within the "Normandy Group," associating France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, had artificially triggered the migration crisis and was using people as living targets and a weapon, because night after night we are recording a hundred attempts to (illegal) crossings of the border.
He and the chancellor discussed further sanctions to finally understand the Kremlin's Lukashenko regime and his patrons in the Kremlin that we were determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in its dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime with the refugees.
Drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to conceal it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was already being driven by another nun, who was trying to take the blame.
When officers told her that even so, she was to be responsible for not giving priority in the drive and driving away from the scene of the accident to lose her driver's license, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had hit the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police then came for Sister Celestina.
They gave her a breath test, and after discovering she had over two per mille in her blood, she was immediately revoked by her driver's license.
At the same time, they informed her that she would plead guilty to her actions in court.
Hugo's dog is doing its best.
Juraj Šajmovic, however, did not take care of his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen themselves in American stories about canine pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of the film's craft.
After the kitsch film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people to live, the next film here is now outgoing about the audience's emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., is loosely following up on his previous film Here I Watch for I Watch.
The dachshund Hugo and some familiar figures around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guesthouse, which is dying, and so the dog walkers, Julia's father and her partner and especially her daughter Veronika, start to invite him.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who is having her first love.
The director and partner Beatriz Šimmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had been grappling with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but there at least the children and the dog were entertained.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that evokes a mixture of ailments and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's get this summary.
Julie, though a scientist, succumbs to the obscurant delusions in his desire for a child, and when the right "constellation" arrives, copulates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are currently determined - on the hood of a car or church tower (especially during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forest, who falls into a coma, before the family is taken from the hospital by the family to avoid the smell of the smell in his heart of his heart.The solitude could have been played out by the miraculous process of recovery by the dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the strength of the pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer marvels at the content of the content pelmel full of implausible situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of female thieves from the staff, a dog-walker competition, a Šumava charlatan, the cops arriving to report for "drugs" and discussing over herbs about the fertilizer strength of the bone meal - and which the baked-in family in the guesthouse will of course get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits on paired and made up with a cigarette at the family table and demands on his father's whiskey and slabs as a healed vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of that, the creator will explain to the viewer that "this happens sometime after the coma."
Shayman's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of the text's work, the ability to build the load-bearing situations, the feeling for the characters' characters as well as the punch line and the direction.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut clueless and the overall impression is grimy.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their parties, they have little to play.
The film's only plus mark is the poetic footage of the Šumava nature of the cameraman, Vladimír Holomko, and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to draw out a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog's catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar terms the characters are making.
The argument is not even the years-long membership of the Dachshund Breeders' Club - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote one's nature and friendship with the dog, the knowledge of the craft must also be for one to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family shot, there's a little too erotic and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an ad for canisterapy, this amateurish-concluded piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant swearing-in from dicks like you.
There's a difference between offering and compulsion, here you can see how you don't understand it, but that's only because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to kidas like that all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in it, a job on earner.
The Middle East is plagued by the unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time in the year it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we noted at some stations, is unusual," confirms the Israeli Meteorological Service.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average in November.
This week's two-day rain was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained for long.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced Nazareth resident Wasim Ask.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, bumpy and irregular.
The forests depend on the winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about the supply of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel's largest freshwater source, Lake of Galilee, was filled to the brim with three of the last rainy winters this spring.
Since then, the level has been dropping.
Water managers warned of the drought a long time ago.
"It is to be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be fewer rainfall," according to Israel's Water Authority spokeswoman Uri Schor in 2018.
Israel can help with technology such as desalination or recycling of wastewater.
It is worse for economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are more tank trucks.
Water pipes and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have gone up seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years," the driver of the gypsy car, Imad Sulejman, reported in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The trough of the local river was without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the negotiations in Vienna had not produced "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the US, is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also reported Washington on military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said nuclear negotiations in Vienna had not produced "no progress" and world powers "meaning that Iranians are messing with them."
About three years ago, this happened to me, too.
I lectured the lady a little and barbecued in the interview to find out what he wanted me to do.
Finally, I discovered that my suspicions of the pyramid were justified.
Since I really don't like these scams, I took a little more trouble with the lady in doubt and questions, and finally thanked and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major surge of skiing enthusiasts this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operations as a result.
The downhill racers were not deterred by the obligation to show themselves at the lifts with a covidid certificate.
While toffilers do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people set out for the cross-country stop and on the slopes in the Liberec Region at the weekend.
The skiers were happy with the weather, which was offered by the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
"We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out from that evening skiing on Friday, when we had the first skiers on the hill," said the director of the Ještěd Sports Complex, Jakub Hanuš.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend skiing this weekend.
For example, the Ski Aréna Karlov or a resort in Branná on Šumpersk were open.
The weekend attendance was very decent, with an estimated 400 people arriving on Saturday and today.
The conditions are awesome.
The sun was shining today, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect one, he did not spare praise the representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell a ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are sick and expected to be covid-19 after undergoing.
With few exceptions, people are prepared for this and are shown with the necessary documents, René Hroneš of the Špindlerův Mlýn skicenter told the Czech Press Agency.
"We only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Lower interest than in front of the pandemic is reported by some rental and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It's not like in the past years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava store in Opava.
He expects a greater surge in the skiing period.
The director of the King's Snowbear Society, David Shinták, also feels that because of the covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time, before the pandemic, we were almost lent.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Shinták told the Czech Press Agency.
People, he said, were lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental company in the Novako area on Božíěj Dar is seeing a lot of demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and buyers must now order them in advance.
"We are starting to lend the runners this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year," said Pavlína Nováková, the site's operator.
Interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality of life here as they do abroad.
This is certainly not part of the socialist health service, where it is often impossible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There are smart and skilled people going abroad who have no assets here.
The owner of the company doesn't go abroad really.
The rest, however, was completely agreed.
If these people don't live well in the Czech Republic and if these people don't have a vision of a sensible future in the Czech Republic, they just won't live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, the year of reign, and suddenly the one-year emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position on a day-to-day basis.
The next question is the election at all.
If you live here sick, there's also a traditional V4k lunatic who can win.
The young and the educated will leave, with his supporters and people whose assets cannot be shipped on the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmajer in his blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the crew of the film The Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), was enjoying the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied face photo on social media.
Is this a real injury, or is it a makeup for the set?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on the way home.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are becoming very concerned about her," Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncova worked in Saturday's video said.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her, too, and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech, according to her, left work at about 19:45 on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her co-workers on 3 December.
According to British media, Srncová served as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is owned by the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We'd like to urge anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police," the memo went on.
The public is also called for cooperation by MEP Harriet Harman, who drew the attention of Srncova's case at a press conference on Saturday.
"She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, worried to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel like we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service," Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
This is not how I underestimate Ukraine.
These are not "huge amounts" but ca 8 percent of the Russian military.
You will notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the Invasion and is getting fed up with our entry.
I was quoting upstairs.
I don't know what he decided Russia wanted to war on.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has the GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in '38 is off the table on so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare this to the First of the Pristice War and the "Sanex" of the Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to honour the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing the ridiculous republics.
That's about it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be consistent with.
It, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are awaiting several changes from Sunday, mainly on suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others were lost.
The integrated system is newly involved in Mladá Boleslav.
In the capital from Sunday, the express trains from České Budějovice have been stopping at the Garden City station.
In suburban train transport, the S7 trains will depart, passing through Prague's main station on the route from Beroun to Český Brod.
The recently commissioned station Praha-Zhradní Město will be newly stopped by the R17 train from České Budějovice and Benešov.
PID will be newly expanded to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go all the way to Světlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavů and Turnov.
Buses in Mladá Boleslav will be included, including lines with an extension to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
The integration will abolish 77 routes, 37 new routes will be introduced and operations will be modified to the 12 operating.
From Prague's Zličín will be the new bus line 405, which will go all the way to Žatec.
There was also a new direct connection Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
The skiment at the morning peak and on the weekend will be strengthened from Prague to Rakovník, when the express number 404 will be newly launched.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 coming to the Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They leave the Střížkov metro station, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Novy Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The 410 additional line runs through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the new operation on a dozen Central Bohemian local lines, including Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšín, are cancelled or restricted.
All trains with departure from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue.
Changes are also awaiting passengers in other places.
Buses are replacing some of the cancelled rail lines or the section on line 420 from Dobříš is being extended with a link from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsko.
The changes were made to the routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk and the routes of some buses at the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region are modified.
Healthy snack/salarm to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm a classic 9-5 with a break of 30min, and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further up to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I don't have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietarily as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and at speed I buy at speed at the most pizza buns and yoghurt and apple for a snack.
Q: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend to me to buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, that's how it is.
And it's not the trees you must necessarily see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason why we're forbidden to go off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Confessions of Dary on the relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech showbiz pond has lived with nothing more than to unveil the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been pulling it together since the summer, the famous footballer even getting a divorce for the singer.
Dara has now sent a wide-ranging message to fans explaining why she hid her love from them for a long six months.
"I would like to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who miss that Dara was caught by a beard, I mean, sorry, Nedvěd," jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But he said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus, and while they are accustomed to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here it is.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who don't care about it at all and it's leaking on them from the can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
It's as if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend were right for each other, or you insisted that they really all know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's the bout, you want to, it's Dara's mind.
The pair got together in Italy, where the Rolins went to prepare for their new fashion collection.
Nedvěd, for his part, has long served as the vice-president of the football club Juventus.
They only came out with the truth now, as they waited for the conclusion of Nedved's divorce.
He and his wife, Ivana, had been separated for three years, but they have not been paper-based for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, thank you.
We are only human, we have families, children, history and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
So I love my new husband, and like him with me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hey, the other commentators have probably already said everything important, I'm just confirming that the dorms are cool to start, my classmates mostly met and became friends during the first semester or two, and then found the suits together, which seems like the best option to me, because you know who you're going to live with.
The flats are usually not advertised very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but it certainly doesn't hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (a street like Vranovská, French, etc., that is a rather poor address), and some parts of the Jewels are a bit of a ghetto.
In contrast, the neighborhood of Veveří is very student, the King's Field and that's fine in that direction, except it's close to most of the Faculty of BUT (I don't know exactly where you're getting on).
I have never been looking for rent, but I am a native Brňák, so I can possibly give advice with Brno as such, if you still miss some information :)
But this is an example of completely "normal" reasoning.
In fact, because of what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is quite right that the state does not sufficiently fund some schools.
Either they teach what they want and pay for it out of their own business or go according to the state and pay for it.
After all, we cannot let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he will throw in a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution, and because of that, he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses its weight somewhat when it is written by a man who, two days before, had spoken out in this way about the petition for boycotting a totalitarian state:
So the voice against whether someone goes to an abortion is as much for you as the voice against a statue standing in the square?
I'd consult with you directly with the man who was handing you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in the cataloguing/digitization that (even longtime professionals) they'd either throw it off the eye or write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (associated in the convention) and the remark that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I'd deal with it in a touch, depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and striving student, you can look at some sign databases and look for the closest ones.
But since it looks like you're drawing on a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own emblem, which fits with what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more of the Oder Empire (kingalistic) than OdryNská?
PSS: someone's already cracked it for you.
Check out the comment with ΦθΛH
Politicians have no idea what the 'them' will be' for the 'them' of our Presidency.
This is a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea of approving anything because no one understood any text is amusing.
All the important documents approved are examined word for word, that's not enough for a basic knowledge of English anyway, that's a matter for the lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, and English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, to establish above-standard relationships.
In addition to the English, it's quite interesting, after the performance of GB from the EU.
I don't get the hate on Ceye.
I've been working there for the third year and totally fine.
How many times do I come from work at 10 p.m. and never have a problem.
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who has barely set foot there in his life.
Yeah, the majority of Brno's Romani population lives there, but all they do is get in the way of the sidewalk and park where they don't have:D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb out into the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively inexpensive housing with good accessibility to the center, I'd go for it.
A lot of flats are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and lover Gelem as a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to set on fire.
I have seen the Dades of the Wreath, and I'm sure Lucie has one, said the Blitz saxophonist, who confirmed to Patras's words that he often visited it.
She visits, but does not live in their home in Vinohrady, where Dade was left alone after his departure.
Slováček still doesn't know where he's going to be on Christmas Eve.
We met with Annie, Felix and both grandsons recently.
Video: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm going to be.
I buy the gifts continuously and I will definitely buy Dade and Lucia something, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music music video for the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel myself.
I will always find someone with whom I like to have fun, says Slováček, who was glad to meet the wife of Luďk Soboty Adriana or the singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made that clear.
And we are Iceland to be able to afford not to have both soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that someone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough for the aggressor to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't see, why would that be a bad argument, then explain that to me?
I don't know of any other file that could be deployed in a crisis in hospitals.
There are few Cops, and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else is such a high percentage of medically trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just the Obora is on the heads of the previous governments, not the military, they are asking for new toys for quite a while.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just supposed to be a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst dry season in years.
Water, according to scientists, has decreased in mountain and foothill areas, with smaller rainfall recorded by places where there has been no shortage of moisture before.
The cause of the drought in much of central Europe is climate change.
But the effects are also compounded by the way we run the land.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's the way it's going to be, as soon as I can skate on the ice, I don't know what it's to play hockey, and the tactic (what I tried to do at the Franchise Hockey Manager) is also generally a halter.
And whether you're a hockey team called "Survey Russia" or "the "allows China" so lose by two goals even if you don't have to win a game at all costs is different than when it's leveled.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who tick out, what the judges notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's about all the sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or the F1, WRC motorsport, etc.
controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around it is as it always is, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would have been a classic "at the year they lost" vs. "We won."
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily outbreaks.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are at 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of outbreaks in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It's the lowest daily number from 13. October.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain faces a 'unavoidable' major wave of contagion caused by Omikron, dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical consultancy for the British Health Security Administration.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects the number to rise.
No one has died of omikron yet, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the annex.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer noted on Sunday that Boris Johnson appeared to have broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government secretary defended the quiz being made "virtually" through a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
There is growing pressure in Britain to remove Johnson from the premiership.
Last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdownu.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial ITV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly the events developed.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orbán's 12-year-old government.
It will be an election of pan-European significance.
How much is it to expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because there hasn't been a last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other minor or bigger tricks.
The last one so far is that everyone can in practice choose where they want to.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from the decided districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is markedly different.
It used to be a question, not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if he would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that a unified opposition will win more votes and mandates.
This is a big no-brainer for Viktor Orbán and his side.
Won't they be more tougher in an effort to keep playing too hard?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the Speaker of the Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kövér, was leaked to independent media, where he tells the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are those the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my parents' parents are not very patient, neither do I, Daddy has it for a long time, but then he hits extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and fumed like a little girl, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and it was all blue, that's what they took me out of the shower for about two times to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me with education, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things by force now, I was quite a fight as a child, now I'll hit something for a discharge, and as a younger one, I might have slapped my parents' hands like that (so I don't get too much of a mouthful), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge to do it.
I'm not able to determine to what extent my explosiveness is, but I'm sure the upbringing has a part to do that, too.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids, too, and to deal with it the same.
I think hitting the kids is just wrong and my parents shouldn't have done it, especially at the time when it wasn't "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up, it's probably not possible for my kids not to get a little bit of a rain on, so I don't blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of anything.
The laws are supposed to be clear and unequivocal.
Kundami, then, would call those who make up the law of such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of an income shortfall?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product, and you'll get what mortgage you'll get paid for?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of journalist Kuciak's killers?
In Slovakia, the trial begins in the trial of the four accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner was changed by Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and the judiciary.
How major a break will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is hugely caused by the press.
How is it possible that this petition had orders of magnitude more media attention than the repetition of the deans of all the medical faculties that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled, and the company took the brunt of it.
Czech television was dying with covid just six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of repositories nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš's government is over, and the law to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected in the selection and authorisation of a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Government Legislative Council interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which was submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the concerned municipalities associated in the Platform against the Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-administration expects the law to strengthen their capabilities in deciding the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The bill by Minister Karel Havlíček, who has the Platform's disposal, is mainly criticized by municipalities: the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding the selection of the site for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be really effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation on the reticlosing administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before the specific proceedings are initiated.
The draft of the substantive intention is almost completely omits public involvement and makes municipal citizens practically mere statisticians in the authorisation procedures.
The proposal lacks a system compensation setting for municipalities for the entire process of loccoring and selecting the site for the repository, permitting and operation.
Municipal leaders, according to today's legal norms, do not have much of a choice to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a spot for a repository.
Only in some authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or be revoked, but the authority or the Minister in whose interest it is the authorisation is to be issued decides.
Any action does not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of exploratory or construction works.
The co-decision of self-government requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting the repository, as in Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is, beyond that, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by SÚRAO and following on from the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total sum for these works is expected to be almost CZK 4 million, according to the contract register.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and a spokesman for the Platform Against the Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who have only postponed the settlement of the position of the municipalities vis-à-vis state offices in the search for a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for the support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in a similar way as the directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against the deep-sea repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-sea storage.
The platform further advocates that the decision to select a site for possible storage should be conditional on the prior approval of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight with fear: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for years, he was eventually terrified by the doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fatty of the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family had begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing the furniture to crack.
"I put it all in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, practice.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit in place anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and what you want to use the word "boss."
If it's any text on a platform that's expecting readers from a gaming background, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were, say, a formal text and, say, a college text, I'd be looking for a look at how to describe or explain the boss.
On top of that, there are more kinds of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses, right, and so is a "boss" something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games hidden are the stabled boss (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all needed to beat the game or level to be completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player doesn't directly run out with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they're something to call them that?
Well, then there are mini bosses.
It is a one-word-sword-like fact that the boss is probably just not even possible, Czech and other languages don't sort of deal with it (it's just Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent), is interesting.
It is, in short, a major, computer-controlled, computer-controlled game, an opponent stronger than all the previous ones and watching the completion of some level or task.
The missing Petra from London is being searched for by the world.
Czech police were also involved.
The missing Petra Srncova has been wanted by British police since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradišťsko has been searching since 7 December.
At the same time, Interpol is assisting the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since 3 December.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
So the whole world is searching for Petra.
"Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We share information on the case together," she added.
The announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimetres tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradišťsko.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such a disappearance is very unusual for her
The search for Petra was also involved with the country's MP, Harriet Harman.
She was involved in the posting of flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police officers have already detained one of the suspects.
But it is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Petra.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While data in October pointed to a slight drop in offensive campaigns, last month, as the end of the year approaches, the attacks intensified significantly.
We saw the big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract attention in the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was designated as a copy of the receipt repairs for 11.2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code is actively searched for by the stored login details, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the holidays approaching and at the end of the year, the attackers' activity is growing again.
In November, spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured more of a global reach campaigns.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but remains behind nearly a fifth of all detection.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3rd, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook most often included an attachment with the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The appendix in Czech can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and damping of activity is registered by security analysts at the Fareit program, which was worth 1.6 percent of the attacks and has not had a major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic for the last few months.

The procession through Prague was larger than the media reports.
According to the footage of the waterfront procession and in my experience, the demonstrator is not afraid of an estimate of around 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite embankment road.
That means people are really a lot.
The parade of about 4,000 demonstrators is spontaneously joined by an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Wet.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or sections of the population led to finding common ground.
Only the anti-victors, anti-waiters and company themselves would be unable to fulfill or pay for the procession this big.
Events of the Society of the Church of the Dog Association are in percent popularity, it reminds me of a Million Moments for Paradise.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technology.
It's hard to say what movement could be bribed out of this discontent, depending not only on the money supply, but also on whether Pfizer's three-dose vaccine becomes a quad or more dosage.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or a centrist movement, you bet.
The triple vaccine will almost certainly become multi-dose, because it is obvious that we will have to be reoccucted every six months.
I am very glad that the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant actions of scientists, to which humanity is rightly aloof.
End of the tail, Bulgaria has a new premiere preaching change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked the formation of the new government of Kirila Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition to take office in a few days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the last government lost the election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties blaming the fight against bribery and the abuse of power were unable to reach an agreement, so there were two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one's watching?
The "secret" footage of the footage is a global hit.
In Britain, concerns grew over the weekend about the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she drove home to the south of the British metropolis from work.
In addition to the police, information about the children's worker is also being called for by the police to her previous employer or MP representing part of London, where she lived.
"The disappearance of Petra is nothing like her behavior and we are becoming very concerned about her," Lucy O'Connor of the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncova worked in Saturday's video said.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her, too, and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech, according to her, left work at about 19:45 on Sunday, November 28 and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her co-workers on 3 December.
According to British media, Srncová served as an "assistant to nurses" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is owned by the hospital association Guy's and St Thomas.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group of health facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We'd like to urge anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police," the memo went on.
Šumperská amateur children's room painter Zdenek Dvořáková Kocourková (as well as the regional Pirate Councillor) was given anonymous by his paintings of pleading with the copyright.

In Ústí nad Labem, the moon was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred to the complaint to the RMD, which owns the roads, and because it was said to have not responded, the hole passed.
Eventually, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RMD began to "intentionally address the situation."
