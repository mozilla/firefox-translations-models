Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of who would hurt him, adding, "He's finally started doing well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
San Francisco's police department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim's Louis Galicia's brother told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, had earned his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and grief are of Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had first slept in the hostels, but that "he had finally started to do well."
“He found an apartment, dated a girl,” Louis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of who would have wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us a meal, he made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any argument.
He was a brother who took things for the way they are.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the uncuttered diamond he lit up every day," he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in vehicle upgrades.
They have air conditioning as well as new toilets.
In the last six years, the state-owned carrier has invested over CZK 31bn in the modernization of the vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new system of closed toilets.
Amounts for the modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles over the last six years.
A third of the wagons are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new closed toilet system.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age of two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic carriages.
A larger share of the investment was given to the carrier in regional transport, where roughly 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent was invested by the company to restore long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
But the upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of the driving vehicles of ČD would increase by ten years.
A little older, on average, are passenger carriages, whose average age, when the upgrades are worthwhile, is 23.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic sets made up of wagons and pulled by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motorised or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives fell from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic carriages dropped from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was particularly disposing of old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments planned for the vehicle fleet by ČD in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 carriages for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic fast tracks.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, unable to get rid of it.
We're utterly helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial office of the online daily Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is a tourist interesting walk in the treetops, but also the Olympic Park.
The highway managers know they're standing there black, but they say there's nothing they can do about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of such ads across the country.
Officials say the flimsy law is to blame for which illegal mobile billboards cannot be removed immediately.
What is needed is a complex bureaucratic wheel first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the bureau is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few yards away and the official process has to start over.
The Roads and Motorways Directorate admitted a quarter of a year ago: an off-the-line advertising billboard is on our land by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant ad poster.
It was as if no one mind was standing just next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone where, for safety, nothing could be done.
Road managers say they can't easily cope with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe load it up and take him away.
"We can't afford that," says Road and Motorway Directorate spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which began to be closely followed by the online daily Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot deal with effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
So are other counties.
"We have difficulty forcing companies to remove the signs," confirms the head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice Regional Authority, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are addressing such stories.
According to Klása, the leaky law that binds officials is to blame.
First, he has to approach the billboard owners in the intricate to get the ad out of it.
But company executives are often elusive or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has already described in the past when it became more interested in the issue: just move the mobile advertising stand a few metres away, and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising.
That's because the bureau has to pinpoint exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new facility and we have to reach out to the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could have been brought about by a new law that will ban billboards on the motorways from September next year and restrict them even at the I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and easily portable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities will not be relieved.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year from renting illegal areas, and no one can access them.
A billboard luring on Lipno, for example, is owned by Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the České Budějovice Municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with it for black-built billboards.
The company faces a 300,000 fine in each proceeding.
These are more advertisements that were placed without a permit in the protection zone of the I. class road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice Municipality.
The advertisement, which Aktuálně.cz is interested in, does not yet feature among these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to the spokesperson of the RMD Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case would be on the table for the county and then probably the city officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious firms that can't be contacted.
It does not accept the post office and cancelled the official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who became famous for his sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
But Fischer, whose company, Euro Billboard, rents the premises from Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has in the past rejected any connection.
This spring, when the RMD began to take an interest in the Lipno advertisement at the instigation of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his boarding house, where the company is believed to be based.
This address, however, has not been contacted by the highway managers to this day.
A vain fight.
Such silence or opaque changes to settlements are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company a few years ago for CZK 2 million.
But she changed the name and the IČO and there was nothing to deal with.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads kept standing, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such firms and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits on condition of anonymity.
The amendment to the law has not yet been addressed in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several MPs who were intrigued by the problem.
But they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining the billboards for the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national but also regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions; on the other, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don't hold the rather established impression that when something doesn't work, you need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy seeds, statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop is above the average for the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, the rapeseed harvest (by 3.9 per cent) and poppy (2.5 per cent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This is the result of an estimate that is as of 15. In July, the Czech Statistical Office published.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and projected a one-tenth drop from last year.
But last year's cereal harvest was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher this year.
Rape growers will harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due to both a reduction of the hectare yield by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the crop area.
Farmers have sowed three percent fewer fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, will be 4.3 percent less this year, according to an estimate.
The farmers planted it in more fields.
But the drop is to be borne by a lower hectare yield, which will drop to 6.04 tonnes.
The statisticians predict a roughly one-fifth drop in spring barley, which is most commonly used to make beer.
The reduction in the crop is due to a reduction in sowing areas by 15.2 per cent, but also a lower hectare yield.
In the on the other hand, the zythe is 6.3 percent more likely to be done.
There will also be a harvest of rye.
Rape crop is estimated at 1.305 million tonnes by statisticians, which is more than last year.
As the area of the crop area expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hecera yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, with a one-third larger in the area than it was a decade ago.
In the last four years, there has also been more poppy seeds.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
But compared to 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the seed area, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise 2.5 percent against last year to 27,423 tonnes.
But the hecera yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charged two men for a knife and a machete attack, and the court remanded them into custody.
Police charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete on Tuesday in the centre of Olomouc.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused a cut and cut injury, which required hospital treatment and further treatment," police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková said.
Both apparent perpetrators were apprehended by police officers immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to remand them in custody and was granted by the court on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Officers charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him with schievous and cuts, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened at noon on Tuesday at high noon on the Liberty avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková reported.
A mass scuffle between two families took place in the area of the garden in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Despite the attacking man trying to escape, they caused a cut and cut wound that required hospital treatment and other treatment, a police spokesperson said.
The scuffle, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre, and for which several police patrols and officers had to intervene at the scene, it was a family dispute.
Criminals charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to remand them in custody and the court upheld it on Friday, the spokesperson added.
The mashin was also used in the centre of Olomouc in a mass brawl by the attackers five years ago, it happened then only a few dozen metres further, in front of the disco show Varna in Riegrova Street.
Officers said at the time that a group of around ten foreigners carrying weapons attacked the guests of the establishment who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, canes and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the sprawling building of the former IPB residence in the middle of Senovážné Square.
It should have already functioned as a hotel.
But still nothing.
That there is a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often monument protection, are only faded and empty.
We chose the properties in the centre using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of their owners' financial problems, opaque relationships between companies, or are a state that can't or won't get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than the homeless.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Mr and Mrs Clinton earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to the Clintons for charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax statements on Friday, increasing the pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of the Clinton's income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, largely from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her election campaign.
The tax report showed that Mr and Mrs Clinton paid the federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, and then at nine percent of the state and local income tax.
In total, they paid 43.2 per cent of income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, and has not yet committed to the release of his tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump pays no tax at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after the release of her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy over Trump's income, including to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP reported.
Trump's wealth is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican nominee's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former First Lady, today published a report on his tax collections for the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity, and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
Boko Haram Islamists defended a rigorous vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of polio have reappeared.
In the northeast of the country, the government has issued an extraordinary vaccination there, as two children infected with the disease have paralyzed the disease.
The vaccines were flown by helicopters.
The affected area was powered by Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended the vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In northeast Nigeria, extra polio children will be vaccinated as two children injured in this disease.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be inoculated in the state of Borno and another four million in the states surrounding.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP, quickly delivered vaccines against polio to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area for many years undetected.
Boko Haram extremists have prevented vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were found to be found.
The two affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The WHO section director responsible for eradicating polio, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno state.
The area was not made available to international organisations and the government until early this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken in this part of the country in a major way.
Nigeria's health minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new cases of polio are a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce that polio had been eradicated in it next year.
The WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease had not occurred for two years, it was still spreading among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who were leaked from a gaffe gang thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look with confidence to the future.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against him.
Pope Francis met in Rome with 20 former prostitutes who were freed from the power of a pimp gang by the police.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and subsequently urged them to look confidently to the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes he visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to severe physical violence during the Vatican undergoed prostitution.
By visiting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against him, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April this year and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit the Jihadi's factories.
But without the help of Muslims, it will not be possible.
France is to be helped to fight radical Islamism by Muslims themselves.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls's government is preparing major changes in the functioning of the mosques and the education of clerics.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
Others will follow, the Interior Minister announced.
There are over a hundred Jihadi producers in the country.
"If Muslims do not assist the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom for this religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only the imams who were educated in France in the mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, it wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money is coming from abroad for the construction of new mosques, most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This, too, then, is brought to the mosques by preachers who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key to ensuring that these goals is met will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
This should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country is now the French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon hit by internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
In the French political scene, a debate erupted in the French political scene after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
It was all hastened by further terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently let it be known that a new foundation will be created in October this year.
It will have two main challenges - to secure the funding of mosques from home sources, as well as to oversee the imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centres.
But several proposals are being considered.
One is a special charge or a tax on halal food.
This would in practice be paid for by the decorators of halal food, for the provision of certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation's purse.
The allowance of ten to twenty euros ($270 to 540) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year there is about 30,000 on the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future only preachers who have been through special educational programmes at French universities should be active in the mosques.
This should ensure that the sermon is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
The French government is simultaneously in a campaign against the militants.
Others will follow, the Home Secretary recently announced.
There is no place for those who espouse hatred in the mosques and do not respect some of our country's principles, such as equality between women and men.
The country is estimated to have about 2,500 mosques and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled some 80 imam, and for several dozen more, they are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can hit hard against radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalised will do the same.
This is not the case in mosques, young people are radicalised online, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Trackman Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to the star Baugém.
The Czech track cyclist must fight for the last eight in the repair rides.
After advancing to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the railroad cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost the first round to the top 18 after advancing to the top 18 in the first round, the defending silver champion from the past London Games.
He must fight for the last eight in the nomination rounds.
The start of the royal discipline on the course was set by 27 riders and the best Czech tracker of the day claimed the fourteenth best time.
He made the 200 with a flight start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was expected to be in qualifying for fifth-placed Baugé, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kelemen drew the experienced Frenchman in the end, but he kept an eye on the progress.
A brilliant performance was flashed by the defending gold champion, Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton finished the third fastest 200 in history and won the qualifying in the Olympic record of 9.551 in the Olympic record.
He then easily, as expected, also dealt with the last advancer, which was German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet also flourished with Bradley Wiggins, who set up a new world record of 3-50.570 in the 4km pursuit and advanced to the final.
The previous best (3:51.659), which was the British for four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want a fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of the young doctors were gathered to approve the new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Junior Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek the full council to support further sectoral events in early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "alongside quietly" on questions, which is much to dismiss the contract.
She said: "In this light, the authority of the executive arm of the executive arm of JDC decided to reject the proposed new treaty in its entirety and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Board of the Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA board to approve the running programme of heated trade events in early September.
The dispute led the young physicians to announce up to six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
Leader of the young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned following a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
To the BMA members, he told the BMA meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the contract would be a burden for the medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of the "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month war of war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the sumptuous hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile, and he was hardly radiating warmth, even by his aloft standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dead friend" to Mr. Putin - five times, as one of the reports reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm betrayed the exact opposite.
But the lingering chill that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: Shooting down a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's response at the time was furious.
Putin was blowing the blows around him, accusing Ankara of crashing a knife in the back of Moscow.
The outrage was all the greater as it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to rebuild real trust.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media have conducted a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
Suddenly it looked as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
More serious was the accusations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology he had asked of President Erdogan.
Russia could declare some of the victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost stripped of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a harsh impact - mainly the cancellation of charter flights, which are carried by several million Russian tourists each year on the coast of Turkey.
This number decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely be relieved when flights are eventually resumed.
They make money from the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkish were again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," the Vedemosti newspaper report.
But the visit had further political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West for what it considers a feeble response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the prolonged animosity of the lengthy talks on joining the EU and the accession of Putin - eager to take advantage of the cooling and to break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly scored bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace to Russia and Turkey allowed us to demonstrate what one analysts described to me as "universities of the incompatible": how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West.
However, despite publicly showing mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently stood as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
You could say that after almost three hours of initial interviews, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight the differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both states can find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and the risk of total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's managing director, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It eased off them when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At the time, the strategic brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds for sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But it has now been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not run new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock market coding, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already in use.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that come to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his travels to customers and employees at Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
He told the BBC Scotland: ‘The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand our employees work for, because we are now much more branded in the brands.'
As the bank itself became a global brand, it also became a global brand for RBS.
I now say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts to the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something quite different in their own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championships, preparing the profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"Has it been a good time for us to move on to the brand's bank, because the basic question (of which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said that we would become a great bank for customers and introduce the brands.
But along with the way we focused on the needs of our customers, not on our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can recall these marks in vitiously, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horse Predilection leads to target 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after double victory in Newmarket earned him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the night on his local track - a Predilection horse, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in the flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time chorus of Dettori, who had previously won a horse on his horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is also here
I am extremely pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not the Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on the floor with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations as he brings Predelillaction
Two jockeys reached this milestone in the hurdles races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has led to the finish line of more than 4,300 winners during his career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached the milestone, which has only been reached by a few riders before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fazy, which distinguishes him from the other riders in the weighing ladder.
He is a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only ridden on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie rode the winner in the UK for the better part of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
It has a vivid character, which is good for British racing sport. But more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous fleeting jump
From the summer finishes to a fleeting jump - Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of the British flat racing for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
An overwrought number of winners of the big races, including his well-known "great sevens" in Ascot. But he also survived the crash of the plane and was banned from taking off for drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month launch ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all the doubters in the best of shape in spite of it.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50.
Russian President Putin Releases President's Head of President's Office Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
The 63-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin "relisted to Ivanov from his services to the head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
His seat will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who had been Ivanova's deputy since 2012.
Vajno, 44, was previously a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, in 1972, graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokiju.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state activities in the sense of draft laws and the control of the extent to which your guidelines are respected.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from the post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will he convince the smiles?
This move has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for the long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the presidential office chief at his own request.
But the smiles for the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once thought of as a possible president is suddenly eager to conduct Russia's environmental policies has been met with a lot of mistrust.
The Kremlin's website quotes remarks made to Putin in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in an interview in 2012, I asked you to give me four years in an interview for this very demanding post, you might say a problematic post.
I seem to have been president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and has previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB) as much as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov to one of his five closest associates.
Indeed, it was speculated at the time that Ivanov might succeed Putin as the head of state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's collaborator, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, star of the Idees of Criminal, was released after being hit by the director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC and CBS television stations, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played by Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences in the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry that this happened,' he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, the details of how the character of Gibson disappears from the series, which follows the stories of an FBI agent team, is a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, made famous for his lead roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has starred in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of the criminal, and over the last twelve years I have given heart and soul to them," Gibson said in his statement issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end. But that will not be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show has ever been hoping for.
The series' return to the 12th series is expected on September 28.
In the town of Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish may be the sand eel that left the water whirlwind.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope Canal, believing that someone might help him explain how the 5-centimetre fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects to Fife
£1.35bn project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - so the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of the four caps among the "siders of the platform" which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the construction today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said, "This is the historic moment and the symbolic moment of the Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all see how the civil engineers on an impressive scale of the exemplary use of more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge in its place, with the concrete for the last part of the platform now being cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be raised for the bridge.
Michael Martin, the project's leader at the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure for the construction of any bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the cutting edge of the building building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres in the southern direction.
This was both a massive and very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6 000 tonnes and it was necessary to pull it with a climb of about 3%.
Delican because the tolerances the team worked with was very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
Everything was going very well, thankfully.
Saving in Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'happy to be alive'
The three men are "happy to be alive" after being washed down by the water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescury Boat Station issued an alert at 1:20 p.m. on Friday, British summer time, after the crew saw the incident at Moelfre Bay.
The three men tried to swim to safety, while their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity, and we thought of the worst," said the helmsman of the lifeboat Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind blew him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man aged at the age of 60, found without a life jacket exhausted as he clung to the buoys.
All were transferred to the deck of the Coast Rescue Deboat and take them back to the rescue boat station
Jones said, "The three men toppling into the water are happy to be alive and unhurt.
The ship's engine had a rope for an emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the overturning.
Someone from above was holding a protective hand at the boys.
The judge refuses to hear the case for Tluchor's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three deputies who, according to the indictment, were to receive a political tobacconist from Prime Minister Nečas and his then chief of cabinet Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Shnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him to resign by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential posts in state-owned companies.
So, too, they were facing suspicion of a bribe and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongfully, and thus received compensation of a total of almost CZK 2 million.
Tluchoř is now appearing as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the courthouse on the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (addresses criminal matters) and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be put in charge of another Prague judicial district.
The king has already twice exonerated Jana Nečas, formerly Nagy.
It was an alleged use of military intelligence to track down Prime Minister Nečas Radka's first wife.
This case was not featured in Tluchoř.
According to the lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way for a court to be excluded if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to judge then, he noted to the Journal.
"It seems crazy," he added.
The case of political newsagents is also charged with Roman Boček, a former official.
But according to his lawyer, Petr Toman, the possible objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 heard on 13. June the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Jana Nagy (now Nečas) and other accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečas and her husband come to court.
Tluchor was to address the statements about Peroutka.
The ex-con's wife, for example, was to try President Miloš Zeman's remarks about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he had sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl appears to have been killed in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria, along with her two girlfriends of their same age, from London's Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Home Office did not comment on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who escaped from their homes were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana headed to their other former classmate at the Bethnal Green Academy School in London, according to the media.
The case drew a huge wave of attention last year, as did tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have so far travelled to Syria, about 50 of them young women and girls.
Many of them joined the militants of IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream job for a $100,000 salary.
A well-paid job that you don't even need college for.
This is what the I.T. job looks like at first glance.
And often to the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech standards (in Prague, you earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to the huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists short.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most wanted, according to statistics from the staffing agency Grafton, are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
So the candidates are not competing for the job position, but the jobs for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for IT people.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and education, but he often has little to do with knowledge of the development.
Developers have to learn new things all the time, which will not be replaced by a graduate college, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most profitable is in Prague.
The I.T. wages everywhere move high above the Republic average.
They come to the most money in Prague and Brno, it is not such a hit parade in the regions.
"The winter conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague," confirms Kubačka.
The highest earnings will be achieved by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80,000 there either.
Also in demand are IT project managers.
When they start, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
There is also a fight for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case with I.T.
In fact, if companies are to be pulled over and overcharged by an expert from another company, they are happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him their own way.
They can't do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is required in I.T.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a number of cases where companies are looking for a particularly well-educated and experienced person and is content only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign language, he is of interest to his employer because it can serve more customers from different countries, adds director Kubačka.
Yeah, in Google, there's a paradise.
Only the Czech workers are quietly envious of the employees at Google.
Of course there is flexible working hours for them, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not only for mums.
"The company provides new dads with four extra weeks of leave after the birth of the child," says Martina Jonek, a Google spokesperson.
The cherry also includes health care for the staff and the family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages directly in the workplace.
Those who want to be educated are green and it doesn't matter what new one wants to learn.
But the benefits do not stop there.
Such a full free fridge is definitely not a bad one either.
A healthy lunch (even breakfast and dinner in some locations) are available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microcitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And to avoid having to throw away, whatever you don't eat, he puts in the boxes that the staff can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these unbelievable advantages for the Czech situation?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, a shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
On Thursday, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "poises serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for the criminal armed fighters who are boldly orchestrising frisons on refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross to Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
What is even worse - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, with 21,000 last year for the same period.
Pokémon Go - the hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Many people have lamented over the last decade that teenagers and children no longer play outdoors and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people out of the sofa and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens was originally shrank to television, later to video games and, most recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities out there are no mutually exclusive defections.
I am, of course, talking about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before this new play was launched in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder in a few days, and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the smartphone players go out to look for the Pokémon, which they follow with GPS, and when they find them, they can "take pictures" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "catch."
Mania has gripped a generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it from its seats and driving out to find Pokémon.
In the US, this game has seen a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person does every day.
The Apple's smartwatch Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people surveyed who practiced for 30 minutes each day has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company does not have information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data on the levels of the exercise.
Many public campaigns to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" fell to barren ground, because most of the public health messages are boring and designed for people who don't look good.
Yet the importance of the exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully mention here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and the rays of the sun. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt for pokemons.
As is usually the case, of course, there will be some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone could walk in the door.
What, like?
There was a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphone apps, like the Fitbit, could track our activity, but gave us no reason to do something like this game did.
The news is seen and the interest in it begins to subside at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokemon, other games will emerge that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, helping a number of people hunt for activity, health and a better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in multi-marchae gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the beam.
In the floor, everyone was speechless.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in the multi-event event on Thursday, overcoming the others on the full line below the Olympic floodlights.
The overall result of 62.198 was clearly confirmed by her lead over the silver medalist and the "Final Five" team member Aly Raismanova and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the beam in the final of the individual's multi-batquail at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth female American in a row to win the multi-fight, and fifth overall, by confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final standings were on the board and her long journey to the end of it until that moment, tears came to her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of singular athletes of his time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 gold medals. Her stunning lineups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than a return home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman are embracing the final of the individual women's all-rounder after winning the gold and silver medals in the final of the women's multi-event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first one on Tuesday, when she was an exclamation point in celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked ahead during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her lineup in the floor - the one that contains a typical triple, double-turnover somersault - is set in Latin music that would just be suitable for home, to the streets outside the Olympic arenas in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by the trainer's mother, Aimee Boorman, on her way to the gym, where Boorman was training and where she gained strength.
She has not lost the competition in the multi-event since the summer of 2013 - a succession of victories that can continue for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time through two turns, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the floor - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She went back to the lead with 15.433 points per beam - and finished with 15.933 points in the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears of tears appeared around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows when a wish she had once made to her little one, as a little girl, wrote in her diary, came true.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze for the sum of the top three lineups.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "Grandma" was way ahead.
After her floor, she sent the crowd air kisses, conquered by a return that seemed unsteady at times.
For Biles, the post this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a total hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a girl aged 12 died during the most underperpetle attack of the decade, the first serial killer in the Phoenix. They were shot while they were in the car, talking and listening to the music.
Authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot 12 on 12 in a car parked in the driveway in the driveway.
The report states that the armed man was on the passenger's side and fired eight shots from the handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the robbery is not worth the triple murder because the assailant did not take his wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
A spokesman for the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were investigating whether the shooting was connected to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in four months in which seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"It's happening in the residential area in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for a CBS branch of KPHO.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late '90s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and daughter Ellis Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for the women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe it was the serial killer.
Investigators found casing and a bullet hole from the remains of bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcelephaly: ‘His condition is improving’
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, I first thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you're ready for it,' she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, had learned that Edmund might never have known them, and that she might not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this anymore," Picciut explains.
Edmund comes with a walker's help.
Until the age of three, he couldn't sit or crawl. And he's still not talking.
But some milestones are already filling up.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is performing a sign language with which Edmund says "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him a sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says that Edmund made up some of the characters himself.
Microcyphalism can emerge from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may differ in a significant way.
It's too early to say the impact of the Zika virus on the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax that an uncertain future takes away.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What happens next?
And she's still not sure about that.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don't expect anyone to tell me at all.
Picciut, however, has an encouraging report for the mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and massive flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. Further rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi would be blown out of their shores and threaten to flood plague.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance was already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Standaking for Emergency Situations, said they received vehicle requests for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa precinct alone asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that there may be more 8 to 13 centimers of more rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on alert Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
According to the forecast, the Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are to peak this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further said that the danger was flooding downstream in Ascension County, when these swollen streams would be sunk into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, slightly further south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest levels recorded at the level at 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the torrendulum waters of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of the Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson's stepson were previously among the Protected at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his next stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had her up to the waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all the members of his family were disabled and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and took them to the fire station in the Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding "fast is spreading" with continued heavy rains, and authorities were considering evacuating.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinstol reported that 35 centimetres of rainfall had fallen from midnight to Friday to early morning.
Krautmann said the land had been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid-for trips required residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of instruction in five school districts.
The CBS's WiFi office in WWL reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elder from Tangipaho.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now inundated.
The mayor of the municipality, Robby Miller, said that authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that were imprisoned by the high water.
In the municipality of Amite and in the town of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to go home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and local residents were given sandbags to be picked up and tried to protect their homes and businesses from the waters.
"The last major flooding was in March," said the city manager, Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be like this.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager at Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain was continuing on the Gulf coast.
He said a couple of home floods was announced on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - 'children shot up as a scorch', survived shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week is the second shooting at a child aged 6 in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including the groin, foot, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He took in an awful lot, his little body was shot through like a sieve," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was to enter the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, with two more victims in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the station's reports, the child was found to have been shot in the front seat of the vehicle, along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are examining whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was likely to be a shootout between several armed men.
Casing was found at the scene from weapons of an offensive type belonging to various offensive weapons.
By all accounts, it was certainly a continuing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the side of the sidewalk on the street.
So it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi said.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been apprehended and police are reportedly examining video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this one girl, was shot in the arm with a stray shot in front of a home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black women and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
The number one Gymnasso in the past four years has been an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who had produced the unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the female individual competition.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing a sporting highlight, but in gymnastics classes in the country it doesn't look like it.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" as the gymnasts' team for the next Olympic Games will only be made up of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi coaches.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the cost of training, training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their charges and families). And that's far from all.
Most of these sports clubs are in the rich areas of the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, the gymnasts have all the training sessions and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they began gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring in gymnastics training, which is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who were inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or at low cost in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly of the Hispanic and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and co-ordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, achievements in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will be sent to us by thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participating in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing you the "girl's strength" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to set out on the road to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal to be rejected, young doctors are ready to enter more strikes
Ministers hoped that after the reworked treaty with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements over the changes would be brought to an end. But 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
In July, Hunt uncovered plans to enforce the contract, saying that the NHS was in a "no man's land" and a further delay would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care in unsolocal hours.
In a statement last night, the doctore for BMA, the president of the BMA for Young Doctor's Companion, said: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor force crisis and thus a fair treatment for all doctors."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors reaches the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with a reluctance to involve dr.hysec and the government's deafening silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for the compulsion and resolve the concerns of the young doctors."
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as the nurses and specialists were called to take the standstill of doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the recast contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), there would be disagreements about the changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work on a weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, called on young doctors not to take the strike.
Mortimer said: "Nothing or nothing is achieved by the choral event, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families will increase."
Over the past two months, we have held talks with the Young Physicians' Board of Directors and, together with the Ministry of Health, and others, have responded positively to concerns about the role of the supervisor and the informant.
Employers had hoped that the continued positive involvement on other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training training for those returning after the interruption of their careers, the cost of training, the mutual recognition of courses, study time off, and the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health took the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for sixty crowns per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend administering it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The Cancer for Criting Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now being given for 12 months after suffering a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another stroke or heart attack.
Heart and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is disconnected, a blood clot may be formed, the blood access to the heart may be blocked and a heart attack can occur.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue, blocking the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at greater risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of stopping clots less likely.
The NICE proposal, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and are suffering from another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
It is shown that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased that, with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
As information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - particularly about the risk of bleeding - beyond three years, is not recommended in the proposal for treatment beyond this time.
With computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas
Tower Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to the government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard for the spreading fraud in Muslim communities, a government report says today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse for "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of the anti-corruption crackdown, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion was so bad that the police should make cordones and protect the frightened voters in front of the polling stations.
He recommended that voters take their identity document with them and be able to prove who they are at the election.
At present, the voters need only give their name and address.
The report also proposes to apply indelible ink to the fingers of the person when handing over the voice to the voice in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for the press to be given greater access to the documents of the meeting and to the decisions taken by the unofficial committees or the group's workmanship.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at the Tower of Hamlets in West London.
A special electoral court ruled last year, the incumbent mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post after allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically intervened" with the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, "hanged his campaign to be the religious duty of loyal Muslims, to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were cast in doubt or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and sets out to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the correspondence vote - which is claimed to have been put under pressure by the elderly members of the Muslim community to vote for the candidate they had elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: "There has been evidence to be provided that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, particularly in the communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There were fears that . . . state institutions had turned a blind eye against such behavior because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to be banned from manipulating correspondent votes to prevent "enforcement of votes."
The report, now being assessed by Theresa May, also asks for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of the election lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to provide an ID before the vote.
The use of indelible ink on the fingers of people in the vote to avoid being voted twice.
The implementation of systematic checks of the nationalities of the nationalities to ensure that they are allowed to vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting to be limited to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating the submitted correspondence votes and campaign envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who exert illicit coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Forbidding the taking of photographs at the polling stations.
To demand that only the English work at the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police, saying it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has expelled Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of proof of a crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless "check of the check boxes" in the council's registration departments at City Hall.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case waking up.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some are threatening this reputation.
The robbery of the cycling double of Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of famous personalities at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games went crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete aiming for gold this year to boast her own double from a ranks of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the well-known figures currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely like Hollywood celebrities.
As hunted game: U.Schromots Archer Team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared since he was a little girl compared to Leonardo DiCaprio
Next to the Kate doppel on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
The competitor from the American archer team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures surfaced, with a striking resemblance to the Wall Street wolf.
In his own self-inflicted media frenzy, Brady admitted to hearing from his similarities with Leo since he was a little girl.
"He doesn't see much of a similarity myself, except perhaps the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he's looking good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular London 2012 comparisons will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: a striking appearance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafinova, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series, Gell Matthew Morrison, for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks Nathan with the "athlete version" of the actor from Origin (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same dark skin and blonde hair as Annalynnne McCord. And of Nathan Adrian of the US team, fans say he looks like a "athlete version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Fitting women: Football star Hope Sol (left) and actress of the series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face-shaped shape
Not just one: Twitter's user was very pleased to see the resemblance of the resemblance to others
On the wave of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind similar pairs' appearance
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Carpenter are in truth identical in truth."
Football star Hope Sol and the show's actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face-to-eye shape.
Among the other popular comparisons are Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics champion Gabby Douglas, who boasts her exquisitely wide smile, who seems to be copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo Girls,!
CBC Olympic gaming commentator apologizes for saying of the Chinese swimmer that she "bumped out"
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games on CBC were outraged by the analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's 4x200m free-ticket
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "taken like a stink" during the race and "bumped up."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the final, the women's 4x200-meter relay relay in a free style began to churn out his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "aanimation" to the CBC's team of commentators, said, among other things, "The 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Too much excitement, it ran like a stench, blew up.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race at 1:57.79 - a 1.61sec slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to drag out China.
Viewers in Canada began to sound quickly online and were appalled by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Did the CBC announcer claiming that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "brewed up"?????"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his dismissal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald he was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like a bunch of racists.#Godasted.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's lively commentary and said, "We apologize for the commentary on the swimmer's performance that had escaped the air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry to see it happen."
CBC eventually apologized to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Associate Professor Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and placed their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments from the columnist MacDonal
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
She sincerely regrets the words being uttered, not getting on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, this was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron is deeply apologetic for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and attempted to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect, and I'm very sorry for me."
Customers in Primark scandalized by a woman who shamelessly tried her underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman took off her clothes to try out her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, the shoppers weren't sure which direction to look.
To make it worse, she tried to see her size fit, to remove her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse, and finally tried out four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman was rehearsing her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that the mystery woman, after trying her underwear, "dressed up and came out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the shop, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, rude as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at the panties taking off their panties again, and evidently they didn't like them because they were brought back to the shelf."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed again, and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was watching-or thought of the man who might be buying the panties she was trying to."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said, "The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else was wearing and not being cleaned. That's gross.'
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added, "When she left, I gathered up things that she was evidently trying to get them off sale - what's the only right thing to do, either."
"I'd be dismayed by the idea of bringing new panties home and discovering that they were worn by another woman, who took them off, and they weren't was washed up."
Trade spokesman Primark said, "The gun is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9."
All the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a gun attack with Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but with this Dailymail.com video, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, the grandmaster of the New York-based Krav Magy Federation, to see how to cope with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over the rapist, whether he comes nearing the front or from behind.
If he comes near the back of you, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "meave a free-track of the missile."
You will then seize the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows the groin, and while the attacker writhes in pain, you wriggle the gun out of his hand, hit him in the face, and start retreating, the weapon being held at him.
If an armed man is approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and rouse it so the scoundrel can't shoot.
At the same time, put the force in the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then flee his grip, and begin to retreat, keep at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get out of the ambush - unless you're the grandmaster Krav Maga - is to issue all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright olilizes the dirtiest places in Europe to the travel guide
The British traveller decided to give a heavy test to his immune system and a gagging reflex - licking the dirtiest and inilterest places in Europe.
The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, dressed as a test of the power of his immune system, embraced the euro banknote with his tongue, the railing at Piccadilly Circus, the flushing button on the train's bathroom and the Russian public phone.
Before wearing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment, on the basis of which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot, however, yielded interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem utterly repulsive, however, for example, in the kitchen sink there is actually a lot more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his travels in Europe, Ian Wright has spoken to health-care doctors and health specialists about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the linden left him any worse than the aftertaste in his mouth.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the road around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system quite safely - from the public railings at the train stations to the flusher
In the film he shot about it, he says, "I haven't really cared about my health since I was a kid, and I put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water."
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused were the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple luminaire maneuver, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick it after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy product manufacturer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the ugliest I've ever felt in the toilet."
Nothing dirtier than this doesn't exist!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamins C and D, which in humans help to strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's senior vice president for refreshments, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something to watch with the fascination and, at the same time, allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've devised a lot of crazy ideas that ended in the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy gut is a global phenomenon and through this paper we have given consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humour in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked up some of what I wanted him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we filmed the lick of some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 showing that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents said they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of socially needy before the eviction vandalized a municipal building in the town of Saltash in Cornwall
The socially needy family left £50,000 worth of damage to their municipal house after being accused of terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in the city of Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcibly evicting from the house, housing association officials were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was litched all over the floor, and the walls were scrawled.
The family has already moved out and is believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether the house could be rescued.
She said, "It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will probably come to prominence as "not such a nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and police said that the reign of the family's homemakers were street fights using baseball hats, intimidation of the surrounding residents, drug use, drug use and loud shouting, quarrels and curses.
Skeldon (47), whose name was on the lease, was given a sentence in June for anti-social behaviour.
Several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, were found token of discouraging garbage.
The house where the drugs had been distributed in the past had a torn-out flooring
Neighbors say they've been seen fighting in the street, and people have been calling the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the house this week after receiving an additional 11-week period to emigrate voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved greeted the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count it at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to that!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the Neighborhood Manager for Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said the family had failed to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called to the house by the police
Garbage and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: "It is a disgrace that the tenant has failed to accept responsibility for her own behaviour and for the behaviour of her family. The eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be frightened by their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope this move will bring a little comfort to the neighbours, and at the same time carry a message that we will not tolerate unsocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants who lived in the house at different times were in the house for about 20 years.
A polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, the shelf in the house raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs that she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundations of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth after the eviction.
The walls in many of the house's rooms were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who break the rules of their lease agreements
Angela Crowe of the Den and Cornwall police said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The Days and Cornwalls Police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-floor military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun's rays in Aveil, Portugal, were terrified to death
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew in an incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight, and insisted there had been no threat to safety
By the time the low-flying jet descended on the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were in forgrown panic.
The dramatic footage shows the military plane getting within a distance of almost a touch from the sunshine-hunting people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines without seeing what emerges from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted video recordings of a dramatic flyover on social networks, said: "The plane flew in properly low and at one point it seemed to be crashing."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I surfed, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on a beach in Aveil were horrified when a plane flying low-lipped a plane came out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify the fishing boat off the coast and had to bear himself low because it was the only way to check the ships.
The aircraft reportedly flew a little lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of the people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer, resulting in four fatalities on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from viewing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boat as part of his training.
Half of the funeral services are not complying with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
Funeral services are most likely to inform survivors of their prices or issue a written acknowledgement of receipt of the order.
The CHOI imposed 41 fines for a total value of CZK 73,000.
Today, its spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, reported the news.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing prices and missing certificates, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It involved urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with the required information.
"As the law is still being violated in this specific area of services, the auditing operation will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiz Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, had died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee's attorney said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that it was likely to be killed during a Russian air attack in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"Man wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to the war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as the Supreme Court's nominee.
Senate leader for the Democratic Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says he believes the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be chosen by a future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believed Clinton would select Garlanda "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "swimmolate the ship" by electing someone else.
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said the republicans that block Garland's appointment were "depletters" and "jolk" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump didn't fit in office.
According to Treats, nude calendars are for "women and for men"
Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Belleer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of the unveiled celebrities, he tries to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nahety magazine was different from Playboy from the old-school, because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for the women.
He clearly believes the calendar is also the calendar.
"We must return to the display of timeless and classical nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body," Shaw said in a press release for the calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is the vinyl going: who really buys the gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lone men in middle age.
Before you decide to overwhelm the section with peppery notes under the pseudonym No AllThessals' Free-MenAngelospaceVIvoire, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramophone records is associated with the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of the ownership of the physical object, but with the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan either - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV report, I would be watched by a camera setting out on a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing widely. Then I'd stop by, and he'd pull out his hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look at it.
As Soho's charm and charm slowly fade from the heart - the buildings once occupied by independent retailers, hotels, restaurants, and canteens, ready-to-wear and office supplies are now filled with hotels, and office supplies - several fantastic specialist gramophone board stores.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I will stand near the various men in these shops and try to observe what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (twelling: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (almost: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to fill in a few hours of time.
I ask him if he is a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3 or 4,000 recordings.
All the recordings are lined with the walls of his living room - in the picture upstairs (he e-mailed the photo to me, I didn't follow him home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy record-fashioned records he couldn't afford when it came out in the first place, and he's buying again what he sold in his youth and he didn't even have a penny.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and the early '70s. It's stuff that would be published when I was 11 or 12. I was too young then and I couldn't get it," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meet fit in with the YouGov profile.
He also noted a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who had heard of the comeback and felt forced to buy their old record labels back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their record labels and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their record labels back," he says.
This could explain the boom in gramophone lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of the gramophone records?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that you find a pleasant community of people with similar sentiments in the music shops.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly scandalized by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of the gramophone records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar envelope of the record label, things that bring back memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think filling in a loophole or owning something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, I do, and I think for a lot of people, too.
It's an easy way to fill the spot in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" comes a co-worker from a pile of record labels.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a gramophone who never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records do not have a gramophone.
At this point of the story, he was probably very concerned about walking through the pile of chataba bossa nova.
The commodity of "trofia" and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42) noted, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
'Someone came in recently and said, 'I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead on my desk so we can put it on display on the shelf,'" he says.
The percentage of those is not great, but it is.
It's more about the product side than the music.
We have people coming to us who say, "I don't have arose at the Gramophone."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost a full floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are seventy-year-olds pairs, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - instead of pulling jazz, the latest Wild Beasts pop is heard from the speakers and sex, it is good to see diverse customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to gauge the intrusive mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes and looks at various gramophone records at a discount.
She is one of those who looks at the expenses rather than spend frantically.
In her words, she doesn't make much money, so there's no question of collecting record labels.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something. But the gramophone records have their charms . . ."
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of the girls in the tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are currently congregating around Polaroid's cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy the gramophone Crosley.
To the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of record music.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are so high up on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money is more likely than in other areas, is also the one where it is spent the most luxurious goods as vinyl.
But while, to my findings, the results of YouGov appear to be accurate - at least in the gramophone board stores, they do not take into account the large number of vinyl-lovers who actually exist, in the gramophone record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
He's certainly not spending a week's wandering around the gramophone record stores on Berwick Street, going through recordings, and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV host hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenlandic shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - a video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows the female, whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 and five metres long
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court appearance this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people sell goods inside the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair hair cut, sell tea for 50 cents in makeshift restaurants or basic dishes for several euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the sites had to be demolished because they pose a parallel economy that did not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations told the court that shops and restaurants were vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups did not provide a food supplement for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
The disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 makeshift shops, but stated that the prefect Calais's objections were ‘completely understandable’.
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants had a much bigger role to play in the middle of serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites facing demolition was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons a day, and asylum counselling for hundreds of at-atfee-atfected minors in the camp.
A petition to protect the "children's" cafe was signed by more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the cafe would "it would be a disaster for these children, some of them only 8 years old."
The charities Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the numbers of refugees in the camp rose to more than 9,000 after a steep rise in arrivals during the summer - the highest ever so far.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč is editing himself and the volleyball Mouth.
"I've been able to train normally since March," he said, reporting at the start of his summer training in full force.
What was the matter with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then also heart problems.
Because when I was at the Universiade in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
I was hurt, nobody found me anything.
Then the clot went up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's going to hurt all the time, especially when the weather is working or the weather changes.
But nothing to limit me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you concerned about your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevětnice I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood in the evening.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was finished for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Dřevěnice, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else before.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to watch myself more if I go anywhere.
But you can do everything with it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I had been fitness-prepared at home alone to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, physically, I'm better at it than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm excited, the gang looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about two other strangers coming.
Hopefully we'll sit down humanly to make it fit.
Will you lift Ústí?
It had a reputation for being a toupee, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it came second.
There's a new team in Ústí, with only a few players left.
It was the last one in the offseason, so there's plenty of room to improve.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see who's bummed after the first rounds, we'll hopefully not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's experienced now and he's been through a lot, he'll think of better than the last place.
But my arrival was unrelated to him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one and it was agreed that he would be here to operate.
I'm not calling the name.
In the end, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to heckle and I like to get the opportunity in a not-so-top team.
I have been in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, in Ústí the Australian Boehm is already coaching.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, I've played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we had a few conversations there a few times, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3-1, I put it in for him right away at the start of the summer training in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a charmer.
Also arriving is the American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze.
Do you know anything about them?
I texted with the American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, I mean, whoever's creating, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately researched what kind of player he was, I found him on the internet, how he played, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in.
How do you look forward to the number one recording number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm going to be twenty-four, after all, and I don't have the temperament to go in turns.
I'd rather be at the center of the action, I'd rather run the team than have someone else leading the team.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I were to be like a second recording artist and devote myself to it at full time. When something is not done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in Pribram, when it didn't go as Kusta as the captain, got hurt, then there were problems with the money and he left.
We've been climbing ever since then, and I've played all the time.
In Brno, of whom I am a devotee, I alternated number one and a B.
Excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and it was Příbram that chose.
The Budejovice wanted me from from there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half-op remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and his mother cheered in the audience again, with his son Boomer sleeping peacefully with the headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - I started swimming competitively 20 years ago and in a few hours it'll be over, he said with emotion.
In the final, Phelps was nearly two seconds behind the silver Japanese, Kosuke Hagino, who won a long halfpipe.
The bronze went to China's Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline at last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (Discab) and Carlo Lewis (Distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to take the same event at four consecutive games.
For most of the race, another American, Ryan Lochte, and home side Thiago Perreira held the lead.
While the defending gold champion deployed in the final frog's 50 to a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand its unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the semifinal's ceremony, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly.
The Legend could not be overshadowed by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double - he won the 100 in Rio and the double track in the 100.
He left Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind the final, with Russian Yevgeny Rylov in the third.
While Murphy has only fifth place in the 200 from last year's World Championships, he became the b signing king in Rio.
He dethroned Larkin, who had the same double at last year's world championships, dethroned from the imaginary throne.
At the Olympics, however, he won a medal only now.
The scanthorn 100 was shared by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For 16-year-old Oleksiaka, it was the fourth medal at these Games, second for Manuel after the silver of the relay.
She won the swimming gold at the Olympics as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, sport becomes a love for them and they get to where I go to where I go, a tearful Manuel said.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter butterfly in the world record in the world record and still has silver from the 200-seat scythe.
The sixth was the world record holder, Australia's Cate Campbell.
The Brethren 200 was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, for whom it is her first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
She has no valuable metal or World Championship, her best being fourth in the event in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russian Yulia Yefimova, who is facing both spectators and rivals' animosity to start at the Games despite her doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should still answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
She won the Rio start right only at a special panel of the CAS Sports Arbitration just before the start of the Games.
They were looking into my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if he has a different opinion, whether he goes to the Arbitration Court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointing, we could have won.
And take off at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was only less than an hour before the game that they learned who they were going to start against.
They had to quickly master tactical preparation.
And then, at an unconventional time, the game began on a small No.1 court.
They did not start the first set well, then drew the advantage of the opponents, but failed to make the final at 19:19.
In the second they were clearly better and drew level, but the decisive tie-break did not work out.
In particular, a number of broken service members were a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann said.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I missed the reception I'd gotten used to before.
We lost the set, which was the key.
In the next set we came on to them with an overview on the pitch, a different defence and we pushed the service.
There was a terribly rotten serve in the tie-break, there we took it off on this side.
It was a disappointment because we could have beaten the Russians.
Sluková: Pity about the start of the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to pull it down, but we missed the points.
The second set was cool and in the third he decided the service.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and the five was, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the little court number 1?
Sluková: Similar to China's secondary backyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete silence, the music not playing, nothing.
That was the difference with the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the opponent's names an hour before the game?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opposing team, so we couldn't make tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (kick Nausch) had set up a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactics paperwork ready, so on this side we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 10:30, but not at 12.
Russian Birlova's block in the playoff round at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a hug in the play-off round at the Rio Olympics.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group from ten, we have had the regime shifted before.
This was two more hours more.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to perform their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since advancing from the group was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, it's good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep with it and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big Brother is here, here comes the first peeping SIM.
You're not escaping her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM of a local operator when they are in Thailand.
That is, not only to tourists, but also to people with long-term visas who work in or have married in Thailand, for example.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, had informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for exclusively foreigners was unveiled by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
The new measure to enable the monitoring of their location is planned to be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security that will make it possible to address criminal activity committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect those who are over the permitted length of stay.
For retailers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear alongside SIM exclusively for Tha's SIMs within six months.
The differential will be the tracking feature, which will be permanently on for cards to persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM function is not for Thais, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith said.
It should be added that in Thailand the forwards are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave away free starter SIM to tourists at airports.
They were thus fully anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is being considered by ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries, including, for example, Malaysia and Singapore.
They also currently have a mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the forthcoming measure does not mean for foreigners to purchase a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of that country know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, that is to say, after the SIM has come to their network.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming charges compared to those of local operators is so abysmal that most tourists will start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to have oversight of the movement of foreigners have been lawfully received immediate criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith is reassuring the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, compares the forthcoming system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will face an unspecified punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he or she will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific figure will currently be recycled only after the 90-day deadline, after which the SIM did not sign up to the network, the number could be restored after 15 days in the event of leaving Thailand.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care for the property is handled by the caregiver.
The condition was enough parking spaces and a lift in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
The condition was also the large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová with her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend working with a specialist for everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he designs an apartment from the beginning, it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: the designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to sweeten the interior appropriately.
We collaborated with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, the obvious choice for us was also during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous socio-residential space with a corresponding background for a family of four conceived as a modern but not a cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and implement the intelligent home control.
And, of course, the quality of the design had to be noted.
Have you left everything to the experts, or did you yourself interfere with the final interior design?
We approved all the designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design was always made by the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors that, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then verified whether they were fine-tuning all together by means of visualisations.
Have there been any complications in the realisation of which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction site at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned were actually shading the surrounding buildings.
At that time, we changed the layout literally overnight from the ground up.
On the kitchen counter and for the lining of the fireplace wall, granite was used.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, such as the upholstery of Norma and Arper bar chairs.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making changes or is there anything you wish for otherwise today?
I take it that it is a modern airy interior that, above all, fits its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the plane of shielding and settling of terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when the nutty wood turns out to be too delicate for the household with the dog.
Slovo of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior, the placement of sun tunnels in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilets are an important feature.
This gave us daylight to the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and a Jacuzzi.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just off the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which would give me a job in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere among the people.
I felt like every Frenchman was terribly negative.
People in France are negatively attuned in general, but it has gotten worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
Some people rate the Czech character this way.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
It may not seem like that to some people when they come to France, because they don't see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, yet the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is, moreover, the problem with people's behaviour towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbour started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel comfortable in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work basically anywhere else and came across a vacancy with Air France here in Prague.
I confess that I did not know Prague at all at the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress however I can and no one will judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable looking at you, like when you're wearing special clothes and the like.
In Prague, I started to feel really single.
Praguers don't care about such things, I think.
Where do you work now?
After my job at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then, with another friend, we set up a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
We are only operating in Prague so far, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czechs, and two other Czech friends.
I must say that the next specificity of the Czechs is that they keep their distance more at first.
They're not letting someone get to the body.
That's quite the difference from where I grew up.
To the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it pretty simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in convenience stores or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I have no such need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Like because you're Muslim?
Not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, the Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something along the lines of: They are not the French, they are Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that anyone would have a problem with being a Muslim, I've never had.
This was despite the fact that a colleague once drew my attention to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said not to go downtown, he said they'd call me names.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are in part linked to the terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything anywhere can happen these days.
Until recently, I might not have imagined something like this to happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize the violence at all.
To me, the people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says a man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about the terrorists being shielded by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to watch the news of violence much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at George Square from Poděbrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with the violence.
I don't think they'd have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My associates, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a bit more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they were learning Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate of a woman's status.
How do you feel about that?
I don't seem subordinate in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It also has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
For example, a hijab?
And it's mostly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a truly principled Muslim.
He praises himself five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She's always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone how they interpret it.
When one reads the Koran, one should make up your own mind about these things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to, say, Iran or Saudi Arabia, where they require scarves, I'll marry him.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I'm great at Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this, I think.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Yachtsman Kozelska Fencl's wind in Rio was blown into the runners-up spot.
Friday's seas in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were published by Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelska Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth in place before the final two races.
That would give the Czech a seat in the final run.
You'll pick up the packets like Pokemon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea to use the already planned shipment trips are the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, life was breathed into a trio of applications with different geographical scope.
We launched the national application I transferred in May.
There are 1,000 cities in it at the moment, and we will be expanding the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this than we will focus more on abroad, the 41-year-old manager says in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Swiarpen app work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
You can then enter the route and the data on how large a package you can manage to transfer and how much you want for it.
Someone might be asking for a transfer on that day.
When the route and delivery time suit, it is paired and both of them come with a mutual notification.
That's when the cottage opens, where the couple will arrange the handover.
How many people do you think would have to register to always find each package their courier?
I do not know the ideal condition, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many journeys it takes to make the coverage quite optimal and each supply to be paired with demand.
It already works on the main draws, and it's logically easier than, say, on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust in the meantime, finding that no one escapes with the package.
Haven't you had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have two months after the startup?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6,000 people who create the roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that others will be packed.
Isn't there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competition for the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
At a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you pay a hundred or so less, because that's the path someone is already doing business.
Should traditional carriers be worried about a possible decline in customers in the future?
We hope it will be.
The market has enormous potential, the huge transnational carriers are feeding here, as are the retail chains, where they all started shopping and gradually found that the quality was not the responsibility for what they paid for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox saying to pick up the package at the branch, not until the day after 7 p.m.
I'd needed a package for six hours by then, and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that doesn't annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses the already planned travel between the world's metropolises to transport packages, primarily by air.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the Premium in December last year and were released in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
They developed the Mesík and Mesík Profi apps from this January and made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the start to do all these apps that would one day be combined into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the app and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic of late, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren't you worried about being in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the sharing boundaries and where the shadow economy is?
It's the same, except a different product.
We understand that if it's a success and we go up with it, we'll be the next thorn in the side through the grey economy.
But even though someone spares and makes a profit, it is not the intention to circumvent the tax authorities and tax inspections.
Every user, either side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make it.
What do you think the service has such great potential for?
The sender saves and the transfer earns, respectively, reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the powerful idea that combines interest on both sides.
In the social networking era that divide people, we'd like this one to get closer together.
Nice stories can be made, people are happy to help someone and will talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, in my opinion, have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we're saying about this app that it's a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not flee?
Each user of the app, together with the registration, will scan the ID card and the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give credit to the service and the person's credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the senders' ratings.
We will also offer insurance, the details are still being tuned.
The uninsured shipment is liable to the courier in the event of loss or damage, but does not take responsibility for the content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a closed packet in a sealed packet in his trunk by a machine gun or ten kilos of hash, the sender is overridden.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, the traceability of the administrative authority, which is the only one to be able to consult it, nor are we ourselves able to see it, the data is against the misuse protected.
How much money does a courier get in hand after a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged an extra few percent for facilitating contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push for volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the package when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery is verified by QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a sycamore egg and the size of a bass of beers.
After that, there is no further restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they will transport the fridge.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he is asked to do.
You don't even have to pack the thing if you don't want to hide the content outright.
You shove the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend had the idea more than two years ago, I didn't pay much attention to it at the time.
Then he showed me a demo of a transnational-scale-to-reach app that mainly targets air passengers.
At that moment, I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to become him myself and put savings into it.
The next year took a development than we founded Shippansee LTD in London because of the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are now focusing on.
No, we focused the marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to retrofit the app because the whole thing was in the labor pain and there is still room to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and we are not so concerned about the foreign market at the moment.
We know it's a long shot, but we're not in, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way an upgrade.
The transfer was created when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third Mesík app is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address to the other side of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Převez. But the difference is that as a courier, you see shipments in the form of points on the map closest to you, thanks to the geo-locator on your mobile.
We called the app for couriers who want to make a living from it, we called Mesík Profi.
So can anyone make outright make extra money by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
As everyone's fooling around with the pokemons now, they can collect this just the same way.
You can see where there are commissions around the city, you come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and the package is transferred.
It's cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be central to companies for sending shipments, on the web they will fill in their data about them, i.e. they create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice their use of the service to them for example every month.
Are you now in the project full-time?
It's forcing us, but we're normally on the job so we can feed and develop the project.
We're not backed by a strong multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other one jumped in with more suggestions and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage with us to manage not the Czech market, but who should, with the waiver of the ball, go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is intended to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will be corrected by the second installment, and the solo game in it will be more colourful than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of network wrestling in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using the combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will feature levels focused on just deft movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
To overcome them, therefore, for example, double jumps, running on the walls and a rope slide are essential.
Sometimes, it will be necessary to eliminate enemies as well.
There will also be maps like a maze and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and sow platforms and close massive doors.
You will thus adjust the form of the battlefield.
This should oscillate the pace of the game between furious action and calmer moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We'll play for a foot soldier, Jack Cooper, dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Cooper, at the start of the campaign, together with Captain Lastima, crashes on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there won't be any lenient for him, either.
In addition, Lastimosa takes fatal blows in the crash, and Cooper is therefore tasked with putting the captain's titan into operation.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
Cooper's calls to the titan.
It will serve as a source of information to the players about the soldier's past, but at the same time humorous moments will be created by the robot-decimated communications.
For example, if the titanium is dryly listing all the injuries that Cooper is facing during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was reported by Polygon.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in just two months and Bonusweb will bring you your first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on the 28th. October, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original publishing house remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the publisher THQ, it acquired a number of its brands in 2013 and the right to use both the company's logo and the name.
As a result, Nordic released the likes of Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 more games are being developed for the publishing house, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, while I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I'd known from the start - first she'd obviously been trying to get him around for a long time, then they got back together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she dated a similar one before me.
She went crazy for him.
Her voice even changed in those first days, she had a little girl's, a love-in-chief.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I was watching the whole thing.
He would come home from work at three-thirty at the time, so she always left at three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to make her see him.
Later, I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I ended up always sitting at home.
I could never go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife thoughtfully.
I soon found out that I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted to do.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just a slipper.
At the same time, my neighbors suggested to me that they knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all cracked, it would be bad.
That it would come to everyone in the family, only the daughter suspected something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But I went to his apartment once to see him, saying I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He came with me, and I told him that I had received an anonymous letter saying that he was seeing my wife and that everything was telling.
I asked him what he said.
He stood there, shrugged, stared at the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then, at that time, I also met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me either.
No one told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone out much, who has a hard time meeting someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this and life would go on.
That was not the case.
And I've basically never come to terms with all this.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her often, but in the end I gave it up for the rest.
He lives in the house next door, and I continue to live with her.
It's just rather than my wife my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's hard-working.
I always think she's tried to have no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's good, too.
But sometimes I'd like to pet her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go out for walks and shopping together, and they all think about our happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I'm not enjoying this life.
Even then, when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I was done.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
Following the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists, and the government is calling in for help and the local Muslim minority.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
It also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, with money often coming in forwards inoculated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction more.
But she was soon struck by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation will probably be headed by former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are roughly 2,500 mosques and prayers in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and for several dozen more, they have considered the move.
This week, the German police also intervened against the jihadist clerics.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them ran a space where the faithful allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
It was all hastened by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main challenges - to ensure the funding of mosques from domestic sources, as well as to oversee imams.
But it is not yet clear where he will receive funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One is a special charge for halal food, primarily for meat from slaughter under Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by the sellers of halal food, for the provision of a permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
The allowance of between €10 and €20 could also be paid by the French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them set off from France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, French mosques should feature only preachers who have undergone educational programmes at the universities there.
This should make their sermon compatible with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and others will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and disregard the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
An unidentified gunman was badly injured by his ex-wife on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, the Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man waited in the car outside the mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The crime took place at about 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish Europa Press, the Independent reports that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of the two partners.
Cuffs with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer favours light, well-datribent meals, but we Czechs are rebels and have our tastes and our heads.
So the summer gardens smell like grilled neck, brisket, pork cologne.
Nothing very healthy, nothing very light, still occasionally with the exception of lettuce or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecuing is economical for time and crockery, plus it's a social issue and no one has to be cooped up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make good for the delicacies that make special dining, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or choke at all times.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-adapted grifts are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as the even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even the more time-consuming cooking and the colding of the rice are not being discriminated.
Paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it is up to the cook's imagination how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no kelp like a kelp.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisine dishes today is that the raw materials are usually already commonly available.
Including pickled sweet-and-sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink giard giard has a unique spicy sharp yet delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe by which it is mixed from several vinegar and ginger.
All you have to do is buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with the demonstrable antibacterial effects, which support both digestion and cough or flu resistance, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used mainly in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed banana leaf is widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America, as well as a "help" to prepare a variety of roast, cooked and fried meals that are packed in much the same way as foil.
The banana leaf will then pass on to the dish with a specific flavour.
We can be bought in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut in the shape of wheels.
But select only the leaves of the rich green and therefore healthy - unscathed and unscathed.
The preparation of salad from wakame, sesame and sesame oil is similarly easy.
It can be bought again frozen.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know the kelp of nori in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is made by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - the plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame − a deep green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also fresh and dried and as popular as the kelp nori.
By the way, who doesn't know the mao soup with the wakame, the Asian women supposedly used it for rehearsal from the aftermath of childbirth.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents the graying of the hair and is literally charged with minerals.
Dried and battered wakame also serves as a spice, for example to season with rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to be leached in the water, then rinse, placed in boiling water and cooked for half a minute.
It is then cooled in the icy water, cut out with centre-back rib and continues to be adjusted, perhaps as a favourite salad.
But buying it already finished, frosty, is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to get the roll of the easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled brisket.
Eat healthy, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that delicately combines flavours.
And finished in a one-two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40g carrots, 40g white radish, 100g green asparagus, 60g salad clamps, 60g wakame algae and 60g sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a teaspoon of the sriracha chilli sauce, 20g manga and 40g pickled gizviorh, a little pine nuts.
First, we'll get the rolls ready.
We dip the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, we cook briefly in the hot water with the asparagus shoots, and after about three minutes, let them cool quickly into the icy water to keep them from losing their colour.
Add a vegetable filling on the permitted paper and pack.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which are cut into delicate noodles, mix them with the sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on the rice paper.
Place the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the rolls and at the end finish the whole dish is decorated with a wakame-kilter, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-seat rugby, Fiji's selection takes gold
The impressive performance of the UK in the Seventh Rugby ended with a devastating hitchhike at the last hurdle, Fiji beat the British in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium 43-7.
The Fijians performed a master lesson in processing, a landfill, evasion, a support game, a line-up and a brutal force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with the unseen consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third day on the day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inauguration Olympic Rugby Rugby Olympic tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A win over the South Africans 7-5 in the semi-finals that same day, they may have frozen in the final.
However, Fiji, in his form, would also be beaten by the 15-man team in full health.
It won't be a consolation for the British, but they may rejoice in the fact that at least one of them will have a gold medal around its neck tomorrow: the Fiddijan's lead coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, reflecting the intersections of the British for joy.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a row of buses on the move, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau emerged from the corner.
The timer read for four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, which was a conversion.
12-0 and Britain had a hard time touching the ball.
The brilliant Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only the Fijjans slowed.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown in the right-hand corner and the British trailed 17-0.
Nakarawa added another on his return, and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock ... from the first half.
Vatemao Ravouva then penetrated through the languor Brits and rushed to the line, where he scored.
The conversion to a 29-0 tie was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for the Rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to be handcrafted.
This is exactly what it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime and the surge of the Fijians was stopped... for the full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until after the brilliant interlude of Fijio Tuisov, he went on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, setting a touchdown to the left corner to make it an an an,36-7. But the game had long been won by the Pacific Islanders, and their fans on the stands sang, waved their flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the utterly embroiled approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the Fijans with another attempt to win the Fijans.
There was a whistle, and the Fiddans embraced, and the British fell to the turf completely downholstaged.
Earlier that day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and the UK overcame South Africa in a tight semi-final - one conversion difference.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
The brilliant late dump of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the England 15 team, secured victory - and, in the end, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race were inspired by the coach's battle with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold on these games - and that's a lot to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing breaths to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
Though there were two of them at the mirth, there were three voices in the ship. As the boat whizzed down the surface towards the second Olympic gold in succession in the women's doubles race, the voice of the still-present coach Robin Williams was still in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to have achieved such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, flying on the water's surface with the elegance of the swans - do not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
Behind every gold medal of rowing is the battalion of the auxiliary hands, which, piece by bit, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to see that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I underwent this operation.
Anything could happen without the surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's kind of changing your point of view.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the trio was that he could have started treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, and reduce the blackout to a minimum - if we can call it that way under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together quickly.
That was the suggestion.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, talking less than usual as he tried to manage his own unease.
Stanning, captain of the regimental artillery regiment, who has had a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I've been at rock bottom with emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It reiterates how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked with, and Robin, too.
Up to now it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At most, we were concentrating at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we had no desire to achieve something famous.
We didn't look forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to cheer well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair take a year to think about it before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her husband-to-be is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy that moment.
I didn't want to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took approximately six months in London to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel a lot better about it,' she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says Taximafie hunter Rubeš to the landmark indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are, as reported by TIME, the defendants.
You have made a number of stories in which you have uncovered fraudulent practices as well as those to be in the group that will stand trial.
You faced a few awkward skirmishes with the exposed players because of it.
How much is the report on the indictment of the members of the organized group for you?
I expected there to be a trial.
I'm mainly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail, though.
It's no use.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all the people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
What's enough for me is that some of them are so afraid they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one does a pingla, another delivers a pizza, and one of them completely ditched it.
The defendants can theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the company they took from it.
For a quarter of a century they committed the fact that they were destroying our country's name and stealing from people.
So let them make a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as community service.
Like someone goes to collect garbage, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're going to get probation in the end and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently at the Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of those people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television network Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubeš advises them on the services in Prague rather avoid and what he recommends to use without fear.
Previously he filmed series with the titles How to Do It, City of Scams?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment is referred to as an organized group.
Police followed her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from the Godfather.
They're more about mafiosi - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
Just in guarding each other's relay (the Taxiker's stations).
Prague is all divided.
I found that the main railway station, for example, is not liked with Paris, Pařížská does not like to be with taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lazne (disco club)
Everybody just watches their spot, and each group is kind of organized.
It's obviously a convoluted network.
But the defendants are joined together by only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of the taxi service cheaters are at stake for Prague?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones are still on the street.
I'm talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he rides a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and brings people around.
The last time I rode with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometres.
His police didn't detain for some reason.
They've only picked a few people from the whole big group.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people, therefore, will find it difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague mishap, which seems to have much larger dimensions.
It's no good, of course.
It will help, but all evil is not eradicated, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists appear at the same places you showed in the reports, the Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes, exactly.
They stand in these locations every day and violate the ordinances every day.
It is ignored by both the municipal police and the Prague Municipality.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if it are only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
I must therefore ask: do you feel vindicated?
If I took it as satisfaction, that would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be for the centre of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel like it's a little bit better, I'll continue to do so.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still be doing something to remove him.
You can't be content to do that.
But it's not the case, there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test rides sometimes, and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cabbie, from the same group, by the way, and was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although he then claimed it was the sum of 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cabbie was so cute rude that he was still going to the cops and asking them when someone would finally give him the 56 kroner.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the meter taped the decimal and robbed the tourists of 357 crowns.
Can one say that the insolence of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not back down even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged pointless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
How did the taxi driver claiming him with 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying they could not argue with him at the scene because he had issued a receipt.
And that will be, I think, a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and an ex-official).
There's going to be a cab driver on the one hand with his receipts, on the other hand, the police.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming episodes about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I was just going to use the footage in a story.
Are you concerned that this fact might protect them from the court?
I hope that any judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not be able to make a living.
You spoke of a trick with a decimal, which is being moved especially in front of foreign clients by underwater taxi drivers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried to continue using this trick after the publication of your stories?
I think we have popularised this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving with a cab driver the other day, bragging in front of me that he was the honest cab driver.
But then I noticed that a black cardboard was taped from the side of the meter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
When the fines didn't work for the taxi drivers-frauders, can they be warned by the trial of their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You talked about how you think they'll always find the way to cheat.
I don't think anything can put them off.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I must say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they miss the um.
They don't know how to walk around in it, and they can't say exactly what they'd like.
When they held the demonstration (due to the proposal for a blanket restriction coming from Mayor Adriana Krnáčová's office), it didn't sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they weren't protesting against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it only made for the best possible commercial for Uber.
Overall, how do you evaluate the approach of the Prague Municipality in solving the issue of overcharging fares?
You can see that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole that leaked information, which means the taxi department did its job for several years in a completely unnecessary way.
I hope they'll charge the official to the last check-up of all the thwarted checks to realize what he's done.
That's what I find the worst part of it.
I even went to one of the control runs with him, which I found out only subsequently from their schedule.
It has been several months since the series's last episodes were published.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers, than the most focused series is actually.
I always have friends from abroad here, I play the videos for them.
And then when we walk in the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who can be seen in the footage are really standing there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a fling around them to make people look at them.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
You take a cab when you need to?
All right.
I travel with services where I don't have to pay cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatching stations that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Well, you're brave enough."
Bam in disguise as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were written in 2005.
Former Mayor Pavel Bém set off in the same year for a control ride in disguised as an Italian tourist and on his first attempt the driver cheated him out of two hundred.
But the editor, Rubeš, had worse experience.
The taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from the Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which comes to about CZK 195 per kilometre, as calculated by the report-makers.
The Prague Municipality set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded report: for example, a two-kilometre journey from Pařížská Street to the Beetown cost a tourist 400 crowns.
The expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
They charge even six hundred crowns for the ride to Angel, which has 2.5 kilometres.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Impretrets come out of it well, although sometimes dirt has to be thrown down by a scalpello, it needs to be excreted from the folds.
It's not easy and it doesn't go quickly, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in the Grove approached her work.
Hats off to her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, on which you must climb up and climb down again.
"The restorer should be meticulous, patient, and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
In Frýdlant, this is far from the first restoration work of the company.
Thanks to it, the stone elements of the facade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant town hall were restored, it also restored the statues of St Mary Magdalena in Zátiší, St John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or atplants in the facade of the spa in the New Town under Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine of Rederne began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements of the dirt and crust is being cleaned, the loose stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; either they will be anchored to the wall or to each other.
They are also expected to be treated and preserved by the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
"Then it will start with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure slice gold," said the State Monument Care Officer at the Frýdlant Municipal Office, Věra Sobotová.
There are no records from the past about the tombstone going through any repairs.
On closer inspection, they take the holes drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the tombstone after the decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the raid by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
The headstone was literally sowned, Sobotová noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the restorers are at home with a mild exaggeration.
After the 2010 flood, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were under the water, restored the baptistes, the murals in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would like to get into stained glass in the future as well," Sobotová revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work on the renewal of the redneck tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128,000.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not deposit any of its money into this part of the renewal.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winnings in the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, clarified the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The release of the winnings to restor the tombstone was decided by the trustees.
Experts' views on future developments in selected foreign markets tracked through indexes and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) at a one-month and a half-year horizon.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have said that earlier in the year.
The US S&P500 index, which was undergoing a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high and has already scored 7 percent since the start of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which have so far in the end always achieved their own.
In a situation where US equities are at an all-time high, the volatility that is currently at the lowest since 2014 when markets rose happily and without fear thanks to the US central bank's quantitative easing, and when, as now, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 percent mark.
And not to.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy £70 billion of bonds in the coming months, has also lent up its hand.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing is pushing already so low yields even lower and contributes to the near-total elimination of the risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is undergoing an almost constant growth without major ups and downs, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilising, and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should not be too surprised if US equities continued to hold out in a similarly peaceful regime.
It's a pity Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politician (really experienced, as prolific with so many sorts of transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) has been appointed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU as the European Commission's chief negotiator.
Juncker's selection has been blown out by the prospect of it being in the EU's grave interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media accepted the name Barnier as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a European rock franc.
He hates the Great Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He took it as he could handle it: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon free-market and the model of capitalism.
Advocates of multilateral regulations co-authored the concept of the so-called Banking Union, and he has pushed through legislation with exorbitant financial regulations by the financial sector and services in London.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, relentless and probably reckless negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
In this context, how not to recall the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance sheet, the overview and capacity of the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is also why Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies today.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for everyone's credit!
An earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov from the post of president's office as head of the presidential office on Friday.
His place will be taken over by Anton Vajno.
This was reported by Russian media, citing a report by the Kremlin press service.
Meanwhile, Putin has indicated that Ivanov is being released at his own request.
In a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24, the president said he was reaching out to Ivan's wishes at taking office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the replacement at the head of the president's administration, now led by Ivanov's previous representative, Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
In fact, Ivanov, who is 63, is described as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer has in the past, for example, held the positions of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now also leave the chair of a member of the president's security council.
But Ivanov, in a meeting with Putin, said that the length of remaining at the head of the head of the state's administration was actually a record-breaking record.
He stayed in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its appointment, 11 people have already taken the turn of this role.
Neither Kvitova nor the debs Strýcová and Šafářová will play in the final.
So far, neither of Friday's tennis matches has been converted into a final appearance.
Petra Kvitova lost her fight to the first time, falling to Monica Puig's Puig's Puig in their early stages 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitova was followed by Czech decathlete Šafářivá with Strýcová.
The Williams sisters were reaching for the win in the first set, but they missed two set points and the Russians eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
They lost the second set by 4-6.
The half-goal success rate in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ondřej Synek won his semi-final with a run when he beat the second-seeded Damira Martin from Croatia despite the slowdown in the end by almost a second.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Sonny said.
It was his opponents, unlike him, who had to fight for the advance.
So some of the forces took away, that would make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower of Prague's Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Kpnapková, however, did not follow in Snyka's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower placed fourth in today's semi-final and is in the final and is in the B final and a battle for 7th to 12th place.
Gold from London is not so defended.
For the first time, I didn't make the final at the Olympics.
I'm a little bit sorry, but on the other hand I went to a quality race and I gave it everything I could.
The opponents were simply better, with Topinkova Knapková bowing down in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed she would make the top six at her fourth games.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could move up from that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman for finishing like this.
And I thought I could advance to the final through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, she rode the race of her life today, she said the 2011 world champion.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio, young marksman Filip Nepejchal remained, who failed to make his way out of qualifying for the second time, this time the small-scale in the lie.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the first place with 629 points, and Kirill Grigoryan (628.9) from the second.
The Nepeach shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time in the Rio programme, among them the Czech seven-time women's seven-time women Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cach is ranked 11th after the second event of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is 22nd.
It is led by Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres, as did the second Belgian, Nafissatou Thiam, in the process.
Both took care of the best high-nake performance in the seven-way race.
They tried to jump in 201 centimetres, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Leaving aside the absurdity of the question posed: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
There were dictators in the two great Eurasian peoples in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
Russian Bolsheviks contributed to a large extent to the 94 million victims of communism from 1917 to 1989, which are presented in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis wiped out around 6 million Jews in inhumane fashion, and the total victims of World War II were estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities.
In Germany, not only a few individuals were guilty in Germany or the USSR, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, or just by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not the specifics of these nations alone, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the imminent end of the war came the denacification, the Nuremberg tribunal.
But the most important came later.
When the children grew up, they started asking: Daddy, Grandpa, why did you attend such atrocities?
How could you do that!
This brought real reflection and a healing of society.
Until recently, German elites cared mainly about the country's prosperity, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't care about connecting it back to Alsace-Lorraine or someone - to revanch - to invade - militarily - perhaps anyone will recognize it.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB (sic!)Vladimir Putin officer came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is the revanche, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of their own people are no value for the faithful.
Beat theirs, and they will be afraid of strangers.
I still believe that this is only by those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the rise in tensions around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation has deteriorated on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region.
Who benefits from the growth of tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia were again in a further deterioration.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from both opposing parties are, of course, contradictory and it is difficult to verify independently, and so do we just have the opportunity to think about the old familiar question who is benefiting from?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which is understandably rejected by Ukraine and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provoking.
The information about the arrest of Ukrainian Special Forces members on the territory of Russia came the well-known response from the pilot Savchenko's case that they had allegedly been abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, in what way would Russia benefit from a deterioration in the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only be damaged by Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further reinforcements of sanctions and the intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat of attention to the situation in Ukraine against the backdrop of the immigration crisis in Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has lost its credit to its residents when President Poroshenko's current support is around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrupt long ago if it had not been for the EU's generous financial injections and, most importantly, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs once again to crack attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
Once again, President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the power forces want to prove to be strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia as well.
It is to be hoped that all those who attempt to spark an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but all the ordinary people on the two rival sides and will stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (as of June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.0%, i.e. a.m. monthly inflation rate of 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% as of July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, a rise in the travel of the following groups of consumer goods was recorded in July 2016: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained on the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
The US Secret Service is said to have been following the hacking attacks of the Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks became public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was looking into an attack on the servers of the Democrats' party headquarters.
Russia's involvement in the attack, however, is not mentioned in any official report.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The news of the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret because it was leaked that the U.S. Secret Service was monitoring the hacking attack and could also be detected by the way they do it and what sources they use.
The attacking action was said to have involved two Russian intelligence services.
New Advisory Council for Cybersecurity
The material to track the Russian trail was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress called the gang of eight in the US were informed of public officials, called the gang of eight in the US.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell, and Paul Ryan, the Democratic leaders in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional conscription and security committees.
The incumbent Democratic Party leader, Donna Brazile, announced on Thursday that she was creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for Democratic Party servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Albert.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's complaint for health problems after eating food, the wild-smoked salmon - bits 100g, the expiration date 22.11.2016, the Prague Hygienists carried out a check at the Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption on 22.11.2016, to which the customer pointed out, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammalian mammals.
This is a danger to humans - the larvae in the body cavity or the musculature of the fish are a strong allergen and human-gained live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We are very much apologetic to customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, as a precaution, we withdrew all other batches of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the part of the supplier we are in negotiations with, and at the same time we had this product tested for ourselves, Alberto spokesperson Barbora Vanko told News.
If the customer has bought this product, he can return it at any of the chain's shops and get the money back.
The larvae will be destroyed by frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - the Grievers.
The presence of the dangerous product was reported by the hygienists to the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration.
According to the server, the free-lifefreepotravin.cz people after ingesting the parasite can become ill with anisacosis, which manifests itself in violent abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can take place asymptomatically, the Czech News Agency reported.
The symposiums will be delivered for an hour to two weeks after the consumption of an undercooked infected fish.
Three weeks after the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, so they are killed with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or to freeze it.
Veterinarians have also currently examined the salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had the parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic in early April, according to the State Veterinary Administration (JRC).
Expanded, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, to date there have been 919 packs.
The product's unsold stock is currently being withdrawn from the stores, JRC spokesperson Petr Pejchal told the Czech Press Agency on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after the discovery of the positive samples banned the sending of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, killed by a Russian airstrike.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to the jihadist who was soon killed, it came to a sobrizzle.
The expected paradise of the Caliphate was transformed for British girls into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister, Hali, according to relatives.
She called her Britain repeatedly and confided that she wanted to go back home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot indiscriminately, The Telegraph quotes the lawyer for the late girl's family, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Raqqa, where the girl made her last call.
Then came the news of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in east London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There, they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house she was staying was razed to the ground in May, the British ITV News reported.
The network added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) thought about fleeing Islamic State territory, one Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to the available information, she was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it (Kadiza) as a warning and decided not to take any risks, she means, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas set out on the road to the 17th. February last year.
At home, all they said was that they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything they could, tensed to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking them being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that the fate of Kadiza may serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many instances of people going there, realizing how things are there, they understood how much different it is from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is unknown.
But as they have also fallen silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the community of Inveraray was the county centre and the seat of the Duke of Argyl.
Since the mid-18th century, courts have been held at the town hall, and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts dwelt were plaintive, and many inmates tried to escape.
A lot of them also successfully.
That's why the city's representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it had not been in operation for a long time, with the closure for economic reasons as early as the end of August 1889, as the smaller correctional facilities were costly for operation and not paying much.
Stories of the convicts and the hunt for the ghosts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, with visitors able to compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed.
The guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also an apprehension room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking the fingers or burning the plates to the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be confined to one of the cells, mostly for a souvenir photo, or to create a feeling experienced behind bars by the prisoners.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of Scotland's most famous sites, where it is allegedly haunted.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some spirits.
Such a night, however, will cost £300, which is roughly £9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The 'Animé' effect on Snapchat is criticised as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the animated ones, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, the Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identities in ways that border on the absurd.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to have stepped out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any mistake will be made public immediately.
Snapchat filters have come in for criticism in the past, accusing the app promoting blackfacing or supporting white shades of skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that gave the users their eyes slanted, their teeth twisted teeth and the puffed cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow-face."
And they asked whether these repeated contentious issues point to a larger problem for society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the novelty and indignation quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day that he had cancelled the job.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a show the accounts to the characters of the Animals, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes of action.
Others, without wrapping, were declined to compare with the animations.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least, harmful and embarrassing."
She added that it was "it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface) but that the yellow face is dragged into a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only society that has crossed these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the boardrooms in the corporations to Holywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some users," Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday, "it's just very hard to go unnoticed today, as it used to."
Katie Zhu, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said she believed that racially motivated problems were reflected by the lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white, completely male management, and ended the article with the hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity among the employees, and the colorful people at the moment when these things are decided," said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American origin, "or colored people work there, but not in positions to make them feel safe or pleasant to speak out."
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not disclose the numbers relating to the diversity of its employees, stating that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruitment officer to focus on the under-represented population and the internal management of inclusion.
Zhu adds, "I wonder if they really need more such users who can say that it's not okay," saying that it would be kept shut down.
Army officers distorted intelligence about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report issued Thursday that officers from the United States' central headquarters were changing intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events provided from the country.
According to a preliminary report by the working group, compiled by the Republican chairman of the Committee on the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Subcommittee, "distinctive discontent" was found among Central Intelligence Agency analysts, according to which their superiors changed their assessments of US efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the CentCom, is an army central in Tampa, Florida, overseen by U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report reads: "The intelligence outputs approved by Centcom's senior officers usually offered a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism efforts than those confirmed by the facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than those obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened on the Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when a flawed analysis is presented to the superior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure to run Centcom goes back to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report detail the central staff's persistent problems in describing and analysing American efforts to train the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that the Obama administration's top officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that the analysts felt that they were under pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Staff's press releases, statements and congressional statements were considerably more positive than what the events were," the report reads.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Representative Mike Pompeo, the Republican Republican Party's representative from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence personnel of the US Central Central Staff's intelligence services manipulated the outputs of the staff's intelligence services in order to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released on Thursday must be followed by further investigation into further investigation.
There is yet another investigation conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in the research services of the Centcom.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the Republican working group's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very narrow process for compiling an evaluation of IS and the security services of IS," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Committee and the representative of the Democrats.
In Adam Schiff's words, the process "managed to distort the output of the intelligence services," it damaged morale among analysts and "insufficiently taken into account disapproving views."
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to press the Centcom to adjust their conclusions to "a draft or political situation."
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general that was opened following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General's investigation was still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of the comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental national security issues."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the bombing led by the bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (the statement now declaring a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations have raised question marks about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis sites.
Criticism of the coverage of the Islamic State has been hailing the conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research work that said President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to reflecting on what would be followed by the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposing the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the air strikes conducted against the Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's financial resources because the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been made outside the central staff.
Centcom commander, gene. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized for the past year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony to an over-reporting of war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by a gene at Centcom. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. side won in the field hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today the deciding game will be played on the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three goals in the match against Japan, which ended in a 6-1 victory, and scored the first two goals of the game just a day later for the American women's team in the game, in which America beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she was not sure if she ever did such a thing.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who writes their goalposts.
But he knows this: The American's lead to 4-0 at the Olympic tournament and shares the top spot in the group with the UK, who remained unbeaten on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat.
The UK and the United States will face the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide who from the group of six teams will finish in first place and who in second place.
The first-place team will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the top of the second group, a little longer.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans caused a stir with their surprise ride, four years after finishing between the 12 teams at the London Games.
There was Bam on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took her hockey stick for field hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older sisters played twins in Drexelu) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics eluded her because she did not make it to the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither her nor the members of her team were doing so well.
The next year, the Englandaster Craig Parnham was appointed as coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the pace of our work to do today in London.
We made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bamova started in the first half by scoring a goal with a bekenda from close proximity.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the field, then slipped into the middle and scored the ball to get the American into a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three victories, was the first ever tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rampage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro make you feel the persistent, indescribable and biased rotation of competition and effort.
It is how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay stake handed over from the lustre swimmer, gymnast and the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor's interview in the café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Closem.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the women's upcoming darling with dimples in her face, is at the Olympics for the first time, and he could also be among those whose names will be heard in prime-time homes between the sponsor's commercials and spots if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California, is vying for Olympic gold in the trampoline jumping.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine at all competitions the same way.
Farther from the center, a little in the shadows are sports that are not universally recognized: air-lift gunfire, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although jumping at the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since they were first introduced at the Sydney Games in 2000, the sport remains almost unnoticed after 16 years of interventions - many of the people I have asked, who I have not even known it was an Olympic sport.
It may be regional indifference.
The USA has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
The awards in the men's category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be huging Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
But the trampoline jumps are yet to be unlucky, partly because the uninitiated's ear will seem more likely to be more suited to the clown university than the Olympics.
I must confess that I am not an expert, but merely an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has a comic potential - comic-book vibration of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampolín" which means "jumper board."
The inspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of up to almost 10 meters and perform kits with several elements (saltos, screws and combinations) before they finally land on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are judged by design, difficulty and "about in the air."
In Rio, there will be a competition for 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The gold medalists must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He is trying to catch up with not only the finish line or the starting wall, but, as television news reports, another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is classy, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline brings relief in this respect.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces as if they were in a state of weightless like astronauts, they go up, then down, then back to effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is impossible, but for the duration of the set-up there will be no furious struggle to achieve the goal, no distance aura, but only a perfect, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
This is just the closest thing to the Olympics and the zen coming closer.
The women's qualification and final takes place on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and the men's competition at the same time on Saturday.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the afternoon block, which starts both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise calm, pleasant moments you'll probably miss through the other fights.
And if the only way to get attention is that male athletes are the subject of in love-minded and materialized - as the US Gymnasium recently proposed, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is merely waiting for his new fans to gasp.
'Protesting Generations' in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during the clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major policy changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say officers shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
The circulating videos of protests, which probably come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, are captured by members of the security forces beating young people with their sticks after being forced to stand against the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and take a step forward will be even harder to do," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project leader for the International Crisis Group's research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to remove the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of the African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy was at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved substantially - a new suburban train is even running in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia is hardly called a model of democracy - the human rights organization talks uncontozes about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that may change.
"When you choke people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all young people.
Protests a whole generation.
There are many complaints, and they relate to everything from disputes over land to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting at the Eritrea border. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anyliters fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogadn National Liberation Front, may try to harness and rearm.
There are several factors explaining why, after years of smoltings beneath the surface, these bitter sensations have now flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social networks for the past few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And while the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is normally the case primarily during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they were gathering for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromy and the Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhar are not natural allies.
Over the long centuries, the Amhur, largely from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and commerce, using the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on our way to a unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the Oromo leader.
The biggest protests were in the areas inhabited by Amhary and Oromy.
Many Amhar and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigrai, which make up around 6 percent of the population and control the military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unsafe disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterfully able to uncover the initial signals of discontent, and used emissaries to process opponents and take sides.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," Abdi, an analyst at the conflict, said.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative unfamiliarity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrai region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tigres-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be a further shedding of blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005 after thousands of people protesting what analysts described as an election that the government screwed up and then stolen.
This was followed by a crackdown in which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in the past few months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual rise in controversy within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the amgarian city of Gondar attacked Tigrejci-owned business firms, and a social media grudge against Tigres were becoming more common.
Analysts say he puts the protests in the uncomfortable situation of the US and other Western allies.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base had been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to disintegrate in an already volatile area.
"It's that," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as a "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to downplay the latest controversy that is flooding his campaign by stating that he didn't mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to speak clearly to the US public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who have defended him strugglingly in the tumultuous times and have to explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
Following this motion at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he had indeed not intended to say that the President and H. Clinton created the IS.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was merely sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of a claim the old day just one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio anchor Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's remark by commuting by saying that Obama was seeking to destroy IS, the Republican nominee did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump attempted to focus his campaign attention on the economy, while his preferences in the polls are down.
Trump and Clinton participated in Michigan this week's duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the subject.
He warned on Twitter again that Clinton's proposals were linked to a tax increase, saying that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he drew a wave of criticism when he came forward with the suggestion that the Russians should go through to Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remark, saying, "I am sarcastic, of course."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and temper them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some of the messages have a response from his supporters to see how they react, and, according to the response, then "given the explanation" in one or other way, said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language the two candidates used.
But I also think he is deft in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be able to explain them in different ways.
As the poll results in his favor continue to decline, Trump has adopted an even more snide tone in recent days, instead of teasing things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump is behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind in Florida.
Trump is even attempting to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he calls, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpretations of his words or misunderstanding his sense of humour.
But with Trump facing increased attention in the closing months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put Trump's jokes in the awkward position of his devoted followers, who must publicly stand behind him, however provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani, when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that it quite wrongly called a newcomer. And it came about because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are attempting to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed IS to be rampant and unable to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to be on Twitter about the fire on the media for mourning his every word and being biased to him.
Laughing at the "pleasement, pathetic" TV scholars who are trying to understand him, and said, "They can't do it!"
Several Democrats have grimlaged Trump's apology, saying it was just further evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
The café was pushed out of the market by prices. He is now returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop replaced by Verb in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of the burgeoning city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: 'New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel was plundered and the Verb shop is now a soap.'
But if New York is a change, it is also rediscover.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and receives credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The new Verbo's manager is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café who is also the owner and managing director of the new post.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to the new job, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb still has the same baking trapper and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even used the lighting from the old Verbe again.
Rodriguez, however, said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese and toppings, such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of the original regulars.
"Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg for the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, one of these customers, Rebecca Oliveira, was here.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
She even came after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I love was coffee and culture in the Verbo," she said.
Now he drinks his coffee again, but on that day she took a mixed chai, another novelty, instead of her usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been touring with Verb since 2003.
He comes before work and always orders the same thing.
"At a quarter and eight I come here every day, like clockwork, and they're already preparing my bagel with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but occasionally he lets bacon, eggs and a ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry that the soap deal had taken his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it on display soon so his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juic producer wants to bottle and sell the filtered coffee.
It offers the possibility of extending the café to the neighbouring building.
It is enough for many customers to get their old favourite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopened, walk in and have coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressing food from the time of the crisis - in the "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the presidency in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and was having lunch.
The ladder was enjoyed by President Roosevelt on selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose jade pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: an evil-style egg in a rag of tomato sauce, potato puree, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of cookery solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, devote themselves to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane tells the life story of a residential building on the Lower East Side through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new joint work "A Square Meal," published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed cooking solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a meatloaf-carried olive sandwich, Andrew (57) had a turkey, a mash potato and a mixed vegetable.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which, according to the couple, was well suited to the conversation about food during the crisis.
"The Arabs were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
It was sold for peanut, liver and bean meatball.
They were made from that admixture and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Transform a number of peeys you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grimaced.
"They'd lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet to eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly baked cake.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" follows the ways the nation has dealt with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said by explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: mysterious foods were expanded, such as meatballs and dish of castrides, as "an amazing way to use the leftovers," Ziegelman remarked, as the chefs could hide non-aesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - the focal point of American food for years - has become an economical luxury.
Strange mixtures that were to serve as a caloric and nutritional filler preferred to taste or even common sense in cooking.
During the book exploring the recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared period food from a roasted onion filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with roasted onions doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
Thus, as never before and never after, the domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the shrush of the federal office of the domestic economy from 1923 to 1943 - directed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take the reins of the budget, and went, like cream spaghetti and carrots, converted into tasty meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
The desserts, in particular, were created in the government's response to its hungry citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's pose "I'm a pie."
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmer's cuisine of his childhood, he dined as the chosen millionaire he had become.
"He was happy to eat continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not prompted him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells me, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the taste. This led to the White House being "not just served almost the most buried food in all of Washington, but also in the most dismal-hunt fashion."
A number of food habits from the crisis subsided as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that during the book's writing, they understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She was sick of her people."
There was an accident with wreaths.
When Eisenberg's clean tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"He's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly plunged the spoon into the thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew added Coe, and then again.
And, as a good treasurer, he told his wife, "A little chopped-up walnut would be good."

Most of the refugees who are coming to Europe come for economic reasons.

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the patent against hepatitis C against the Merck
The district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of the fees for the lawyers it was incurred in the process of patenting the hepatitis C against the mercenary manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a conviction was overturned to pay Gilead for damages for breach of two Merck's two patents in connection with the highly successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge had repeatedly found an illegal act on the part of Merck, including a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in the file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to waive the fees that arose in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation anti-limb hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates from 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead drugs.
US-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the border with Turkey, after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians who were being held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij Military Council of the Manbija military council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday on Friday, stating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had received $10.75 million in revenue in the year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed a nearly $5.3 million fee to the joint coffers for lectures, and the former secretary of state awarded an income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on his time at the State Department.
The Clintons' co-candidate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, has released 10 years' tax returns.
They paid the actual tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, who helped the Clinton campaign, said in a statement.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers credered the Treasury's tax department's audit of the US Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to disclose the tax returns.
"Your move," campaign avenue Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, following on the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, who include the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney and other Republican party members, he agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charity, business transaction contributions, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is prominent on the issue, posting a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking republicanship on Trump is urging to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, raise the question in your speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidency have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said to the people.
Politico reported that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the past two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times columnist has quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim, which may be the case today.
The federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that all those who make more than $1 million in a year pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffet's conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway, called for a meeting and exchanged tax returns for Trump.
Buffett said he had also received an IRS audit, and that Trump was "not "unfailure" to the IRS, but for voters.
Clinton's campaign was published back in return until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, their wages are only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund from which the Clintons gave income in dividends and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to people's homes - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This practice has worked well, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this procedure and is training volunteers in the villages of Tanzania, how to use this nonviolent advance in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since they developed them this ... set of tools, we have noted a change in the behavior of these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them," Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps is to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and lower the horn.
If this does not deter him, it will be for the so-called "chickel" to be thrown out.
The chili powder mixed with the salt is wrapped in a condom with the firecracker, its end choked to look out of it only by the wick.
After detonation, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chilli is scattered into the air.
Usually one whiff is enough for the elephant to go in a different direction.
The last option is to launch a fireworks display that will provoke a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel to "request" of Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish descent caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol in Berlin did not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee's words on the basis of an Arab client's "demand."
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah," aired his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel in the hotel's list of phone calls codes.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel via its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and addressed the problem at the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, in his words, was "shocking."
The hotel staff replied that the measure had been ‘determined at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels’.
The reason for this move was further irritated by the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that Israel's call code be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the employees as saying in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great embarrassment."
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
On its own, it's a huge embarrassment.
The fact that this has happened in Germany, and in such a hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
There is no further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply "lost" its claims from Arab customers.
"Shame on you," reads another post, which points out that the hotel, located in the classy Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel daily, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the event a "overlookout" and "recognizing" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has been issued" to include Israel in the list of call codes, Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in San Paul, Brazil, on Thursday when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government riot police tried to disperse the students, which ended with police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of Sano's governor, Paul Governor Gerald Alckmin, in order to save money, is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spray-painting inscriptions against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after the demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover rose by 70.9 percent year-on-year, following the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that do business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the top priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to reach $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to the amount of $158 million.
The jump in trade has been provided by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
The Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to be visited by a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Over the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas, mostly travelers, to the citizens of Iran.
In addition, Iran made it to the top 20 countries for the first time, according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes there will be a change.
"Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the preserved monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner rushes home after Britons won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome when the trio of the VB team defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was in the brake role taken by the Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man was delighted with the legatee of the goal and stole the victory from the hands of the favoured New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing the modest sixth at the world track-side championship in track cycling in March, although Hoy's career in the meantime ended.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialist opener Jamie Staff.
So the Hindes appeared just in time.
After Hoye's departure, there was also a vacancy that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to fill in.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the potential search has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who, along with Hoy, was champion four years ago - and Skinner achieved an Olympic record in qualifying, but took the leotard in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
The Hindes were slightly behind on his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a large part of the transformation, with the Hindes going to a higher gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took to the podium, he kept his eyes on them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and we beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell to the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the remake and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
The Hindes said, "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We have lost in a number of world races, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we are facing a successful five days for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny's performance, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
This would then be the birthday of 23 March for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is now 12 years younger than Hoy (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, and on this day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) also celebrates his birthday) - marked a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Still, how much he got for Hoy.
Next up, Kenny will be taking part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this one now.
The team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for myself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race that day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the team pursuit at the four-kilometer team.
They ended up with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:55.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) are held in today's second day of the race, which will surely be the focus of Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the judges called for him to measure the height.
In a similar women's race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trotto, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-range of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances showing the absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced in their preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of the greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the Great Britain team can deliver a top-of-the-range performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of the Melbourne in Portland after the termination of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and which informed the melter-based electricity contract of the intention of one of the owners of the melting plant. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be trunbtedly.
This is the move following the one that the government of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the provision of subsidies that keep the business running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk for up to 2,000 jobs.
Closed up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk.
And because the smoky consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, additional avalanche impacts can occur.
Alcoa closed the Torch of Point Henry in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
Alcoa's tavire at the company in Portland is unprofitable and in danger of being closed.
The move follows several years of speculation about the future of the business, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently for plant production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley, the AGL, said it expected one of the other three owners to decide to terminate the contract as well.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holding the small shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to work, in other words, that the deforestation demand for electricity from the smashing from the smashing will continue," she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "surance contracts" that were supposed to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017," the plant said.
Furthermore, any potential impact on AGL profits since the 2018 fiscal year is currently limited due to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its books of $187 million "in case the closure takes place."
Alcoa stated that the contract's decision to terminate "does not have an impact on its ... the ability to operate a smulter or to secure the electricity supply to the smasher."
The American company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 to start in November of this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland Tearers in Victoria as well as the Tomago plant near Newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector.
AGL Operations Manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these firms were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand in the [electricity energy] market.
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real TV show - now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan's mother-manager, appeared on the cover of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the band's ambassador for Estee Lauder, who was on Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page, Kendall wants to cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply a sequel to the Kardashian's humoreanes?) with a video of the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (binary rioters Rob and Caitly, and along with all the popular showbiz uncle, Keep Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister's cover, only so the scene could end with a classic turn: they're setting up a secret party.
It's a bygone story line for almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we've forgotten about you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the eight o'clock in the morning, but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could get fed up on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we've definitely entered the new era of the Kardashian.
The older sister, Kim, may have pushed Kendall to the cover of Vogue (she was co-written with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the magazine's September issue is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling figure of the year.
The release, which in its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that of the 832 pages in last year's edition, 615 pages with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star appearing on the cover page is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that the magazine's pictures have been leaked in the past two years before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the front page has certainly shown more "celebrities that make models" than "models who are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner and Dior ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, and Laga Gaga was honoured a year later.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as the "prickom model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, nor are the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today, who know how to make a well-schedened video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel at the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
In June, Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the girls of the moment."
These feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's doing it for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she performs on a reality show, perhaps only as one way to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people a year
The more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in the community's legal aid centres, and they are poised for the effects in the sector itself, with further caps on the overloaded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, at-risk workers, victims of violence, and people with no financial means to fight an unjust eviction and the like - are already being rejected when they are looking for free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to bursting points, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Centres, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision to abhor, the situation would be getting worse.
"Commun-regime legal centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being refused the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relations with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families passing through the separation, the workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more at-risk people from Queensland having to navigate the complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator of the Queensland, George Brandis, to prevent this shortening of funds immediately, to get people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Over the past year, the government of the state has honoured its commitment to secure funding for legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and communities of their clients, and the Palaszczczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign suit after staff member allegedly pointed to gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February pointed a gun at a crew member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a court case file handed to Vincent Bordini, a former campaign campaign coinner in the state court in Charlotte, on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he had concluded that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "claimed the gun with his fingers, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini found, following a complaint to the campaign's local and regional leadership, that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"The weapons do not have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused upsement when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and holders could take action (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment) if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could appoint her judges.
Trump's campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not defended the violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, the unlawful use of violence and the cause of emotional harm.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the report requesting comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news bulletin in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consultancy Innovative Consulting Services was not responded to in a short time.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is campaigning for controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is in a tremendous way attractive, just as London 2012 was when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games have posed huge benefits for both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching posts, 40,000 new jobs and we will put an end to the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the Heathrow case, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave for a history of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that, on the deadline and with the budget set out, introduced an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, starting with the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, after the T2 Terminal, which was built between the two of the world's bragliest runways.
They are now prepared to deliver the third runway, which is backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK and I believe that the Heathrow to be the one to be.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, to secure trading for the future, and to leave a legacy of skill and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Minister of Finance's Business Affairs.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game of cat and mouse in the ad-clearance
Attempts to bypass advertising-blocking programs have become a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that program such software says.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would be blocking advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users could update the filters in their program and re-dauthor advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around the ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
Adblock, however, now claims to have already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock's spokesman, Ben Williams, wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source community of blocking ads and those who are trying to bypass them has been insisting since the blocking of the ads was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another repair of its own.
The fact that the company owning the world's largest social networking in the war is merely proving to see how much of a problem blocking ads for industry has become.
According to the study, the tkerou was conducted by Pagefair and Adobe used by advertising filters worldwide worldwide - almost four times the case in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of advertising profits on Facebook, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook every day from mobile devices.
The spokesman said the company, however, was going against advertising filters on desktops, because the mobile filters of mobile advertising for mobile apps for the social networking site and Instagram do not work.
Advertisements for desktops still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it would update the "ad preferences" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how ads are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were a concern to them because they could also block content on the site that is not related to the ad.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Blocking ads is an insensitive tool, which is why we preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by Swiss motorway car
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to the event in which a woman was run over on the highway in the early hours of Thursday morning on the highway by a woman who had probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near the Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and ran over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but police say they still haven't all been identified. Police are urging these drivers and all the others who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, said the attorney, Gilles Hofstetter, to Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This is what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases from the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the paper said.
Last year, a police officer was cleared for vehicular manslaughter after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, was drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - had ridden in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident that occurred at the Morges should come forward to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (ACC) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the ACC's Executive Director, Kateřina Petříčková, said so.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on 8 August, with the festival bringing to light the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) film.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular LGBT community destinations, for the high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialised enterprises," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign festival-goers spend an average of CZK 3100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague's gay and gay-friendly bar, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The festival programme also hosts the first Pride Tourism Symposium this year.
It is leaked by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday 14 August.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade with allegorical cars on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The procession, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will this year observe a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the assailant shot dead 49 people, predominantly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are celebrating 40 years.
The unreplafting handymen Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series, director Lubomír Beneš, premiered on August 12, 1976.
The creation of this animated series, now known by audiences in more than 100 countries around the world, were cartoons of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two handymen of Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Culadas.
Today's likeness, with a yellow and red trick and a radial, was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the DIY in 1985, this time it was shot directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other episodes were produced.
After his death in 1995, more episodes continued with other creators, many of whom were co-written by Beneš's son Marek.
There are now over ninety episodes with stories of these handymen, which are sprinkled up under their hands, but they are never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs, and to the theat theaters, and the characters, or other toys with the depiction of the Pat and Mata, are a hit for any toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen one sporting and one of your lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's go see.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what are the most things people spend on airports?
This is Friday's review from the world's websites.
First Olympic Games medal.
The historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The Rugby selection of this archipelago was beaten by the UK team of the 19th rugby team in the final of the Olympic Rugby tournament.
It is the first ever medal to win for Fiji at the Olympics.
Waiting to win the first valuable metal took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games was sent.
Much of the credit for the success goes to coach Fiji.
Ironically, however, he is the Brit Ben Ryan.
He has led the team since 2013, and after the final as a British citizen, he could be happy, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play freely and easily and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated him in general, and the small state of 900,000-seekers is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs since 11 months.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll's arms and legs and then sit together without prostheses.
Morning was diagnosed with meningitis B in less than a year of life, with doctors giving it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
He has a perspective.
I've seen her introduce herself to other children with the words Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has attracted.
What's the most we spend at the airport?
CNN provides a finding that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel extras essential stores have released data over the past year, summing up the 10 products that customers buy most often in its stores at airports.
The water was supremely first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M sweets with coconut flavour.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
You can't eat the only one of the above things.
CNN says it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: the New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines, it's US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have been reigning the category of two without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing the competition since 2009.
On the lagoon, Rodrigo de Freitas, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
What are we different from the others?
We are simply nicer, joked Murray during the Olympic regsen when he was asked to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a six-foot-tall and 100-killoan chaser, the academically-looking Bond is five centimetres shorter and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and is in finance, with Murray, for example, having a charity boxing match.
It also makes them don't spend much time out of rowing.
Eric gets on the boat basically saying we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference demonstrated that Murray is dominant in the crew.
It was he who was the first to answer, and Bond waited for his chance.
On the water, however, they destroy their opponents with calm force.
They are riding their pace, and while they are often still in the lead halfway through the track, the opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometre course and we never wanted to go the first kilometre to the edge.
We're just trying to ride a pace that no one else can do.
We know what we have to do to win, said the 34-year-old Murray.
With his partner's four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the Golden Four were without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to switch to a 2 without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they made up for the biggest defeat of their careers, and they also confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do, and they didn't ask questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a lot of time, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know that everyone wants to overthrow us from the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we are trying to be half a step in front of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for the Study of Space developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate science researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated with CO2, conditions could have prevailed similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's low-level rotation rate can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once took to boast a sparse Earth-like atmosphere, turning slowly.
The model also looked at the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet's areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic diversity on it to have life in the right and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus also used the sun, which was 30 percent more muted.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during the slow rotation, he exposes his day side to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the formation of the rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and shield the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than they are currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus, a similar evolution to which was hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although the Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and the water vapour was burned with ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen leaked, leaving only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the lethal effect of the greenhouse gas -- that's the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday for the Colorado Avalanche team, citing the impossibility of participating in the decision-making process on team issues.
Colorado's executive vice president/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"I've been head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche for the past three years, with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50.
I have been thinking long and intensely during the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations is in line with the organization's vision.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for the team's contributions.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win with Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a gain of 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division. Colorado, however, faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and during the last two years, his games each season failed to make it.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39-4 in the 2015/2016 season and was five points away from winning a second wildcard in the Western Conference.
Goalie Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil rig resume talks and suspend strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties said the strike over wages for the North Sea oil rig workers were suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field services company sporadically took place on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to address the current disagreements," the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day-long gatherings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest at wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid out about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for offshore companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company the leeway to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to abandon operations in the field of oil and gas as far as 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the low oil prices, the economic situation linked to Britain's decision in June to leave the European Union.
A member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disagreements of an entire generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that operates for all, not just for some," he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be made in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation rate in Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of star rotations from the Roast Campettop.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster revolve at different speeds, as well as how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more by comparing our results with other star clusters about the relationship between star material, its age and even history in its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a research fellow at the center of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a new report.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now reaching a state of adulthood and have been around for over 125 million years.
Now it is turning the fastest.
At the moments of maximum rotation, these teenage stars release vast amounts of stellar winds.
Because these winds move along the star's magnetic fields, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the star getting older, her turning rate slows down.
Kepler measures each star's rotation rate by measuring the time between discovering distinguishing points on the stars -- similar to the sun's spots.
According to the latest data on the rotation speeds, the larger stars rotate more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the bigger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "bath" of the Pleiad, we see that the slower spinning stars are more massive, while the quickest ones are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"The fiets provide an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot of what we want to learn about how, when, when and why the stars slow down their rotation rate and, to say, "hang out their nail dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the speed of the Pleiad rotation in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement would not be closed and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without signing up for specialized education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy for a job only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about six months there could be a vacancy in another place where I would like to work afterwards.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about that six months, the inquiry continues.

No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the recovery of the costs incurred in the increase or deepening of the employee's qualifications.
In the health sector, there is long-term pressure to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the occupational mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Under Law No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence to practise the health profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, while it is explicitly the case that participation in specialisation training is considered to be a deepening of the qualification (not as an increase in it).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or provide for an obligation to apply for specialisation training.
The Act only lays down the conditions of an application for inclusion in the field of specialisation training.
However, the doctor is legally entitled to pursue the profession of doctor by the law by taking the necessary university studies, albeit under the conditions of the statutory prescribed conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with a specialised capacity in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where a specialist experience completed in another field of specialisation may be counted in the specialisation of the doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant education programme.
In theory, it would be possible to factor in the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is possible to recommend consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Science and Medical Occupations Department), as the Ministry of Health provides by law a consultancy and consultation related to the classification in and running the training.
The consultancy service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab are requesting the US intervention.
The United States has not made any efforts to end the siege (the city's reigns of government troops) and did not use its influence to promote the protection of civilians, AFP quoted from a letter to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over the eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not re-enclosed," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the military loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours to allow safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9 a.m. to 12:00 GMT, all military activities, aerial attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
The head of UN humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, welcomed this, but stressed the need for at least a two-day truce.
The letter to Obama, according to AFP, was approached by 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of Halab, which are controlled by the rebels.
It writes that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of the countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world watches and notes how complex Syria is, but is doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly veiled threats, said pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said that in the past month, 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria have been recorded, including 15 at the hospitals they work.
We are most saddened by the fact that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have young children coming to the emergency room with injuries so serious that we have to choose between them the ones most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the blast cut off oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They gasped for breath, and then their lives were over - before he could actually begin, they reminded them.
In the past weeks, the military loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russian forces, has encircled the rebels in the eastern part of Halab, with over 200,000 people indoors without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes from the Russian and Syrian Air Force, managed to break the encirclement after three weeks on Saturday and launch a counter-offensive.
Both sides were then added to the city and its environs.
