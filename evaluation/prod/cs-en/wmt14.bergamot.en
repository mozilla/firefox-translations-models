Economia and the Centre connect management.
They will offer, for example, a joint advertisement
Economia's new integrated newsroom in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken another step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
As of Friday, Economia and the Centre have joint top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," comments the changes made by Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and commissioned CEO Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings, Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the business, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová, is also subordinate.
The new head of information technology was Stephen Burda.
The joint director of the editorials is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team includes the director for the transformation, Jakub Unger.
The newly established role of marketing director was commissioned by Adéla Pitts.
A separate corporate communications department is now run by Věra Lhotská.
The joint finance director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will, among other things, enable us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the production of content of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, which is owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this year.
The Centrum Holdings Portfolio consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, the web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto, or a portfolio of nearly two dozen other smaller websites.
The company Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly Respekt and the Economist and a number of printed B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base close to the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported the story.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the attack on it was not confirmed by the Israeli government.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli military, when asked by CNN, declined to comment on the information about the raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli raid, according to a US government source, was missiles and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of an Israeli raid on a target on Syrian territory was Russian missiles SA-125.
A second channel on Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
But satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to DPA.
In addition, they said they showed a battery of missiles SA-3, including a radar-seeker-seeking command center for missile tracking and their targets.
The recorded missiles have a range of 35 kilometers, according to an Israeli television report, and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to have to hit any shipment of weapons destined for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a night-time interview to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after ten years in a leadership position, Mr. Blair has mostly avoided interviews about British politics, confining his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the White-Ooddly Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his reply from the London-based Evening Standard quoted as follows: "Yes, of course, but that's hardly the case, is it, so..."
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport for shooting
Shots were fired at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly a terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, says the law enforcement officers shot dead a rifle of an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to police, reported that there had been a shootout that injured two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration.
How many people have been injured in total and whether there are any victims but it is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
Berdych and Stepanek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
For the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players, Jaroslav Navratil, nominated the four-player Tomáš Berdych, Radek Stepanek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech national team defends the trophy, but are going to play on the pitch of their opponents in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, that it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Brno observatory takes visitors to space in the new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the great planetarium's hall has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sink into the new comfortable seats and overhead a projection area with a diameter of 17 metres in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the hall walls.
"This is twenty-one computers that generate the image," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno observatory.
Computers will ensure that the image of several projectors does not overlap, but gives a coherent impression.
"Computer performance is thirty to 40 times higher than for classic personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
The Digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body, or the bottom of the ocean.
Viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a person.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen the purchased shows and their own productions in the hall.
There have been two shows on the agenda since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is for adults.
In it, people learn about the astronaut training, go out into space, turn into centrifuza, and then see, on graphic examples, the challenging conditions of astronauts in space face.
The second show is for children and is called Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the eruption of a nearby volcano.
The entire digitarium cost roughly fifty million crowns, which was paid for mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory from its budget also contributed smaller amounts.
The area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed through two years ago.
According to director Dušek, there could be between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors before the end of the year.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Health Care Act, signed by Barack Obama, is in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection Act and affordable care - which instructs citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, or face a fine, against the Constitution under the government's tax authority.
The court's president, John Roberts, stood on the side of the court's four more liberal members, while Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remainder of the 2700-page bill and further ruled that the statutory requirement for healthcare, which mandates states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise the loss of all funding for social security insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
The action to block that act was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primary, the law was strongly rejected by each of the leading Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed nominee Mitt Romney.
Nadia Konvalinko as a pub.
Is he busy?
Actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar as a pub and was very good at it.
Had the popular Czech actress planned to change her profession and go to her business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinko appeared in James Joyce's Irish pub and made beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
The boss even offered to hire me and I could make a living spinning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stick with what I do to this day, with acting," Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub's operation, revealed with a smile.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey here and there," the actress said.
The event also featured Nadi's long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový.
I am dead and I must not drink in my new life today.
I'm allowed one beer or one shot a day, and I'm trying to keep that up," the actor added.
Egypt puts first freely elected president in office
Muhammad Morsi took the inauguration, but his triumphant day is hard to end with political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Morsi promised "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the first freely elected president of the country, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his commission before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore an oath to 18 judges dressed in black gowns in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are aiming for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony a live broadcast on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-based engineer and Muslim Brotherhood member, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time, the building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers.
Only a few hundred supporters rallied in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and, unlike Mubarak's presidential flamboyance, traffic was only briefly halted to allow the motorcade to take the course of the city's downtown to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, mockingly referred to as the non-charismatic "reserve tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has soared since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also of all those who want to lead to the end of the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state," Morsi, clad in a blue social suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-pandated chamber where he swore an oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to present his inauguration address.
As he stood at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander was the military commander of Field Marshal Hussein Tanthai.
His arrival was accompanied by chants of the "army and the people are the one-handed" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s it became a stronghold of the Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square on Friday, the place where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government last year was born, and solemnly promised to re-grab the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath of office in court, rather than in front of the parliament, as is customary, he acquiesced to the will of the military, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through a man-made center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the bedekr would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves."
They roam the cemeteries slowly, gaining an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs they are, how big and cohesive families they belong, how old they die here, how important they are to their degrees and professions.
How they express their social standing, their taste.
And from the state of graves, they find out how the bereaved heeded of their dead.
Halloween 2013: By numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
For two years, there's no candy in my apartment, and this year is probably no different.
However, the statistics show that I am, in hint of Halloween, the black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year's most Americans will be celebrating Halloween – actually 158 million of them – and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations.
But what I look forward to every time on Halloween is the trends.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion spent is expected to go $1.2 billion to costumes.
This year, the latest fad of fashion is the sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; meals like pizza, hamburger and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect the parade of the dead to see a lot of zombies, and I bet the space men at Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we put our dogs in costumes and, to my astonishment, we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, the Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for animal pets.
So there's gonna be a lot of funny dogs.
As for sweets, we don't waste any time.
According to Nielsen, the Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg of Hershey, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a wonderful piece of news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who are going to raid our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe it or not, consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" "Howl-O-Scream" (The Horror, the Whore) and "The Death of Shock" (The Shock).
In fact, there are officially insiders in the United States of 1,200 haunted homes that, according to the company, American haunted houses make a $500 million profit, and that includes those amazing photos that you're watching the fears and who get posted to Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like, looks at the photo and comments as "you face nicely."
Finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a large pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin lantern is kind of like decorating a Christmas tree - we've done it since we were a little kid.
Fortunately for us, the "child in pumpkin" trend started with the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up to carve carving instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the US Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the shuffling flame on your front porch is probably from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their veneer weighing almost one ton.
How the insectes from Thailand picked up the sales of the Paris bar
You may be scraping over the insects, unaware that you eat it quite voluntarily every year.
For example, grounded in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nourishing and you are also taken care of by the unique experience.
The insect offer was first placed on the menu of his establishment in Paris at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, which was the inspiration for William Burroughs' book The Naked Lour, would be found in the fashionable 18th arrondus near Montmartre by well-visited tourists.
With fresh avocados, roasted red peppers, ginger and quailing egg, guests can now only bite down on various larvae, grasshoppers or water beetles, and scorphenias can be tasted here.
Carefully and specially packed vans (so as to avoid insects harming the wings, don't hurt their legs or damage their eyes) send Daviron all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it's common elsewhere.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is an ecological benefit, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (as far as finance, space and water consumption are concerned) than traditional meat.
"In addition, the insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, simply aiming to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant is a pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be excited by the idea of eating a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reaction of the Paris bar's customers to the restaurants served is, according to the owner, very positive.
Even the skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they begin with the smallest bites, and only finally pick a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting saucers range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing hands to you CHANGE I NEW.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were to resolve an unsolvable role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, which had washed their hands after the setback, gave a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
The group's "with washed-up hands" also did better in the next test than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands got worse results in other tests than those who didn't have them washed.
The results of the "artifold" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failure.
The results of the test show, according to psychologists, that the body's purity removes really negative feelings after the failure.
But motivation is also falling, with the test being much more focused on the next tests.
If we had transferred the research results to the Czechs, perhaps the most optimistic would be when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs are not washing their hands, but along the way through the city transport it is a fifth.
Hygiene is also usually adhered to after work in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 per cent of people wash their hands.
The house pet's houseworking motivates 78.7 per cent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands afterhand to a stranger's hand.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I fear the reality is different and people are trying to do a bit better," commented the survey's skin doctor Klaudie Komárková.
A tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico with its own railway was found
It has been able to discover one of the most sophisticated drugs smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railroad.
U.S. officials described the tunnel, about one by one by one meter, as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds to a length of nearly six football pitches, connects a warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of vague warehouses, where it is easy to hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be brought in undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, who the authorities worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life in prison.
In the town of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating large drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts the problem with the drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres in length equipped with tracks that ran from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Is Europe's elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (commerce for Britain) was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the EU that British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British businessmen about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 business leaders representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The survey results will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government's preference for new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than get bogged down in a long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked for their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels' regulations were now outweighed by the benefits of being part of the European trade area - even 40 per cent of the large companies, the most pro-European companies, had even expressed their consent.
Finally, our business leaders survey revealed the most telling knowledge, that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to amend the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not policy.
The findings with which businesses of different sizes and the main business groups have endorsed show that the business sector is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will take back the influence back on Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a gain of up to 16% in the vote in the referendum to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
This also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current rebalancing of forces towards Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and increasingly necessary, given the eurozone's path as a narrower economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, for business it means a re-oriented trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.

The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project would "touch the UK together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he had been "enthusiastic" by working with the British Government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of the Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted interviews with the national transport office of Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 to find out about additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the northern and Scottish regions.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and fewer hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for the HS2 is really a national network that will better connect the UK and its cities."
We gave the SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is enormous.
Without this, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a link – across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected by the HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added, "The announcement today is good news for Scotland."
Under the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "one unambiguously" support for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The treetop-speed line has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds to Scotland's economic weight in the overall case of the high-speed rail across Britain."
We are therefore enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed rail to Scotland and thus benefiting everyone and adding the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British Ministers, over the next year and the joint decision-making on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 on its flights for storing hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for the hand bag and $2 for a coffee or soda, although they said in their announcement on Wednesday that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new baggage fee applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so the small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers are waiting until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge this fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second luggage provided in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and stuffed them into the hand luggage hidden in the storage compartment as much as they could, so that there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee was not really to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage compartment is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not be valid.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring in the bag for which he will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queued for the same bag pays USD 100.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures would be modified to ensure that passengers learned about the fee before they arrived at the gate.
The new fee for Frontier for hand luggage will not yet be in force before the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
She argues that the handling of baggage costs money, and the passengers who are requesting this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the next baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
But most did not touch the charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost company, Allegiant Air, followed its example later.
The only company that also has such charges is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the pay for menus baggage would bring in USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior executive at Midwest Airlines, had recently flown with Spirit, marveling at what he had seen at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual payment from Spirit for hand-on luggage.
"The uptake of the plane was the most smooth I've ever seen in my flying career," he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and arguments at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in an instant."
Frontier will also apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, along the lines of Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be served for free.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but withdrew from it seven months later after complaints from passengers, and no major airline had emitted it.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand luggage if a passenger does not purchase a flight directly from this airline, its latest effort is to direct customers directly to their website.
Airlines pay online travel dealers such as Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone furthest in this area.
In September, it started giving customers who bought a travel agency via an online travel agency for only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the flown mile to 25 per cent miles from the journey.
So a trip with Frontier, 1,000 miles purchased through an online travel agency, means a reward of 250 miles.
Customers also allow the company to choose its seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly via the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to financial results reported on Wednesday by company partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity shrank by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, Republic is trying to solve Frontier's financial problems.
We studied 11 TISSUES OF THE INZERTEME!
We know where you're wanted to go to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 job-seeking adverts, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 advertisements (62 per cent) on the internet.
The internet is therefore becoming the most important media outlets for publishing job offers.
As recently as 2005, when the survey was first conducted, his share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it has stabilised at around 60 per cent.
The advertisement of the employment options in itself, according to the analysis, reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in a period of economic prosperity and a time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reporting period, up from less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the internet is geared towards a narrower, in particular a more skilled group of professions.
By contrast, the offer of a job in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including the workers' professions, according to the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The representation rate of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, adverts attracted top-level ads looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leading small businesses was only on the internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, while the large representation is mainly due to the service and working-class professions.
The most frequently cited requirements that employers express through an advertising offer are, of course, education.
Other areas surveyed included a knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the demand for knowledge of a foreign language was made in three per cent of advertisements, and on the internet in 37 per cent.
In only two per cent of advertisements, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of the adverts (in the daily press at 11 percent, on the internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the industry was required in 54 percent of the advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally linked to skilled professions.
These are in particular the head of production and other managers.
For the blue-collar professions, they are mainly mechanics and repairers or food product manufacturers or repairers of electrical appliances, added the study's author Jiří Tillner.
Employers also set out requirements for potential candidates in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently sought-after skills, the advertisement skills have already appeared in the first place in the first place.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organisational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres face low attendance
This is according to data from the real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre is opening to the public in Bohnice, Prague, making it the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
The unpleasant feat for about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large centre towards the site and the poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and messy arrangement of passages, or dead places of the centres," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of retail real estate department, Jones Lang LaSalle, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the department's shopping centres face low attendance.
The main reasons include, among other things. poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market oversaval in the given location.
Some of the projects opened up almost fully-filled, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are a bit conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres must try harder to 'tack' their customers to the new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Soták, rising at some centres, because landlords were willing to discount their rent in the crisis and to default some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully booked and the average occupancy rate is reduced (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Shopping centres opened in the past two years are being promoted in the market very slowly, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a market place for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
In Prague, for example, we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', aimed at buying and daily use services for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
Soták also says there is a place for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
This is for both small 'service' centres and for major projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or an extension in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague he sees a space for the upcoming shopping centre on Victory Square, according to him, the streets Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square have a clear potential.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, which allows traders to be covered and expanded to be covered and expanded to other smaller cities at favourable rents and operating costs, the space is still in some locations for smaller local or housing shopping centres, respectively their reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefits from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of gross lettable space.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
The Czech Republic is below the EU average in the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is lagging behind by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants compared to the values from Britain and France.
Parents of teenage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of the teenage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a coiled wrestling spirit in his high school gym's gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the town of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th, locked in a straightened spirit behind the bleachers in the gymnasium where he went.
Sheriff's investigators at the Lowndes County district concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
"They are unequivocally convinced that their son was murdered," attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he'd died the way the sheriff said he'd died.
"They believe it defies logic, the laws of physics, and also the common sense," Crump said.
They believe it should cover up for what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he came back in their corpse bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions had gone unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll be watching the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told the newspaper that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of "send-up choking."
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, gave a different cause of death.
"There are a few question marks that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in the Johnson case to investigate a criminal investigation or violation of civil rights, he would ask the FBI and its execution.
A deputy to the Sheriff's Office from the Lowndes district was not immediately available for a possible comment on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance video that investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents hope the video footage will include a trail leading to the revelation of their son's death.
Report: Obama campaign considered swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest adviser secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the incoming book and announced Thursday night that the president's top avengers had held intensive group meetings and surveys in late 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to the Times's National-Political correspondent for the Magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of senior executives' efforts within the campaign, and in the White House, namely Bill Daley's former White House chief of staff, to measure the effect on the election of moving former Secretary of State Clinton to the vice presidency.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisors David Axeld and David Plouffe – were aware that this change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they eventually decided not to make the move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would not "turn up the chance of Obama significantly."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been researching a whole lot of things in intensity, and this was one of them," he told the Daley.
You mustn't forget that the president had a terrible prospect at the time, so we were like, "Cride, what are we to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "unofficial care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made substantial investments to see if the move would pay off in the election.
"Fraudits don't include that kind of money for elections and qualitative research unless something is really being considered," Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential bouncing of the cards.
While Daley said he did not think the president was "aware of the potential changes," the former office manager admitted that it was "possible" to Obama.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not finally answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he had seriously thought that Obama had not been aware of research regarding the removal of Biden from the ticket.
"Maybe," Martin said.
No, Mr. Hasek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that not this way.
Pressure is needed to relieve Martin Hašek of all political positions and leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already scant.
Martin Hašek is shielded by the promise he made, but everyone and politician in particular need to be aware of the consequences of the promise and give great consideration to what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the tangible one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The self-improvement program promoted by the liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he steers in politics.
Mr. Hasek, if that's the case with this country (and your frequent statements make me sure, if you weren't lying right now - here you see how difficult it is with the lie), you leave politics yourself, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as a statement to the man who made the mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words or actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be a proud, if erring, man-made person or a lifetime of the sket.
It may seem to you that it is unjust to address only you, but you are the leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you are the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to lower your ears for a while, regroup the forces, sit out the embarrassment, and then attack again, but that's the way the guerrillas or the backstabbers behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes, a leader, the alpha male, so be so you behave.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that can easily fit into your car's dashboard.
The devices that follow every kilometre the motorist drives, and that transmit this information to the authorities, is at the heart of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate the outdated US major road funding system.
The usually teddy design of the highways suddenly prompted an intense debate and the emergence of a variety of leagues.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small box boxes to record the miles travelled and perhaps even where you were going – and then using this information to build a tax placement.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy problems.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They are looking to see how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road he's on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of which we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking mileage at every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The impetus is the fact that the Road Trust Fund, financed by taxes, that Americans pay at the service stations, is at rock bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
With the current high price of petrol, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of payment for the kilometre travelled.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user charge by the mileage.
It is no surprise that the idea is enjoyed by urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behavioural patterns, which, for example, can help to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas creation.
California designers look up to this system in the planning of strategies to meet the targets set out in the ambitious Global Heathing Laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (deput to Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also saw it as the most useful long-term alternative.
Free market officials at the Reason Foundation are also in favor of the idea that drivers will pay for the mileage.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, the vice president of strategy at the Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers who encouraged Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of paying per kilometre.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives' leadership rejected the proposal and did so because of concerns from rural legislators representing the members of the population, whose daily life often means to travel many kilometres to work outside the city.
But several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The scoreliest is Oregon, which has included 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state the tax on the mileage, instead of the tax on petrol.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is researching the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, along with coastal states in the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
But this concept has no supporters alone.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"Fearing the Big Brother surveillance and similar issues were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and traffic management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union warned in Nevada on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build a huge cumbershcapable technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to the record of daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that is trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometres the car will take, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hunt for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance travelled).
This firm was initially not involved in the event to help the government's taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market for legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they would drive away.
But this device that tests attracts the attention of the road network's designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded by the modem.
"People will be more willing to go for it unless you're following their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these pilot programmes have produced a number of major errors.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, the designers experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage travelled by all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In the city of New York, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay fees for parking hours, to provide insurance on miles travelled, and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid the traffic jam.
"The motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits they are offered," the city's design document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge proxy problem.
Officials at the Metropolitan Crust Transportation Committee in San Francisco say Congress could very easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the petrol tax increase.
A one-off or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There's no need for a radical operation if you can take the aspirin," Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee, said.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both firms confirmed the negotiations, and according to a variety of sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, the hand is said to be in the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction is expected to come in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequencies auction, before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor, Karel Komárek, owns the KKCG Group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it embarked on an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, the company's appetite for leaking into telecommunications was not mentioned.
But Sazka is now run by a very experienced telecommunications maverick Robert Chvátal.
He started out as the marketing chief of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), then became director of T-Mobile, Slovakia, and last headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She's applied for auction, and now she's admitted to launching a virtual underballer at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator into its network.
Vodafone would probably not like that under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářské noviny's information, it may be part of the two companies' much closer cooperation.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that may be Sazka.
If the latter succeeds in a tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer, it can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning off only the limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will release Sazka to its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to make the network a fast start.
Sazka will start building a costly LTE network in between, which will also be available to Vodafone.
Satisfied, both companies can be satisfied.
The money saved could then be spent by Vodafone on a fixed internet or cable provider.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of a Czech) he would immediately acquire a fully-fledged operator with still good profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mogul that's going to be in store for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have won the LTE networks for O2 and, very likely, in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both firms have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could thus finally end in success, but rather probably not with the high amounts enjoyed by the state budget.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between a call with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September over a protest against planned oil exploration in the Arctic have been shipped from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
AFP reported the news today, citing the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original accusation of its piracy activists has not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women, detained in Russia after a nonviolent action against an oil rig in the Arctic, were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to DPA, it was a planned move.
Authorities first charged environmentalists with piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced that the charge would be replaced by a more lenient riot service, for which there is a lower sentence with a lower term of seven years imprisonment.
But Greenpeace pointed out in a statement today that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped by the authorities, as they have promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Committee of Investigation announced last week that it would replace the charges of piracy with disorderly conduct charges.
But when the 30th of the prisoners faced the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new accusation was filed against everyone," AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement, from 18 countries, at the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has dismissed them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of the imprisonment.
According to AFP, Greenpeace's CEO Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate the meeting of detainees with their families and consular workers.
But there are no guarantees that conditions in a new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he cautioned.
The help was requested by the Dutch king Willem-Alexile of the Netherlands by one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, it called on the monarch to discuss their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster against a police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass the information on to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared his drug addiction would come out.
A Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who briefed a drug mobster of a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to be the suspect in cocaine use to the head of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough, to relay sensitive information about the investigation into his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by the criminals as the best attorney, was arrested at home after police surveillance by Scarborough, who was represented in previous narcotics proceedings, in 2011 at home.
Officers saw Sarborough (32) leave three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, who had just been having dinner with his fellow Law Society.
Based on tests to find traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular-sector of a Class A-Class drug user.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to get information on the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being tracked at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police intercepted heroin and cocaine worth about £1.5 million in cash during a series of raids, police arrested heroin and cocaine, with a further 32 people ended up in prison.
Ditta (42) passed information to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, had a shameful time before the Lovi Lovi Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of defending the administration of justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after a police investigation into Scarborough found that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's home, and spotted him placing the drugs on the cleanliness of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket of black golf gloves.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
The court heard that traces of the A-grade drug were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards on his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, and said he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client and argued that their conversation fell under "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all detained and her hair samples taken.
During the police interview, he said that he ran an office at both his home address and the workplace, and that the clients had visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Whoever else is more aware that they must not infringe the law but the criminal advocate."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as an attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were doubtless legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession; on the contrary, he disgraced it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta dismissed the offence and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not, and I would like to pass the information on to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately."
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said, "Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself from the criminal counsel in the criminal field as he started getting drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups, who tasked him with gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal advocates must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and are to inspire confidence and the public feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire has conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstructing the administration of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the criminal to justice.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law's hands.
We'll find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of collusion for the supply of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, saying that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Mohammed Ali to be and cited inequality as a motivation for the job.
Obama backs off health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama backed away from hist-turned and ambitious promise yesterday that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
Citing hundreds of thousands of reports of testimony from providers, Republicans have accused the president of misleading the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama flinched from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called the "dismenwitch in the media" about the testimonies, Obama called on the Americans who received these notifications to seek out new safeguards in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not come as a surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchased the insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans to be honest: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her testimony to the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market had been "inwallowing" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
The irritated Sebelius addressed the phrase on by the microphone on, addressed the counseling officer behind her yesterday at the Committee's meeting yesterday, which took place after a fierce exchange with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, about whether she, too, had to join the Obama program of care herself.
For more than three hours during the hearing for Sebelius, he repeatedly lashed out at the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up on the government-sponsored insurance, and had not enrolled the program through HealthCare.gov, which was now imposing on millions of Americans.
He travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 female Topicals of the Year's for the 2013 CNN Heroes Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes Award, you can vote for him or for any other of the ten main candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Cameroon's capital, Yaounde.
At first he was treated only with a broken arm, but subsequently developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that had caused him problems all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people only die because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per population.
And even if the doctors could be visited by the Cameroonis, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's healthcare expenditure in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
With the poor point, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a vascular surgeon physician at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped his group of volunteers with nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are packed in vans, attaching to the rooftops of medical supplies, and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: a feast, a singing and a dance, and the best accommodations the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and unbridled energy, is very willing to engage in the local merriment.
The next day, the team begins nursing hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a maiden certificate for free – a documentary requested by the school, but which many miserable families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team does simple surgeries under local anaesthetic.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, in the town hall or at home; after the surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make way for the next patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room, and the Bwelle sanitation and its volunteers work for the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay awake and keep working, they play the drums all night long," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year, realising that their help could mean a lot to the locals.
One man said he would be able to work again after his hernia surgery.
"That will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for the private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that it is this second job that funds about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers for Bwell's group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do those campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We were washing our hands thoroughly for Dr. Bwelle and removing the blood stains or holding his instruments," says O'Malley.
As a second-year medical student in America, you'll never experience that.
Students of volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But as soon as they reach Yaounde, food, transport, and their studies, Bwelle provides them with.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant struggle is not a burden.
To help others live happily, to fulfill the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
To laugh at people, to alleviate their pain - that's why I do it.

Central banks to keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England, and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland, and Japan will become a permanent tool to give banks access to global currencies whenever they need.
The Banks said as much in their joint statement.
"This is a very sensible move," commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays, a London bank.
"So far, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so I don't think that's any surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market falters for the first time.
The central bank agreements gave access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision by the central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its program to support the US economy, which could drive the price of money even higher in the global market.
By default, the swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency, with the current liquidity surplus of the other.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of currency to another.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to bring back confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed to a banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
Number of HIV infections exceeds 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people grows every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed an infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121 and by 2010 there were 180.
Last year, there were 212 infections and a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I think there is no doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for Summer for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients were added in the country last year from January to September, this year there were 176 during the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 infected residents.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian or 116 from Ústecký.
The fewest in the Highlands come from the Highlands, 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with a blood transfusion in the past.
However, such a case has not occurred since the beginning of testing, i.e. more than a quarter of a century, in the Czech Republic.
Six children were also born with HIV, and he transferred to them from his mother.
Children should be taught to myths and legends as "models for a way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that "the gruesome force cannot be equal to clever cunning," while the arthranes' legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of myths would be "more wild, too scandalous for teaching at the school," said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of the appropriate age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creations are already part of education," he said.
I have defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that the "openly instructive" authors and teachers are a "suit" message for children in an engaging story with a "switch."
Crossley-Holland, translated from Anglo-Saxon by the epos Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Festags, says: "You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children takes some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or endored by a happyend, but there must be a natural sense of purpose and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly established.
An old truth about showing off than to describe it.
Miloslava Cejpková: November's smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not used to.
First she put down her smile, the one she kept on display as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
This made her very relieved, because it was a mask she chose not to be put off in public.
He was only sincere at home on the days when she grandmothered and had grandchildren Elinka or Aadya around her.
And, of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered very well the lesson from the endless course of business skills.
Now they were finally in perfect use.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a masquerade disguise.
November, or any other moon, can't do the miracle to be a real smile, like they did when they were on a public service trip with the one that hasn't been around for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier's style evolve like a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time guide our brand to modern things to avoid remaining a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, in an interview interview with HN.

GM is pulling down some new light trucks in the US to repair seat backrests
According to Friday's announcement from the US Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is withdrawing nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, to repair a fault with a manual tilting backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the front seat tilting mechanism may be a fault.
As a result, the seat backs are not in line with the federal standards of automotive safety for headrests.
A notice posted on the StateSurric Safety Traffic Safety website on the road (NHTSA) says that "if the car gets hit from behind, the headrest of the headboard may not be properly protected by the passenger, which increases the risk of injury."
The downloaded models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
GM launched a shipment to the market in June and is the most important launch for this leading US automaker since restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the announcement to the owners over the government's 16-day dysfunction, which weakened the growth in car sales in October.
Sales of deliveries of the Silverado and Sierra deliveries, which were revised for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Too inquisitive newspaper to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator told the press.
New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public petition to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The Warden said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction."
The "right-plan" order came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng group Evening News issued several false reports on the said company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disordered," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide to "put Chen Yongzhou an administrative penalty in the form of the revival of the journalism's license."
He also "arranged the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out a comprehensive correction to the New Express and recommend that they examine the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express paper."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express concerning financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming that he was behind his journalism's work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to making false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told the state-run news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was fazing for money and fame.
I realize I acted wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued an excment address on the front page, stating that it had failed to perform enough scrutiny of his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects have been filmed in television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of a change to the law this year, which prohibits the authorities from forcing the authorities to charge anyone to accuse themselves.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are taking up
At a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought the house and I gave all my money," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 (SGD) every month as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is that ValueMax, where the woman is making her transaction, became the third pawnshop on the list this week.
Stopping jewelry is not just a quicker way to borrow cash - the 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The Singapore pawnshops routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, the paittals have the advantage of not requiring the verification of the person (decline) or proof of income, and they can provide a loan faster than banks.
And so, as families feel pressure about rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly because of the increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with increasing costs, people from the high to the low [re-size" scale will try to replenish their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia's CIMB.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people hastily stopping their personal possessions and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family's jewellery for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in the city's 200 stalwarts are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest pawn shutter operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
The growth in the pawnn sector is so great that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Executive Director Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors have come under fire from criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the pledge offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers stop the items they already own and the monetisation of personal property does not increase the household debt," he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly being accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure funding.
Besides, those who use the pawnshop are not just people in financial distress.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use the TrustMax branches by stopping the Rolex's gold rods or watches, allowing them to reach 60 percent of the purchase price of cash.
Our customers are from all sorts of backgrounds.
"They are the wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their bold business or investments, or small businesses that need help to resolve the problems in their cash flow," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as they can.
The NSA website's downfall is not blamed by hackers, but by an "internal flaw"
The mysterious National Security Agency reported last Friday that its website crashed for several hours last week due to an internal error, not an attack by hackers, as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov posts were not open for several hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be eliminated during the evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by the DDoS (distributed service rejection) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA website had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the internal sensitive networks of the agency had not been "at risk" at all.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacking activists claimed online that it was responsible for scrapping the NSA's sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overtaken and the site falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple, and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, which once dubbed No Like an Agency, has become the focus of public attention following a string of revelations in foreign and domestic surveillance programs in recent months, and the target of a biting critique of the product of the theft of NSA secret files from the agency and their disclosure by the disillusionmented former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Number of HIV infected in Prague exceeds 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the surveillance in 1986 to the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolitan area.
This is according to statistics from the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the National Institute of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infections throughout the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 immune failure, the disease has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been growing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 it revealed 180.
The number dropped to 153 the year before last, but it was a record-breaking year last year.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, I don't think there's any doubt," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who ran the Prague House of Light for Patients for Professionals for years.
From October to the end of the year 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and 47 last year, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed by 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has broken out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this country: Presidents on the brink of power
It is almost the norm that, at the country's key moments, the head of state was not in such a form to meet his statesmanship.
If he were T. Masaryk, physically and mentally, five years younger, would live to see the end of his presidential term, and the events surrounding Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after a symbolic resistance, the air force could fly across the border, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not struggle to fight for its legitimacy there.
And most of all, the nation would not have a hangover from that surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in condition for Munich, but it started to go downhill with him during the war and in February 48 he acted accordingly.
To be a little better, he could go into exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hácha.
They elected him, saying that "the president will not be in a situation for him to make decisions."
But he had to, though it probably wasn't a big decision to make a big decision with a knife on the neck at Hitler's chancellery.
The head of intelligence, František Moravec, until the last few days in March 1939 said what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew about on the day, did not go so smoothly and with such a profit for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, both did not believe him, and were afraid.
The human wreck Gottwald had his age-old fellows executed, as Moscow had instructed.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely barred by the share of normalisation and they had to unseat him, already completely senile, de-escal.
That Husák was helpless and the sick depressing old man made things easier in November 89, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky to have not been met in office in the last few years, spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look like he looks and we don't know all about that yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the Republic of external threat now.
Or maybe it's threatening, just not to see it.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not (in historical terms) as well that the president is not entirely at strength.
But it is not a normal state.
Couldn't we elect someone acceptably thinking and conventionally sound as president in this country again?

Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
TOP 09 President Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one in an interview, he told Aktuálně.cz that there is no other way out of the vote, and every government resulting from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible patchwork.
"It can't last long," Karel Schwarzenberg said, estimating the lifestyle of the start of the term of the start of the term within two years.
He disagrees with the objection that voters will hardly choose in a very different way next time: "I think it will be a slightly more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the TOP 09 president does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (it lost about 300,000 votes compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there would be an early election, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will be losing ground.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where chairman Bohuslav Sobotka said after a secret meeting of the party's leadership in the party leadership that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democrats, Schwarzenberg comments in his own:
"The leading functionaries of the democratic party as little boys go to the head of state to allow them to march in the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was more skilful and intelligent."
"Because I have never seen anything so eagerly executed in my life," added the chairman of TOP 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the battle for the presidency), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take the party's seizure."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House of Commons, including the Farsky Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the TOP 09 chairman argues that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed."
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the ANO election leader, Martin Komárek, accused TOP 09 in a pre-election fight that the idea of introducing a treaty register "craising" the ANO program.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off a proposal that was on its way to a second House reading.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check out the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of "trausing to the phone, watching and confrontation" to confirm a fraudulent tip for a love affair that was to involve then-Intercommaster Charles Clarke.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World newspaper had picked up fake reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and break into her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had called her, too, and was leaving her with voice messages.
"The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor, is not the man in front of the house, hoping to catch people out there, but a man who likes to give people stories to see what they say," said Mr Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore the stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, he must know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "Oh, of course he knows."
Rumors about the love affair that Clarke is involved were first captured by the NotW News Agency when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions, was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on the private investigator's computer, where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as the "Projects."
During the time Ms. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls in asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup were overseeing the monitoring of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Coulson eats 18. In June 2005, he left a voice message in which he told her, "I got a story we're about to publish tomorrow that Charles and I would love to talk about."
Mr Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing the co-defendant Rebeka Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied getting in the business with other people to hack into the phones in the period from 3. October 2000 until 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of New York's Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the venue for a solo comic performance to be born in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the people of the chatter's chatter's point of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Festival of Comedy.
The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the documentary comedy Carolines, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the point where they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (starred as heroes), an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has spread, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has risen up with his sitcom (the cheerle-spitting "League" on the FXX's fantastic-football theme) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation" programs, but she was most famous for her fast-spreading series of "Marcel the shell with shoes on" (Marcel's Battles in Shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognisable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the vitriol-focused, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), is the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg will speak to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting is held at Town Hall in Midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he walks down the aisle between two buildings from time to time, and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the columnist Pečinka spoke in such a way that one could agree, whereas Chairman Štěch was stirring up a discord.
The commissioner Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau and confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and it is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed off their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaoralek made it the most impossible to give a television interview.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to nominate the Vice-President of the Senate, Gajdůšková, the only one who would not have had an initial henchikep, and I think she would perform at the standard.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support him.
I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and proceed without rupturing the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the Peoples, but with the People's Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This mini-state government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and such a commitment was to be supported by President Úsvitu Okamura.
Chairman Babiš would eventually accept the progression of taxes, as he is keen and will see that it is not possible without it.
The Peoples would not bring problems because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in the government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, there would be a valuable minister, but when they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but they will provide support, also well.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Bárta's detention is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leakage of wiretaps?
The chairman of Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, the head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics of the Anti-Corruption Police, Jan Petržílek, was detained.
The detention is linked to wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The news of the wiretaps, which was approached by news server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a trusted source to the Czech Press Office.
The intercepted phone calls by Janoušek and Bém published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibříku," show Janoušek's influence in the steps of the city under Bém's direction.
The Journal reported at the time that they were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which they leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was owned by Barta.
News.cz reported that the detained criminologist Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently involved in the wiretaps, at the same time they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case is not to be commented on by the inspection for the same reason.
He and Vít Bárta also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's defense attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption by VV MPs, did not want to comment too much on the case either, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but given the protection of classified information I cannot comment further."
According to Právo, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
Tn.cz reported that Bárta could have been able to buy classified information from the police.
According to the server První izpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment Barta was allegedly sought to be.
But the Law's latest information shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Police Presidium spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this inquiry with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Právo on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who is overseeing Bart's case, and therefore, her words implicitly imply that the file or the criminal proceedings are conducted under secrecy.
The reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta, Kateřina Klasnová, in front of their residence in Prague's Klárov district.
She was loading the suitcases in the car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bart's detention.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our ticket, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the House of Representatives in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case bribing members of Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months, suspended for 30 months.
The sentence was subsequently changed and Barta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mozambique's security escalate over the conflict of strong figures
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of the Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to cheer peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the managing director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded her company garb for a T-shirt decorated with the words "we're requesting safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were reports of almost daily conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, one of the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict would erode the country again, but recent events have startled foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake, as the discoveries of large-scale coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest may bring more than $50 billion worth of investment over the next few years from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and American Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have accused each other of the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party alleges that the government has sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party on September 17.
The violent attack of the former rebels subsequently culminated in the government forces attacking the Renamo party base and attempting to kill Afonsa Dhlakama, the group's leader, the party's spokesman, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of triggering conflicts because it is said to have attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to alleviate the fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French press office AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama had seen himself as a "loss" who wanted to use "whatever his strength remained to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim to avoid the war.
But concerns grew when Mr. Mazanga's words were quoted as Reneamo withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but to be serious," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease the tensions between these parties, fuelled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and the Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought electoral changes, has already said it would boycott the local elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial proceeds from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Mozambique (DHM) movement, which was founded by a former Renamo party, will improve its position in the election as expected.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – who is out of his second term next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"It doesn't want a democratic system of multiple parties, it doesn't want transparent elections, it doesn't want to make peace because it doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south road.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from the capital Maputo, but where is the city of Beira, a port on which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on in their export of coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when the Renamo side threatened to attack the route.
Mr Mazanga would not comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community for the situation in Mozambique that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened the government's frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, a slow pace of development and a recent flood of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president, and that he is to be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"None cares about Renama or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Tripodi denies Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be under investigation by the State's Corruption Supervisory Committee.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he was changing the policy of the coastal leasing at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its search to see if Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to be a lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, resumed without having to take part in a tender after his expiration in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's clandestine interests in these properties, based on evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
Over the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to tender.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of the ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of the tenders.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rental policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC in August to September 2007 showed the calls between Mr Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Steve Dunne, the lead official who had come to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Unit.
"Was he the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial leasing policy?" aide, aid commissioner, Anthony Wheala, asked Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
Dog summed up carpet, president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol Hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and left for the castle in Lány.
What kind of health is he in?
Cabbage bubbles in Kunovice, they don't add chemistry to it
They want to produce more than 1,000 tonnes of sauerkraut cabbage in the coming months in Slovácké Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last for about six months.
He has produced a healthy delicacy here since 1925 in the traditional way, i.e. pedalling right in the big tanks.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our female workers will tread a shift for a nearly ten-kilometre route.
Each of the ten tanks can accommodate fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the race director of Slovácká Fruta, David Kladroba.
The cabbage muffins are brought to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsk and Břeclav.
Fruta's employees then clean the vegetables, remove the broomsticks and throw them in the ring.
From there, the already sliced cabbage falls into swimming pools of six metres deep, at which pedals are tirelessly working clad in white clothing and boots.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last trodden layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The visible hump is then aged for six to eight weeks for spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of fermentation substances," the director of Kladroba pointed out.
The natural process corresponds to the production in home conditions, with the workers sizing through salt and cumin.
The cabbage after the fermentation travels to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet and sour brine in sachets or jars and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut to the domestic and Slovak markets.
He is also interested in it in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Damkova is said to be forbidden by UEFA to publish penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees' committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing the penalties for the judges.
She is forbidden by UEFA rules, as she said in an interview with the daily newspaper Právo.
Otherwise, he said, FAČR would face penalties.
Damkova also denied siding with the Pilsen footballers where she came from in her role.
This speculation is really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of the vote I can lose 1:6," Damkova said in response to the criticism that stormed after Plzeň has recently played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
Thus, although the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees in recent months, Damkova assures that the referees are paying the price for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the board finds out that the referee made a mistake, they will restrict his delegation, whatever the match," Damk said.
The reason for not disclosing the punishments, according to Damka, is a ban on the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and punishes the breach harshly."
"We're very suspicious of us, and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop doing this, there will be harsh sanctions," Damk said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the disclosure continued, he said, the commission could lose UEFA's money to educate and develop referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not fulfill the program to educate the referees," Damkova added.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit forecast and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base pre-tax profit to be between $325 and 340 million, compared to USD 305 to 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said the Flight Centre generated an 8% first-half profit and began with a sharp rise in Australian and British non-working travel.
"On date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for a record annual profit before interest and tax," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our greatest creators of profit.
Entrepreneurship with recreational activities has risen during the second half of Australia, compensating for the slightly weaker domestic market for business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while corporate clients spent less.
US trade has recovered after a loss during the season-lower semester and is expected to make a full-year profit for the third time in a row.
The Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had delivered the 40-year-old Australian to an "issue of extradition," saying he was asking him to attend the police station and that if he did not, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange, under a British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
Fearing to have him to go to the US, he sought it out for December 19. June's refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard "committed an extradition notice to a 40-year-old man he is asking to appear at the police station on the day and hour that were addressed to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he has released 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court ruled: Nečas can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for any crimes he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by the procedural immunity that applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marko Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, he decided that they could not be punished for possible offences until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
The court's decision rejected the motion of the public prosecutor, Iva Izzard, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
They, he said, had accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in passing the laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be further prosecuted.
Aircraft manufacturers argue over the width of the seats, big orders are at stake
There was a dispute between the aircraft's lead manufacturers over the width of seats in the second-class seats for long-distance flights, which this month gave the cause of a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai flight show.
The subject of dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would usually be preceded by, but whose assigned space is the key to the demands for efficiency in the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards to offer at least 46 cm wide economy class seats, but Boeing's main American rival says airlines are to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell the largest version of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear of the aircraft is distributed - especially whether it is sidewarming 9 or 10 seats - is the basis for economic performance claims for proposals for new minic-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out by 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing to the public about the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively showed what the start of a new advertising war may be when he showed financiers a picture depicting three people crammed at a restaurant with the headline "Would you like to have it?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul long-haul flights in seats than those in regional turboprop aircraft," Airbus sales manager John Leahy said.
As the eating is changing, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air travel, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent by the turn of the century, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American has a waist of 100 cm in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that its rival sticks to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research that suggests that the 2.5 cm increase of the seat will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing's seat dimensions are rejected by Airbus, saying it is under the authority of the aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export the charges and equipment.
The company also says that the research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving the airlines flexibility and enabling them to do things they believe they have to make to be successful," said Cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
There is a crucial amount of room for elbows for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute, the plant in aircraft orders with an estimated deal in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalogue prices is enough to deflect the scales of US and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 per cent better efficiency on their latest designs for the twin-engined long-range aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance demands depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and a 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit at unit cost is weakened compared to the 10-seat-left concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to fry more seats and make its planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus's European comfort.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seat cabins in the line for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for the denser distribution that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"A 40-five-centimetre-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view of Airbus, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to make a choice.
The travelled aircraft dealers even carry a measuring band to check the competing layout.
While I boast a good time, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense layout for low-cost and regional travellers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin treatment by offering wider seats in the aisles on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard, but may discourage the wave of sales of the 777X.
CME targets the TV business.
They release almost a quarter of the people.
Media group CME will lay off.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down by a thousand people.
He intends to sew up all the ailing activities and only wants to focus on his core business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
As a result, almost a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of the company CET 21, which holds the broadcasting of TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs some 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV number one TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really cannot comment," said Nova's director of communications, Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES, significant layoffs of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should be on the staffing levels of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined long-time director Adrian Sarbu, talked to analysts during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about wanting to curb all activities unrelated to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing one's own programmes, filmmaking and production activities in particular.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it recharged at auctioning in the bankruptcy of Nortel.
The Rockstar seftist, which bought $4.5 billion of Nortel's patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. circuit court in Texas for violating the patent.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps combine online-sought terms with the relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, which is the crux of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that operate on the Google Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of USD 900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for the patents of Nortel, Google was acquired by Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patents.
"Despite the failure of the attempt to auction the patents at issue, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," the lawsuit reads.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation for damages from Google because, in its view, Google's patent is being infringed intentionally, as the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that a condition for the independence of an independent Scotland in the EU would be his accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected, this was not reflected in the headlines.
No one also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws to their official laws, if it suits them.
As Scotland is not in Schengen now, the offer of an ongoing mismatch would be a cheap retreat for Brussels for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old, he became a dig. The journalist's duck that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet this bearded tale hides one interesting thought.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The euro crisis is the result of the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Across Europe, the party dedicated to the EU has gained influence from the opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came as if from nowhere and already captured nearly five million votes in the federal election in September, effectively "swept out" the Free Democrats (the British Liberal Democrats' appetite).
There has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The economics dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the straitjacket, mounted on the national economies through clinging to the common currency, have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates advantageous for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public spending – which is prompted by Germany.
The current problems with the budget and the currency are due to the deeper cause of Europe's languor in the demeanour performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German firms at consumer expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol as is the case in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the cost of the cost, as we have seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even all the pay freezes in the world would not avert the embattling of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering rebellion, especially in France, once-enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that Germany would rein in and allow Paris to stand up to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a card of political legitimacy, and has pushed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and has pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The queue is now, with 24% of the votes, the most popular party in France – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the fission of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European anti-currency block across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in the history.
It occurs to me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but will be transformed into something more looser in the sense of the 'Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations," favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and cling to the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic chill.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area of (basically) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – it also includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Working with other like-minded countries would be easier in the unrealised Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement that does not promote austerity measures in Europe, which was won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to an opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose the 'non-certain sex'
Germany became the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an ambiguous genital system.
Newborn children will no longer be assigned to either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to bring out any sexes for such children, and allows them to list their birth certificates with their gender as "uncertain" or "unspecified."
The law aims to stop pushing parents to make a hasty decision for a sex-intensive operation for their child and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain a psalque-splitting physician, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year, out of 2,000 children, one that is neither a boy nor a girl is born.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, the umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gorges (vajepeciors or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
The intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender Determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to identify the sexes, it is better to use the best available information to determine it instead of waiting and to monitor the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but it's not the case with most children," he said.
Gender identification can be performed without surgery and can then be waited to see how the identity develops.
The knowledge of the child's sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery of why some people are gay.
The report transmitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transgender people, because their status is not tied to the sex, but to their biological structure, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically composed of both and it cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features can manifest in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair cover, bustle and character, in the primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and the sex tract, or in the structure of the chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the work field, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys not responding to any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to identify male, female or "third genders" in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person in June, winning a court appeal to retain the status of "non-nome" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have a third designation, X, in addition to M (male) and F (female), for intersex people.
In neighbouring France, according to the France 24 news report, the gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this fiercely Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "sex theory" from the school textbooks.
American Catholic online websites also defined themselves against the German law and wrote, "As the world is dragged to a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization into it."
One mother of the newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the children have a sex assigned to the children at birth.
"Paradorship itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she told the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female gender were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek, who had a double sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was something like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn again.
But now, many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, saying that sexual affiliation is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong choice, because they don't know how, given their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you weren't calling for a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with the ambiguous gender was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was pertinent.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment - how the parents raised their child - had acted on child genes and hormones, forming a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a case in 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged by the circumcision, to have their child completely neutered, removed his testicles and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he got surgery back on the boys and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "use the model" to this day.
But in the '90s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations discovered "unhappy with the result."
It was also the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex tract.
Doctors weren't sure whether it had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfied life."
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer organs and testicles were surgically removed and brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to a scout for a scout.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized after I was born and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to make the proper development of his sex tract.
After learning the truth, he changed back to men, took the testosterone dose and had his bust removed,
The surgeries caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law group Advocates through the choice (supermonents of the informed choice) based in California, fears that the German law "calls for branding and stigmata."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will make it to encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose 'non-inderminant' for the child," she said.
We're afraid it's going to encourage the intervention.
We believe it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will come down in the end, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be classified in the third sex."
"The adult should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex," she said.
German law is about to be assigned to it at birth.
This is a battle a little child should not seduce at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest-alanderer from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "give the powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called androgeny insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are faulty, Katie's female features have developed.
He's got a vagina, but he's got no uterus and ovaries.
Katie is now married to 29-year-old and is a children's psychiatric intern at the University of Pennsylvania as an intern.
Although it is barren, he hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush into making their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time before they write "man" or "woman."
In this respect, all is well - you raise your child and love it.
You have an amazing child and you rejoice in it.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the opportunity to involve the child in the decision-making decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds the parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides which sex is more identified with – and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was flown by air from the North Sea drilling platform and released back into the countryside
The bird was brought to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One of the corrosmen was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated earlier by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue centre until he recovered.
The operations centres of Colin Seddon said: "This cobbler was probably migrating from northern Europe when he was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea."
He had apparently run out of power and had found refuge on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added, "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for help."
By the time the cobbler was released, he was in good shape and well.
Znojmo begins with stadium reconstruction
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders to carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the Municipal Stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, the testament to the volcanic activity in Low Jeseník is recent (from a geological point of view).
The last eruptions were still at the start of the Quaternary.
Viewed from a greater distance, at the top of Uhlířský vrch, the striking whitewashed plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of the Auxiliary, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The innkeeper standing next to the church did not be preserved.
Shortly after the church was completed, an avenue was planted from four rows of lime trees, about 1 km long.
The cross road on Uhlířský vrch is the third version, the original one was standing here after 1916, the second, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At the fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used various tree species from the area of NízkiHood.
Similarly, pedestals from the rock from the area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop also lists the name of the sponsor.
Uhlířský vrch is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements of the age are somewhat different, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (old age of 3.3 million) and older than Venusia volcano (old 0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born in an explosion.
In it, she gutted a significant amount of volcanic ash, along with fragments of rock from the bedrock, which were burned by the reddish-brown colour.
At the end of this phase, lava leaked to the surface - today it is a layer of a porosse basalt up to 13 metres powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brownish-red and in places black tuffs.
Their layer is mighty up to 50 metres and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffs, the striking volcanic bombs are up to 1 metre in size. The second eruption was also topped with the outburst through the lava.
At the end of the activity, the volcano's work was leaked by the lava, which now forms up to a 50mm of a powerful layer of slag-like basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate disgorgeing of volcanic ash with lava outlets are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually made up of layers, they were given the name of the stratovkanes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually being erosioned.
However, it was only threatened by the mining of rock in the quarry on the southern side.
The most intensive extraction took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuff were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was halted under pressure from experts and the public to maintain this unique place.
The problem, however, is in the porosity and little cohesion of rock that quickly swells, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The remedy is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhlířský vrch after the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobilists can use unpaid parking lots at the start of the lime alley, where the short nature trail begins.
A drunk doused the house with gasoline: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
Tensions were rising, fear escalating.
The man threatened to set the house on fire.
As a result, all available police patrols in the area went to the scene, as did a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigade.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
The home had to be entered by a SWAT team, which neutralized the man and handcuffed him.
The aggressor then ended up being examined at the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was taken to an alcohol detention centre.
Firefighters eventually covered the house with gasoline with a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to people, all the pets were rescued from the house.
The man did not listen to the police negotiator, so the commando came after him.
Anger at the verdict handed down over the curriculum of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing responded angrily to the verdict passed by the last of the outlaws facing justice and said that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for compiling explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be paroled.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of a mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other counts of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could have insisted that the man with the alias "Demolition man" (the bunny) be given the death penalty thanks to his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision rekindled the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other outleters nearly a decade earlier.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should be following in the footsteps of the others.
To AAP, Mrs. Corteen said, "He should be put up before a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I won't see more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when it was 12. October 2002 detonated shortly after 11 p.m. a powerful charge placed in the outside parked van.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier the suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" for doctors three times.
Mr. Hughes said that Pateka should suffer the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell, Jama Islam, responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keep him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where, less than four months later, US forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between the Southeast Asian and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups.
"He didn't come willingly," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he had felt no regret for how much grief he had caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year, which will include the Bali and Australian ceremonies.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the judgment.
Pope Francis to appoint the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis 22. in February, it will first appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church as soon as the Pope, and are the ones who vote for the Pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men to eventually help select his successor.
He is now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – the group shrinking to 120 voting cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistory would be held before the new cardinals' a solemn elevation.
"Pope Francis has decided to give his decision to convene the February Consistorium in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices told the Catholic Voices that the number of voting cardinals would probably drop by February.
He said the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he needed to raise the number of electors to rise to 120, and as many cardinals in excess of the age of 80, as many cardinals as he wanted.
The consistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is some orientation towards Europe of Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope has made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said it was "totally possible" that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is absolutely new.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted bishops from big places as cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprise - so we don't know who he's appointing."
Announced series of Race Series
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an intercom equipment.
The choice is for improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logosical support and vehicle storage between the different races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director at Bowler Motorsport, said, "Turkish participants in the races coming to the Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world class races.
We are pleased to offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare the contestants for the hardness and reality of the Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strings of Autumn
The saxophone giant and jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will dot next Wednesday for the 18th edition of the Strings of Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform in the Grand Hall of the Lantern on November 6 with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra will feature a Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of power, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he worked with extends from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
He also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawinel on his musical journey, with whom they gave the direction of the new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than one decade.
He has been performing in particular with the Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
A kind of after-party after the festival will still be the club's Spotlight night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD.
Alongside the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Czech audience will be presented with the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronica and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation of the Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of pronouncements, they sent out planes, hitting the target and returning.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and no longer comment.
The exact opposite of the confused and grandiose, the actions of Obama's unshielded Syrian politics.
And the happiest of the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media of their claim that a "Syrian base" or "deliveries for Hezbolah" were bombed.
I wrote here recently that while US aid to the secular insurgents in the country remains only on the rhetorical level, Russia is happily continuing to supply Syria's arms.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that was the target of an Israeli airstrike.
Clear message.
And note, Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, though, according to popular online theories, it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has honoured 2 members of the spacing force, probably Delta force.
It had not been said until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the American Consulate in Bengazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city is known, and I think they were members of the CIA's secret squadron, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA's elsewhere-arranged residence.
It is clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (it's the same one of those, the two SEALs members were killed after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the attack in Bengazi, they volunteered for the hit and, together with five private contractors, shot their way to the CIA compound in Bengazi.
The Obama administration is blamed by the fact that during that attack, the commando was not deployed officially and whole, and that there was simply a hesitation to do.
The commando commander, so without orders, he's likely to release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that there are not one-off but permanently American commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors are operating in the country is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, nothing of the sort of thing was officially admitted, and even now they're just talking about a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US, even if it is half-atengil, to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although to resolve the nationwide situation, it would take a much greater help.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not long ago, the media almost praised Iran's air forces for the prosecution of American drones.
But little is known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to be able to discover your drone in the airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if the Iranians are discovered by a drone in an international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it was that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chased by an American drone in the international space above sea level, when the first sharp deployment of the American super-fighter F-22 Raptor in history took place.
He passed for Phantom to visually verify his weaponry without being registered by Phantom on the radar or simply noticing it, and then suddenly appearing by him and inviting the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without grumbling.
No wonder when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to Raptor.
Court blocked order on the process of stopping and searching persons by the police department of NY
The Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday blocked a court order calling for changes to the program to be stopped and searched at the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. appeals federal court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program to stop and question people.
The city challenged its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to the police department to change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge had to be removed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges, by not acting as a judge, as a judge, according to the requirement to avoid appearances of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which she openly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to halt and search people.
It has set up independent surveillance to oversee major changes including reform of procedures, training and surveillance, and to order the launch of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the naming method of preserving the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled to take place sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of stopping and searching people was criticized by the ranks of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been a halt and search of people for about a decade, but the recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose dramatically to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are among the minorities, were drafted in a lawsuit that arose as a group suit.
Supporters of changes to the Permission and Search program by the Police Department in the NY claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and influence how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents claim that the changes will reduce police morality, but not criminality, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve the wider problem, with the police force under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she had not ended the practice of stopping and searching the persons that was constitutional, but she had reformed the way the searches were carried out by the police department in NY.
CDC Center issues schools guidelines on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of child-based food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives to be issued by the US government, owing to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children rose by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directives contain information for schools on how the teaching staff and the staff to inform about child food allergies and how to respond to the allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline at their disposal – the EpiPen automatic injection is most often used – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more simply.
The report also contains a list of the typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's been in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "She'll tell me the tongue."
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered a registration on the Tipsport.cz website.
But I didn't finish it afterwards, because there was someone at the branch who couldn't finish the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration expired, then I moved, and as a result, my ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't do it because I had a different OP number, the address and that I just couldn't finish it and that I should ask for the data to be deleted and made a new registration.
So I did that and on 24.10.2013 I wrote in technical support that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
At that, a short-footed day, she wrote me a technical support to finish the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails in technical support, where they eventually wrote after the 4th urgacis on October 25 of October that the personal data had been deleted at my request.
One would therefore think that he could make the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I am not getting deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end they also excluded this).
So I used a different username and it jumped to me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something they said they had erased?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When asked how it was possible to write back to me that the personal data had actually been deleted on October 25 and to send an email with the bug.
I did that (yesterday around 3 p.m.) and on that they wrote back today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why I cannot, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been contacting technical support for a week and I'm dealing with them that I still can't.
And what does it matter that if what is true is true (such as not) could not be registered by anyone with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
I actually registered in the same 1:02 p.m. on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictitious e-mail and a phone number and wonder of the world, the page appeared that they sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is this possible if it is not possible to register in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to e-mail and phone number and just didn't disable the data as he claims.
So I once again communicated this technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or or they don't know what they're writing) because what they write is not true.
I documented several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. so the "false" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote off a curt sentence for me - I'm sorry, but we can't check your claims again by registering.
And he stopped communicating.
In fact, it repeats the same sentence that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it didn't really take place.
So if I summarize it, Tipsport not only has not deleted the data as they claim, but is still lying when it says otherwise.
What makes it even worse is that it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after the launch of this matter on my personal blog, things were set in motion a bit and the Technical Support received an e-mail that the matter was being passed on for examination and would be informed (after a week of ammunition and arguing and warning of the same error).
We are sorry to kill, but we are innocent, defends the leaders of the Khmer Rouge
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khhmer Roughem Islands hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism from 1975 to 1979, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunishment, disease, torture, and executions of more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population of the time.
This commander of the notorious S-21 prison was given a life prison in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the nation's best interest and unaware of the true extent of the killing.
"It's easy to say that I should have known, understood everything, and thus intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think that I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "take people to be mistreated or killed to deny them food or commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost eleven relatives to the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"You don't care about the other," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subordinates wouldn't kill," she added, noting that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge were "worse than monsters."
The "Foreign Minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, was also due to appear before the court, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then-Famed Social Affairs, was founding an incapacitated trial in September 2012 for dementia.
The Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British entrepreneur has made the first ice cream to be shone in the dark - using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
The idea came up when he read a dopey on the jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes luminosity.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue - increasing the pH level of the protein and then causing it to be radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, which is why the more you lice, the brighter the brightening.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (soil, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing fabric, but when it comes to making, we're at the beginning, so for GBP 200 you get about 2g of this fabric."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream begins to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months and seems to be a great idea for Halloween to celebrate because it's causing this fantastic shining effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the lumines of jellyfish are four times more expensive than gold.
And so every scoop costs me about £10.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental Bristol-based company is known for its unconventional flavours of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is set to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish to make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible because of the refractor of light caused by the ice crystals that make the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice creams use the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Ski resorts want to make it cheaper for families with children
Oil price plummets further to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories was offset by a report that showed the boost of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The US oil pointer for December deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European e-commerce trading on the New York trade exchange on the New York trade exchange.
Thursday, the decline was 39 cents, and it was 5.8 percent short of the month of October.
Rich oil reserves have been burdening the price in the past few weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US inventories had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, inventories have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, the two reports of Chinese manufacturing came to the impetus for more demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after the growth in the previous two weak decades of up to 7.8 percent in the third quarter.
Brent crude oil, an indicator for international oil also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the International Trading Exchange in London.
Martin Doktor on problems with the Sochi Olympics: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The buns of his mouth are indicated by a slight smile, and then he exhales, with a deep breath, "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the Sochi 2014 Olympics organizing team is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
What was at the last Olympics, we can forget.
"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A number of things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much from the point of view of delivering information on essential things.
Perhaps we have been lecturing from them for three months to deliver how the individual villages will be officially designated, so that we can do a whole series of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
They're always communicating in a lot of things.
Is the Olympic Village at least already built?
But it's not a disastrous state anymore.
A month ago, we walked around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Only the basic concrete, that's what the state was a month ago.
But they still have time.
While there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a vanguard, he will still smell of glue.
And if they're late, what?
President Putin would you think of him hitting the military there?
That's probably how it's gonna be.
Just to make it not that the Olympic Village = Potemkin villages.
Rather, they are in danger of not making a route finish, for example, and not delivering the details.
Maybe they'll have the roads in such a state that we'll have to take our boots from the London games.
But I believe they'll get it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Perhaps the figure skaters will probably ride in the trio they went out.
No one has to doubt about speed skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still going to go to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'm not due to fly there until January 26th.
What the houses in the Olympic Village will look like, we know.
We even measured some of the things ourselves on the subway so as not to believe just sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports, plus I am doing a normal agenda in the sense of communication with the Sochi Organising Committee.
Instead of a post-election sirloin, a post-election stew
The October elections brought a bunch of losers rather than the winner.
It is not just parties that have not even made it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous governing parties (ODS, TOP 09) and ultimately the ČSSD because of its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-filled candlelit weekend with a post-election stew.
The rally of the election was the Andrej Babiš movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance to date.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party plays into the political (again)given the credit of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported or elected to the House of Commons.
The president may have lost a strategic lead over other politicians because of the unpleasant incident, but he still has a few ways to get it back - for example, by selecting a future prime minister.
While the CSSD is moving away from the chances of winning the premiership in my eyes, the businessman Andrej Babiš is on the contrary closer.
Post-election developments are so far miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by the Communists, this development is better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Given the ANO's vocal opposition to team up with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the most likely option for the coalition of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the CSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak piece of parterre in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite dismal for the CSSD.
The Minority Government of the ČSSD composed with the "Net-Schanovs" at the Castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Do we not be self-acting for the next early election?"
Another election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the ANO vote.
The GOP's plans to introduce sector taxes, increase in income taxes, or the building of a state-owned bank have been hopefully plunged under the table.
The ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit parties, on the other hand, agree, for example, on business support, a moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, to reduce the lower VAT rate of the VAT rate for the selected goods.
Friction surfaces occur most in the view of the social policy and the size of the state.
But ANO now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition so far, the ANO, the ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be leaning rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result in the end than the left-wing tax program on everything that is still moving in the economy.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted an early election.
The reasons were given for corruption, the squandering of money for overpriced purchases and state contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that this condition was suited to most citizens.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the state that was (the logging and in-depth of this state).
Otherwise, I can't explain to myself that 3,413,497 voters did not turn out to vote, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09 38,4124 voters voted for the ODS in total, and a total of 4,394,028 in general support of the original ruling coalition, representing 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is a supermajority.
When I add 1,016,829 GOP voters to the aforementioned parties, then with the old order (because all of the above parties were involved in the "harvesting" and the indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed to this state of affairs.
In fact, this made it clear that they were not in favour of punishing the culprits of the state's theft and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think the members of the GOP who participated in it will work on the proper laws?
Is it even to help us?
Olomouc to open public ice rink in historic centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas and winter skating markets, Pavel Spálený, said that the preparatory work at the rink had started on the 26th. October and from Wednesday, an ice generator is in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimetres thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The rink has an area of 375 square metres, the stage took 358 square metres.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stalls with a punch.
"We have extended the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stalls and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so that the skaters can comfortably change," Spálený described.
The streets of Olomouc already resemble the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed to repair the Lower Square directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed in the late summer, so the ice sheet could return to its original location.
People were first able to skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will be launched in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.
Scientists have more enlightened how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Earlier research has shown that joyful dogs waggle their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tail mostly to the left.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can record and respond to these subtle differences in tail movements.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said, "With people, it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, dogs are the right side of the brain responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs react to the asymmetric wagging of other dogs' tailings, the researchers were monitoring the animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes one way, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We have scattered dogs films about dogs - whether in the natural version or in the form of silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and represent it more to the right or the left."
When the animals saw the otherwise bland dog moving the tail to the right (from the view of the tail-rolling the dog), it remained perfectly still.
But when she recorded the tail-catching the tail mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a tail-written dog), their heart rate increased and the animals looked insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that the dogs consciously communicated through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which moves they have to take and which they do not have to look out for.
He said: "If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behaviour and movement to the right begets less friendly behaviour, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog conduct expert John Bradshaw, a university lecturer at veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and the right side was important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left as they watched the aggressive dog and on the right when they were looking at a cheerful dog.
And in a further scholarly treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said, "Watching a robot with a dog robot, the dogs were more likely to get acquainted when it was wagging the tail to the left than the right, when they were becoming more uncertain - quite the opposite to the Italian study."
The difference, he said, may be due to the fact that dogs in these various studios did not interpret animals in films or dog robots as quite as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help.
"Although in the case of many different mammals, there are strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and the dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes one way on one side and another at another time.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royalinian Scottish Bank (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global investigations by the inspection authorities regarding suspicious monetary market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders in question would be the first RBS employees suspended as part of the widening investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR manipulation scandal (London's interbank interest rate).
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless search is continuing on this matter and we are cooperating fully with FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said that RBS had given the British financial behaviour records of emails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European President of Foreign Mute Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chairman of the cash trading in Citi, took a holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any misdemeanor.
Mr Usher's group for sending the fast news included the Barclays and Citigroup bankers, said the people of the initiation to the event.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against one of its employees, following the Swiss supervisory body, Finma, that it had tried to investigate suspicious machinations in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six offices – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority, Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining the allegations that these bankers were in league to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are being scorched with years-old quick messages and emails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the largest profit-making engines in investment bank closures in past years, but which was disrupted by the small volatility of currencies to limit opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that a large and highly liquid foreign currency market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the substantial volume of daily foreign currency trading, the liquidity bising on the various trading firms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to have an effect on the market at relatively low prices."
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired from its stock trading department to a trader that caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the relevant authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse.
He negotiated the government with both Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen deputies in the election, or only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to argue with the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who debuted the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats and Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
It will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal then," Kasal says, estimating how this year's talks will unfold.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35), from the town of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a cup of beverage between the thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to accusations of driving carelessly and inattentively.
He received seven points on his account, which resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the cost of £90, and the surcharge for the accused was £100.
Sleep: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have a juice, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospal, the family has always come first, so he wants to submit to her in full submission at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and he'll extend his career, or he'll definitely quit hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who will never cheat anything.
Despite the fact that he always lets his heart out on the ice and can pull his teammates off.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus's most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still there," he says firmly.
He may have, reportedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who failed to make the season, and they have injured two backers - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like with your arrival at the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dwelling on it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that I should be signed, but that's all.
Nowhere was it added that it had indeed happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't you even get back from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's the idea of getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, say, a player gets injured or someone can't do it and the team doesn't step up.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, that's the situation that's the situation that's going on, right?
The injured man is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make the season, so there's some chance, don't you think?
Of course, the odds are always there.
The second thing, though, is you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received one yet.
Unfortunately, that is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you in anticipation that something might work out after all?
I've got the expectations since 5. July, when the NHL's free-tour market opened up, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to be reminded of yourself?
I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sunshine and seeing you again.
Do you have a schedule planned in any way?
That's because I'm the father and the husband, and that's where it all comes from.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of daddy and husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday, Vasik has two hockey games, that's a holiday for me and my whole family to go support our children in what they want to do.
Wondering you could do this in a full-time quotation mark?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This, too, can happen.
I tried it out three years ago when I missed 50 fights for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
Someday it's going to be in a phase that all the goals, victories and passes won't make up for you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Let's have whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it for the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - apart from the family - is also a sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's where the family life is based on.
My children, I mean, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we'd love to be on this trend.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves, in America, the options are somewhere else.
We should offer them such a chance.
So are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we'll do.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia in the Czech Republic and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter, back in Tampa or where our steps take us.
It's perfect being warm all the time.
I've been extremely lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey in turn offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I could choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who are hungry for this to choose what to do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will to toil, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. That desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it's going to stay.
It's impossible to plan.
So you could say that this season you wait for it to be how it goes and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage where I'm going by day.
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasies about extraterrestrial life on earth are not the themes that the American saxophonist Wayne Shorter would pitch casually.
In the conception of his quartet, which will culminate in the grand hall of the Prague Lucerna in the grand hall of the Strings of Autumn, this year's edition of the Strings of Autumn, everything is related to everything.
The fragmentary of the quartet of the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film paintings.
This principle, however, the newly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-time Grammy winner, a former teammate of Miles Davis and, now, arguably the largest living jazz saxophonist - reluctantly explains.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then they get disappointed when things go differently," Shorter says.
Jagr joked: Goal from the breaker?
He got the puck in the defensive zone and was never caught.
He also converted the leak after a quick forehand loop.
Jaromir Jagr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night, the 119th NHL-based goal was commented on the social networking site Facebook.
"After viewing this video, the director of Czech Railways contacted my agent Petr Svoboda and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" Jagr wrote at the outset with an exaggeration.
They say we're a very much typecast.
I guess I'll have to quit my night practice so I don't accelerate any more.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense might call in afterwards and he'd like to advertise for the jets!" he added with the smiley faces.
In addition, New Jersey claimed its second win in a row.
"Ms Above all, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova is working," Jagr concluded.
Brutal murder of senior citizen in Zlín to be re-litigated by regional court
The regional court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men pleaded not guilty.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court overturned the regional decision and returned the matter for consideration.
The reasons behind the judge were declined to comment, saying the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the teenagers attacked a 79-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a harrowing death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled him, beat him and kicked him all over his body, and also fitted him with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol, in the head with a metal object.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures to the skull, swelling of the brain or the bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to at the scene.
The teenagers reportedly took about 3,000 crowns from the house and jewellery worth about 14 thousand crowns.
According to the regional court, they were the only, moreover, only circumstantial evidence against the defendants' scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of the legal instructions.
The scent of the crime scene and other items coincided with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, however, the police initially treated them as factual and not scent traces.
In addition, there were certain errors in the handling of them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was not established without a doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead elderly man with a smudged head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The violent death was not even highlighted by the called emergency services doctor.
It was only after a few days that the criminals were contacted by Olomouc doctors who discovered the signs of a violent death during the autopsy.
Police were no longer able to work with all the traces of the crime scene, which had been cleared by the relatives.
No DNA was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišťsko.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was finally confirmed by the Delhi High Court last year.
The man, he said, was the head of an organized group of six teenagers who were responsible for the jewelry store robbery.
The robberies happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior citizen in Slopna.
The younger of the accused of murdering the elderly lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gather the documentation of the castle retinederation.
In the past, the traditional influence of such an Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
True, the editors stood up for the management.
The cases described, however, do not answer the question of where such attachment to the Squire's so-called journalists come from - whether it is a response to a direct order or, lest we use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of outright empathetic.
And when we assume a general rottenness, one cannot forgive one for questioning whether other, equally unscrupulous, unscrupulous interests of power that have not yet been given the opportunity to change their circumstances in television.
It is true for those who say that in developed countries, the obvious attempts to intervene politicians are not on the air.
But the truth is also that this does not mean that complaints to public media do not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise mainly what they see as the tenderness inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have simply not reached this civilisation stage yet, and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps, in a country that thinks of itself as being the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about evil politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of a messy situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings comes up against.
As crowds of horse-dragon experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Mountain of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet attending school and only a few months ago has taken his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, have gone smoothly for three rounds to eventually win the grand prize and leave behind in 30 protracted adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – with the same height - were praised for their appearance, and in their appearance, and style at the annual Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He faced the gentlemen and ladies in the elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle, and had his two-year-old Toffee paddled out of the circuit.
The faenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control the horse, far outstripping his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony a day since.
His mother, Donna (30), said, "Fenton and Toffee work together brilliantly."
They didn't have high hopes, but they eventually left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
They all thought of him as phenomenal and complete strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
The boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt, Sharon Howells, who has been showing off her horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded."
He ran across the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and was in charge of two chickens.
Considering the way he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition again soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse-draining contest said, "Fentons are only three, but he already knows how to control the pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork between the pony and the one who runs it is – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the adorable outfit, he really fitted in with him.
Snowden is willing to "co-work" with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch at the US intelligence services, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over the evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to provide answers to questions about her activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who was forwarded to the media by the MP in Berlin on Friday, reads: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as frieves and seeks to criminalise political speeches with difficult lawsuits that do not give room for the defence."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that supporting the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the charges of criminal offences against him.
The charges filed by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German officials, we will find a way to enable it."
Tensions in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise as claims were alleged that the NSA had tapped in Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who is running a parliamentary panel oversees news coverage, said that if there was any opportunity to interview Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and that relations with the US are completely destroyed," should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
He was accompanied on his trip to Russia by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need to be assured that he would be "failure" there, the member of parliament said.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he had faced a rough and sustained campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world's reaction to his "act of political expression" gave him courage.
Citizens in the whole and senior officials – including those in the United States – assessed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Not to choke on hate
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After reading, he lived but did not write, published by the CLAV KAHUDA (1965) of the new novel, The Darkness, the Present.
That it will not be a slender volume is suggested by the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu was interviewed by another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What did it move that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - not to brag about the hatred.
To see new and new clones around you of all, the human foolish pettiness, the young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavor.
I'm not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless lust, the rowdy souls, and the opposite of the overpopped ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the air of a small saleable whores.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jubilant friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from my life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then read books at the bedside in the evening.
You're talking about feeling frustrated, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, just as we all are?
The break came a long time ago, at about the age of ten.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, that's what I did to live after.
Somewhere inside, however, there's still a surprised, quiet boy.
I see more lone practitioners, each in their tornado of anxieties.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm attending this giant, thousands of years of moving of the system of life on this planet - the birth of the elusive future.
That immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when the trial-and-error creates more and more generations of beings who, in the billiards of interactions per second, create some superhuman, alumbo, of the intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a rolling process, or did you start from scratch?
The speaker, or rather the dialogue that is conducted by the right and the left half of the brain, occasionally floats to the surface and is shaped into a book.
As peace periods are laced with quiet sleeping metastases of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the mute avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I do nothing, one day it will humble me softly.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and asks the layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness."
Neokortex, a grey cortex, asks older evolutionary formations, going to the ancient ringtone tree of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the snakes, seeks the answer in the flight of the birds, raises his gaze to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heaven over me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
You're relatively often metaphorically speaking to the ego - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores on its billions of connections and electrochemical links all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has endured.
This forest is using the logical and emotionally displayed and branching trees of information, the registers of memory, the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to ever-changing presence, in a relentless effort to sense and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload malfunctions.
By analogy - as if you "fell up" a PC, from a language emulator program and a foreign language translator program, you would first be entangled in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarters, it ended up with a darkly green-glowing Bios screen, a basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what they are talking about - I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why do you regularly care about this kind of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the doposc of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a breakage will appear.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He stared into the abyss for so long, until the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that a person is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "die" and a new quality comes in.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer the parables.
Once one had fallen into the pool and drowned, running for days, months and summers, and he was still drowning and reading, and the books had taught him to swim - to live, that is.
He became a "diver."
Perhaps someone's sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, of the particular person who will read your text?
The one who cannot be told meaningful, some call it a consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterised by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is involved directly in the process of word and phrase formulation."
From his early teens he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nemo, running around the Shadows in the dark streets.
In the end, in the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their messages, is the "Sun of the Clear Worlds of others, Karel Hynek Mácha."
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back bounce that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, even years later, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are actually "life" or, rather, "worlds."
They are encoded in the characters of the letters, they bear the experience, the history of the regions of each language.
At any time we can bring them to life if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonic books, we are committing witchcraft.
After the book is published, you are - as it is - awaiting a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Will you get into it again with joy, or do you feel differently after years?
Today I just like to tell the story.
And what did I find in the process?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic sign - they are inconspicuous, they don't draw too much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiated, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give you an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived was (and I hope still live) a curly bookchaker (called the aptly Cervenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl's bull.
In one leech, he presented me with individual articles of a string of readers of my book Houština.
I stared into their eyes, and then I was shown a rooted, read-quidated specimen of my book.
Embarrassed, I put down the just-read sausage and wept briefly in a manly.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and tearing drunkenly with emotion.
Then the young blond half-nation couldn't stand it, and roared, leaping headfirst out the window into the snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night's countryside and the sick of the lucky rabies of the sensitive, the aching of the countrymen's aching soul, and the homesickness of the backstre patriots - howling and braying like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is, formally and content, different from the previous ones.
Is this also true of the text, the wind, the darkness, the present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about a land behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novella Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian myth in the people's healer: At the Sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
There's a dog, a gray chest on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps, a long time ago, we were devils in hell and drew lots - what role we would play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or will you leave it back on a free influx of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a marvellous way of dialogue.
Something of the vast and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, is influenced by our will from such depth and in such a wide manner that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, with utmost self-evident, we act in the terms of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a malfunction happens and we give out compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the ocean coast of the unconscious, and catching the tides of warm wind into the leaky sailing from a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, it will be necessary to study at least one of Shakespeare's plays, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include a "hidden text" to encourage deeper reading;
The combined courses in English literature and language will be cancelled.
As of 2015, students will be required to have a graduation certificate on the language and be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Education Ministry should issue a new curriculum tomorrow for English and Mathematics – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other crucial subjects are expected to be changed next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, it will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with the new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a "broad consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society," and that we need to insist that the graduation exam is "more demanding, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
By way of comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours a year to mathematics and to Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official request to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive graduation exam in mathematics - together with a greater emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra classes.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the one with cancer in the CSSD
Prior to the election, the long-froning controversial litigant sparked to the full outdoors fighting for influence within the Ostrava-based ČSSD.
It all came to a head when the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court for the undemocratic formation of the candidates.
Nevertheless, the players in the case did not want to say too much to avoid damaging the party even more before the election.
But now the votes are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava-based ČSSD called on the Mayor of Ostrava to leave the party on Monday evening and will probably push for him to lose his post as well.
But Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the controversy is up to and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with the Journal.
How do you view the outcome of the election?
The CSSD was certainly counting on a much better result.
Did it hurt our country to have disputes within the party before the elections?
I imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it fits the state of the CSSD's now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, is mentally ill and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
The ODS has been going through the decline for some time, I think, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is the case that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends with the ODS, have moved to the people of the CSSD and have influence over them.
This is then related to the fact that the Ostrava Municipality's offices are visited by the police and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only made up of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think of their own good in the first place.
The CSSD is divided into two implacable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But that, too, had been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hashk wing gradually filled its positions so that after the election it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
One is in a situation in politics where one sometimes has to compromise.
But everyone has some internal boundaries where the compromises can't be made, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I was seeing the whole thing within the party, I made a deal with Luboš Zaoralek to try to get on the regional ticket to strengthen Sobotka's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hashk's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
Slávek Sobotka, in my view, is a man who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to some extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I confess I have not heard anything like this from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can just start sacking the party chairman.
This is a power struggle, regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now done in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How you perceived that the Ostrava-based leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you on the ballot.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who will be positioned by their members.
The contest should for the most part be based on program visions and the abilities of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision, but a political party is a lift for them to make money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruffy, breaking the rules.
They make their practices out of the political parties of the Mafia and, in my view, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start to respect the statutes.
That's why you filed a motion with the court before the election for a preliminary injunction against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is consolidating its power by the fact that the non-compliant organizations can abolish it, purposefully establishes new organizations, gradually firing inconvenient party members.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rescinded the resolution to dismiss him.
This shows that, while seeking to uphold the party's statutes through the courts is the last resort, it is the only option at the moment when the other ways and control authorities within the CSSD have ceased to function.
The Ostrava-based ČSSD leadership, headed by MEP Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, is keen on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they get the votes, and for those votes, they consolidate their power in the party.
Going back to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me.
It was artificially staged to be described as a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought the property, which is strategically of its value.
So how do you see it further with your continued presence as mayor?
The district committee has already invited me and even more people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch a thief!
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who will initiate and enforce, sometimes against the party's members, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than getting in the way of the others to make their way to the places they want.
Will you fight these efforts in any way?
Because if this republic is going to work well, then political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively run the state if they can't even manage themselves.
So I'm not thinking of leaving the GOP now, because I think the one who causes this side's cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to drive me out.
We want to show that Plzeň can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been doing well in the lead recently, Viktoria Plzen's defender or midfielder, František Rajtoral, has a form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He is also doing well, with the activity of the thrive, after a tackle on him he was cut in a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached the final two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end they took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break the unpleasant streak in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the Saints, who play offensive football.
Everything is going to the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative attracts the fans to the stands of the Doosan Arena.
Plzeň's last matches have not worked out as they would have liked, but the word of the crisis is rejected by the Victory defender.
That's the way football is, sometimes you're in good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any case.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the West Indies defender.
The Victory team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's played on Friday night, and that's how I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to both Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called in open letters from students, educators and the management of secondary and higher education in several regions to defend the academic freedoms before the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at the schools.
I was meeting with more or lesser success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who turned down a lecture by the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received rematches in the form of not being invited to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer brave and made the visit to Miloš Zeman possible: the Technical University in Brno, the Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, the University of Business in Ostrava, the Commercial Academy in Cologne, the J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now seeing in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of policy at universities.
The newly elected ODS MP, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, finds it normal.
Professor, this is really not the same as staying in the position of mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the GOP's governors who are simultaneously recruiting the position of MP and the governor and, like, they downgrading both professions?
You are telling people that you can manage both of these demanding functions with the left-back.
I know, we have here the example of Michal Hašek, who manages even a few dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly an example of the person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post in order to devote herself fully to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's office is that by the concurring functions, you will be violating the apoliticality of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current tenure in both posts as an advantage for the University.
"You will be able to help your school, however, without remaining the dean.
I think a similar view to my opinion and the rector Miroslav Ludwig will have a similar opinion, so will your students.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count it for you in the next election.
And that may not last long.
John Kerry admitted: Spying went too far!
The United States has occasionally gone "too far" in the spying, US diplomatic chief John Kerry admitted to AFP during a video conference between Washington and London.
But collecting information, according to the minister, was used to avert terrorist attacks.
The AFP's "First Reach of Washington" was echoed in the midst of fierce controversy on both shores of the Atlantic over the scandalous revelations about mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), targeted by the American Allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the previous practice.
The collection of information, he said, was essential to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, the Madrid bombings in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented the planes from falling, the buildings exploded and the people were murdered because we were able to be informed about the rails in time," Kerry pointed out.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone unreasonably far."
The US intelligence affair, which allegedly tracked hundreds of millions of telephone calls, erupted in Europe earlier this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans had also watched the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to ban or significantly restrict surveillance.
The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's (YMCA) Christian Association (YMCA) had been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for Sexual Child Relationship has learned that before the 2011 allegations against child educator Jonathan Lord Lord of Caringbah were charged with sexual abuse of children.
But it was said before the panel that in its opening statement to the commission, the association said that they had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organisation.
Chief Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the employees of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another, when a gym teacher in Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 of the sexual harassment of children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's adviser, that he knew of the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initial statement by YMCA was also inaccurate, stating that external audits were being conducted in the YMCA to award the organisation as a leading supporter of children's rights.
The evidence presented by the panel is that the YMCA has been alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of the four possible assessments in an audit by the Ministry of Education and Society in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the management himself had failed downwards from himself when Lord was accepted, without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he committed during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a breach of child safety by the Lord.
Members of the staffers gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including the Lord being alone with the children, watching them privately, leaving them sitting on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because of his behavior, she testified that Jacqui Barnat, the children's service manager at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often hard to talk to him about."
The director general said he did not accept the evidence of the staff, that they felt uncomfortable if they were to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said he had given his opinion to the YMCA board in New South Wales that the "Jonathan Lord's case" for the organization was that the staff had "undered no report" to him, and the council agreed to it.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged, the general manager for the children's services at the YMCA organization, Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid disruption of the evidence, but it was "overly zealous" and ill-conducted.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, vetting, processing, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
President of the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green for Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measures, will save substantial amounts for heating, but also for the builder for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring the state more than 2700 new jobs created.
In terms of the fiscal policy of the state, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow for the further continuation of the programme so that further calls can be announced within it.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological achievements on airplanes (but they are not allowed to call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from the gateway" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, gaming, watching movies, and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Passengers, however, are not to expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary from airve to airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta told a press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA administration how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and have updated the on-board crew training manuals and the Directive for the storage of equipment in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain logs the permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane descends to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft, which have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at a higher altitude altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards' Association, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as the new rules are implemented safely – and we will work closely with the transport companies on this – it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
We are, frankly tired of looking like "watchers."
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and texts or downloading data will remain banned for less than 3 kilometres of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aerial mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble-type game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, was thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears that they might hurt someone if they float around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for mobile phone use are determined not by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they can potentially create interference with the navigation devices, but we also know from the FCC data that they can cause the jamming of the transmitters in the air," Rosenker said.
The FAA industry advisory board set up to raise the issue to examine the problem was proposed last month for the government to allow the wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been underperceive pressure to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, argue that there is no rightful security ground for the ban.
Restrictions are also finding it increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is pervasive.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers also forget about the obligation to disable or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical achievement of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed, and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
The plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huertová said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasting than in previous generations' devices.
For example, e-readers issue only minimal broadcasts when a site is turned over.
But the broadcast is more powerful when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those who are pushing to relax restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers, is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the airliner with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem emerged.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aeronautical Passenger Association said he believed the interference with these facilities was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only snippet messages from pilots to support the fact that such devices could cause air systems to be discharged, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device during the device's flight by instrument with low visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and is, in its view, a sensible procedure for the travelling public, using the technology to a large extent.
"We are delighted to have acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with security," said Roger Dow, managing director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the US defense stance on his surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage "has gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for the fact that, in light of the harsh revelations about the NSA's espionage activities, which emerged through the informant Edward Snowden, they had acted as a "car-copilot."
The leaked information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, via a video-commpatort to the open government conference in London, said, "There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the Government have actually learned about some of the things that have been done out of inertia, because that possibility was, referring to the Second World War, the difficult Cold War period and, of course, on 9/11."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and is already conducting a thorough review to ensure that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this trial.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA sought good, and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We are seeing a new world in which people are willing to detonate themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to murder and blow up people and attack governments.
And what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing down, buildings not exploded, and people are not executed because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that US lawmakers were preparing to respond to foreign concerns about alleged American espionage and to convince Europeans that they must continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week, and that he was worried about their threats to stop their participation in counter-terrorism organizations because they were disillusioned with the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is really important for the national-security interests of the US that Europe remains with us in the same boat, with a view to the joint efforts to combat terrorism, Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the presiding judge of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs of foreign relations, said in an interview.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their rage over the NSA's programmes.
News in the media that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some of America's allies, even though the agency's chief executive said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the incomprehension of metadata collected and shared with the United States by NATO allies.
Another revelation was quoted as saying by documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had tracked German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and as many as 34 more world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the Allies' espionage as necessary and said it was a routine matter on both sides.
In the center of the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year and hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators who intend to participate are to be published in the coming days.
He said the program was still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the aim of the trip was to help repair relations, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would be ready.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people in terms of the espionage programs they have used for years themselves.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also recognize the fact that we are not the only ones doing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is on schedule this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the animosity sparked by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American surveillance activities.
The words 'Mugabe is a limp donkey' no longer in danger of jail, court annulled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be very careful about the talk in public of the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at the forefront since late 1987.
Under section 33 of the Criminal Code, the disrespect of the presidency was punishable by a fine of $100 to one year in prison.
"State representatives should not be keen to blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, the British BBC reported.
The law was loudly outspoken by Zimbabweans, among them Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist who ended up in public in prison with a "lifulous donkey" in public.
In August, the prosecutor charged the 26-year-old man for his intention to use a poster with the face of Robert Mugabe as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later turn out to be false," said Deputy Attorney General Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who releases false information to be sentenced to 20 years of prison.
"The audio for the law allowing the criminalisation of someone for a false statement has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Not to mention that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps away from the country's one-man dictatorship, he took in in 2009, when a deal between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the premiership.
Nevertheless, the country is still suffering from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government therefore completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is paid for only by currencies by other nations.
The impoverished economy is due to Mugabe's ill-considered agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redoled the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with the running of the farms.
Young couple mature to live with their parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the assignment to design the house on the plot, which lies on the corner of two streets, with the property itself somewhat sowing.
The requirement went on to say that the house would be home to two generations who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separate space.
The younger couple needed an extra small office.
The house is located on the corner of two streets and on a gently sloping plot of land.
The architects therefore decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
"We respected the family bundles, history and memories associated with the place in the design."
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths connected through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' household is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognisable from the outside, as they differ in different final facade treatment.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped with boards, the part where the office is held is white and the remaining elements have remained in the clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very intertwined with the exterior.
The parents' household, more specifically the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The intersection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues up to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climb the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the house's interior.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall cascading through them.
It was by this that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique to it.
The young couple's household is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room combined.
It is separated from the terrace by a glass wall with sliding doors.

The second floor is composed as one large open space that passes freely to the terrace, where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office on the top floor itself is designed in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant feature of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the front door, find themselves in the lobby and then climb up the stairs.
Fire crews arrived to rescue the lost puppy, which was stuck 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous outcropping in the quarry
The Kokršřisp Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, trapped in a quarry, he was spotted by a man walking the dog.
Firefighters rappelled down the cliff face to rescue the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire crews who came to rescue him after somehow imprisoning himself on a dangerous outcropping in a stone firing 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived alone for three days until he was freed from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson (25), and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit Quartom in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they frantically searched for their lost dog and posted the appeals on social networks.
At about 14.15 on Wednesday, a bystrenous dog-walker saw a stranded Ruby on a protrusion in a quarry in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station hurried to the scene and rappelled down to free Ruby, using an animal carrier bag to retrieve the rock.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team, Andy Clayton, said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall - 15 metres from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't flinch like a flap in the rescue -- he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
He was then given the cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team's technical commander, Peter Lau, said, "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and was all right besides exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid to look at the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in his arms.
The vet said that if he had gotten too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firemen were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
The refrigeration tower burned down at the ČKD industrial site in Prague at night
A large-capacity magazine was on fire in the ČKD industrial site in Prague, apparently a refrigeration tower, according to the fire department.
"Firefighters were already riding to the fire before 11 p.m. on Thursday, and they were still burning the fire this morning," said Prague fire department spokeswoman Pavlína Adamcová.
The amount of pollutants in the air nearby according to the measurements did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are as yet unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters arrived at the premises in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire at a large-capital reservoir, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing by means of a transport line from the tanks," she said.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing was complicated by a malfunctioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The firefighter's intervention commander issued a second fire alarm.
There are four degrees in total, while in the most serious situations the fourth is announced.
Chemists also rushed to the scene to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have been blown up in the fire.
"However, they did not focus on the air with a number of pollutants that would be above the hygiene standards," the fire department spokesperson said.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanship health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the moribund health service in Tasmania contains harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersee announced that the Australian Union was taking "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided following government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP, Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgeries at the request of the patient.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and cataract surgery, will help to remove the debt.
There is also money for free-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic systems of health records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinicians told me to help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Ms Pliberseková said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the Australian Union's money and report monthly where the additional funding was spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State supplies the services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be of no use to do 'as long as genuine reform was followed to lay a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system'.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for swift aid, which he first made in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal auxiliary package can emaciate the state's public health service from a critical condition," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly overturn the recent cuts.
Federal Health Opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's statement is just a "praying."
"The reason for me here is that the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which is donating $300 million to, and to pretend to be good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Ms Pliberseck to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package would be issued for a higher bureaucracy.
On the metro on the Bridge, there's music
Transportation Company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during the metro operation, is the A-line Bridge on the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The trial will last for six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos to ease the tension
Police specialists should be active in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their arches here.
They would keep an eye on order and solve problems.
Through their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from the shantytowns and the residents of the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior envisages this.
According to him, the situation in the country would be helped mainly by the "accelerated provision of social housing."
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 shantytowns and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were addicted to benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was roasted usury.
According to experts in the problem localities, meanwhile, the number of hundred more has been added.
Relations between their residents and others are heating up.
In several places, anti-Romani marches took place.
The extremists were joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the Interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghetto.
A crucial condition, he said, is "a retrospective application of equal access in law enforcement."
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would take errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest he would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee the order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better address the problems or offences.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a number of infringements," the Interior said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive bonuses, between CZK 500 and CZK 1,000 per month.
The introduction of special police officers to problem areas is to be paid for by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (approximately $15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations have started this year, a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbours.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the report's authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to be given by an analysis to determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year for these members after the end of the project.
According to the project's design, the selected police officers will first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
This training should undergo five dozen members a year.
They will produce the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers who will operate in the ghettos.
According to the authors, the situation would be helped mainly by social housing.
It should, he said, motivate and lead to integration.
Interior thought it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with strictly defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be given to social housing that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan to be put together by social workers.
They would have to abide by the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send their children to schools, retraining themselves and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would go to a higher standard of housing.
The permeable housing system should operate for at least 30 years, according to the Interior, until the next generation grows "integrationally-motivated environments."
The social housing model is prepared by the ministries for local development and work.
They're supposed to propose it by the end of the year.
Together with Bárta, an inspection has also arrested an analyst of the anti-corruption police
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was reported by the news server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon discovered that the case was taken up by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), its people were to arrest Barta in the center of Prague.
It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where the accused are police officers, but its authority also applies to civil persons.
According to MF DNES, among those arrested, one of the anti-corruption police officers - the lead analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek - is among those arrested.
He has worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, declined to comment on the information with the implication that the media must turn to GIBS on the matter.
But even her inspection spokeswoman Radka Sandorová did not want to say anything about the case, immediately referring to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of classified information," said the spokesperson of the prosecutor's office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
This unspecific response can also be inferred from the fact that the event took place, but it is in a regime of secrecy that does not allow the speakers to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even on this matter," but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
He was promoted to the post by Barta, together with former VV chairman Radek John, who was at the head of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute, which sparked uprooted over this between ex-Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV, even had to be dealt with by then-President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from on my person.
I wasn't contacted, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know about the matter," Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
It was officially promoted by Radek John, but the party's real leader was then just Barta.
Barta has now run for the Dawn elections, with a seat narrowly locking him - by 175 votes.
Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, said he had no idea what it was.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many of the parties on our ticket and, as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," Okamura distanced himself from Bárta, who said before the election that he gave Bart a run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the bailiffs.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former VV compatriot Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreigners with visa rights may undergo a "legitimate" test
As the government intends to extend the police crackdown, it is considering a "legitimate" test for foreign workers with a visa authorisation 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 programme from being used to fulfil unqualified jobs, or as a backdoor for the relocation of family and friends to Australia.
When a government debating article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
"The loud statements of the 'strangers at the end of the front' and 'work for Australians first' are a very unpleasant remnant remnant of the time when the unions demanded a protected labour market,' she told the Australian-Indic Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white labor force was to be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region had heard the echo of this historic artifact.
The discussion paper analyses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is in talks with officials for human smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest is left to consider.
If the criteria for "legitimacy" are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal association with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsor of the business."
After previous experience with businesses that have intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka seeking asylum has died of a suspected heart attack after arriving at the Christmas Islands this week on the Asylum Ship.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son travelled to Australia with him, and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat after his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities rushed with the man to the hospital on the Christmas islands where he died.
Israeli military aircraft attacked target in Syria, responsible official says
Israeli military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a responsible official for the administration confirmed to Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the target of Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel conducted an air attack on missile shipments in Syria.
From the villa she moved to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent a better part of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague's prettiest villa districts in Ořechovka.
The original owners of the house, however, recovered it in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance package.
Ivana was therefore quick to find alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
She received a tip from acquaintances for the apartment 3 + kk in an older panelled house on the opposite side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the view from the fourth floor to the extensive woodland park and dam excited me the other way," Ivana recalls of the first impression.
At first I thought it was going to be a makeshift for, like, three years.
"We have lived here for more than thirteen years today and I would not change not only for the gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter were then moving from a hundred-and-twenty-seven-footed apartment to a smaller apartment with an area of 62 m2 and gave out almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, the items were stored with friends, and the gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hall, and a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used a plasterboard to define the individual zones and the subdivision of the room, which allowed the new placement of the lights.
The first intervention she had committed to after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This transformed the apartment's layout to 2 + kk, but it got the room for airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improving the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for the laminate.
With the bathroom, Ivana didn't know what to do.
For years, I've taken out housing magazines and looked for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realisation.
On recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the available hall was also adapted at the same time.
The architect joined the toilet and bathroom area and replaced two doors with the opening wings with some sliding ones, saving the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently wheelchair accessible.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, plus a comfortable seat is in the shower, a bidet shower at the toilet.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued on.
As part of the show How to Build a Dream, there was a fast but fundamental transformation of the living room, which was also co-written by the architect Martin Čeněk.
In the space, which was created by the combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as half-cakes or Japanese walls.
"This would, as a result, violate the openness and unity of the space," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to separate the sleeping and living areas.
All you had to do was turn back the two sofa in and put a custom-made blanket box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the kitchen and dining area floor, the architect used a high-quality marsmoleum, bringing the sliding door to life with a pattern wallpaper.
The kitchenette is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper when needed.
The new anti-allergic marmolea floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer uncluttered cloudless surface and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings from the plasterboard highlighted in the colour is a demonstration of how to work with space in the block of flats.
I left the colours to the architects, I wished it was joyful.
"I like Orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The cladding of the graphog glass with the theme of a blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose a white one, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, the books were also placed in the space under the windowsill.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably operated remotely.
The redesigned interior features a great contrast of the new one with the older one, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier as well as quality art objects that Ivana has collected all her life.
The kitchen was the last one.
The cabinets had previously been placed on either side, and the owner felt a little like a tunnel.
The architect took away their number and rearranged the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is custom-made, the white area softens the slightly pearly surface.
The small space was accommodated thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen was revived by the all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
The unique grafoscoplo with the digitally printed theme is attractive, plus it is perfectly maintained.
Ivana chose magnolium flowers that remind her of the popular neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
The original bathroom contained a small bath and sink, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cladding.
The large shower has a glass Ronal door.
The task was to make the environment a clear, simple space in which the functions and devices would be in harmony.
We unified the interior in material and colour and attempted to make its elegant, cozy, not overly crowded look.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of objects of daily use," adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát reinstated the role of Chief Sister for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - the representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, the Minister of Health.
I respect the work of the nurses, and I think that the field of nursing is deserved to be given due attention by the Ministry.
The pursuit of this profession requires not only a high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal convictions.
"I'm afraid, and with all my responsibilities, I'll try to pursue those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilful nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who are not very helpful in their approach to patients to perform their authorization with all their empathy and help us improve the image of the sisters in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Main Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also said on the occasion of her appointment that she wanted to deal with various aspects of the job of nurse and intended to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, emerging, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I brazenly do not want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, with everyone having their own competences and, together with other healthcare professionals, forming a well-matched work team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties, and I intend to be involved in addressing them."
These include, for example, ensuring a simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks unnecessarily burden the nurses and take away from the time they could and should devote to patients instead," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding paths to co-operation with the team and with the management of health service providers, the arrangements for competences, as well as labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number in a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, but for fear of possible recourse, they are not documented on a specific case where the violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the Main Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee in this case to maintain the anonymity of such a complaint and have a specific case examined by the relevant authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Philosophical Faculty of Charles University in Prague's study programme Nursing - Pedagogy (absoldied in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the nursing and other non-medical fields and the recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
Throughout her professional career, she worked as a teacher at her bedside department, as well as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy principal for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several expert nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, devoted to lecturing activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional film quest and a rendering of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in France in the 1860s and tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When he rebells, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the reprehensibly perverted mother of the Superior, and for another, he becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lechery or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the viewers also experiencing an acelike wearing a horsehair.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big jump - a jump back a few years, to the memories, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "obligations" were mostly just a theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was a whole thing different - to come running from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Play ball games with the other kids, jump a shot.
Then, on Helen and Her boys, embropped with a chain stitch with a ceremonial tablecloth for her grandmother's birthday.
And only then, after several instances, to finally wash the dishes, vacuum, to fetch the wood to a tiled stove in the winter, and to do the tasks after dark under the lamp (or to rely on a classmate and instead of the tasks to write in love with school love).
In the morning, I'll have breakfast of homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which didn't even lie next to the strawberries) and to drink it with the tea of the dried herbs that my mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember the magic evenings, when it was the deathly silence in the nursery when my sister and I recorded the songs from the radio on the cassettes that were loudly filmed in the old tape recorder of my mom.
And then on the pencil, we rewaped the tapes and played one of the same songs over and over and over, our favorite, and toasted with a siphon.
Or we phoned across the table using cans that were tied with string - and while we're on the phone to be heard better, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, the ear-ears of the ear was a match at the time, the earl and cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even mobiles and laptops or designer clothes.
The dress was inherited from generation to generation, and the best "burn" into the wardrobe was a batik homemade T-shirt with SAVA.
From the electronics, the aforementioned mom's cassette was enough to be happy, and at most, Walkman, which we shared with our sister, which, by the way, we used only on the train on the school trip anyway.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Khboučka Hop or Man, Don't be angry, or as I've already said to go "just out."
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed a strudel in it, said he was so beautiful to eat the cassettes, so she tried to see if she was sleeping with a strudel.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, this incident is still on his dad's plate today, poor thing.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she stuffed the strudel in the video and thought she would play it with a recipe and not play it, so she still can't bake it.
I remember when we were all able to communicate with each other, to talk without a cellphone, a computer.
My sister and I, on holiday, arranged a neighbour's granddaughter meeting with my grandmother's granddaughter, when we would meet again next summer with my grandmothers - and that was the case, that's what it was.
We're gathered.
Promise now with someone you'll see you in a year's time?!
I also remember the winter, when I and I ran the whole village outside, built snowmen, rode a snow-covered hill by the church on bags stuffed with hobs.
Then the whole family and I had dinner and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard the notorious phrase before each dinner: "Being wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have the tap-car fastened soap in the lemons net.
After dinner, when my dad "worked" in the garage over a beer with Jarda from the village, my mother and I lay down on the floor, rested our legs against the tiled stove, opened the door and stared at the flame, and listened to the crackle of the wood that had been coming from the stone.
We were closer - really - not counting how many friends we had on the social networking site, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through various chalets, SMS messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at albums where they are neatly glued with black corners-induced black-and-white photos.
And in case I didn't know how old I was then, the picture is always written from behind the photo for a year.
I am looking to see that although the haircuts didn't suit us much by pot, and we wore our pants two sizes too big after our cousin, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better go back that step forward - to reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what the modern age will come up with for my children, for example.
What I do know for a fact is that these memories of mine are now at least "in the old-timer-behind the monkeys" for the younger teenage generation, and I think they miss a lot that they don't experience this "prescription" time either.
I'd like them to!
They must save, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea with what interest
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
Still, they do not reach the region's savings champions.
The most money is being made away by Austrians, who save an average of €181 a month.
A little more than Czechs, people in Slovakia are also saving.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of respondents plan to set aside more money.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of saving products.
For example, almost every other Serb saves "under a pillow" at home, according to the survey.
Domestically, this year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has risen.
As recently as last year, 26 percent of respondents spent CZK 1,000 and 2.5 thousand crowns each month for a variety of savings, up five percent this year.
The average monthly storage in the year-on-year comparison, however, fell slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is the supplementary pension.
This is favoured by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular method for appreciating savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents already use these, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they make on individual products.
Young people under 30 in particular do not know how their money is remunerated.
Conversely, the earliest awareness of the return on their money saved is best known to the group of respondents, with 73 per cent of respondents aware of this among people over the age of 50.
In the international comparison of the Erste group, Czechs lead online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Austrians with 12 per cent.
Australian woman appeals to stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-day prison in Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally 15. June accused by the provincial court on the island of Phuket of perjury when she told the Thai police that the taxi driver, along with two other men who were holding her, attacked her in the early hours of Sunday 10. June.
However, the footage from the industrial television later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after she had separated from her Australian friend.
Police from the island of Phuket conducted interviews with Bamford for two days before confessing to making up the story.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security low-security detention facility in the Phuket, instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney-based Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's a challenging time, but we hope he will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on a $50,000 baht bail.
Reports from Australia reported that in the meantime she was spending her holidays in the Krabi recreation area in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but is said to have been warned that the appeal may lead to court proceedings that will increase her sentence and result in placement in adult prisons.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agency employee Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to correct the bruised picture for tourists, which may have just been behind the acquittal verdict.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Lyricist Michal Horáček brought not only his brand new two CD Czech Calendar to the Cologne Municipal Social House, but especially in the programme Between Us by singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěj Benko.
After the initial intro and acting etude about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, came up with a candle in his hand, recalling the story of how they last played in Cologne and the theatre and the electric current fell out throughout the city.
"Otherwise, they were making two types of cards in Cologne that I came into contact with a lot of," he recalled.
He also reminded the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of the Zákolany or Dúbravka u Bratislava," he quipped about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horacek, who had not left the stage and, if he had not spoken, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also done by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but at the time he had no idea about how we meet in those squares and chanting who doesn't jump is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we won't play it here for you here today," he amused.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this record for him is said to have a very suitable Sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied himself to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers accompanied by a band consisting of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
The three vocalists together sang a little of the ripper Into the Slope of the heart sits, which immediately sparked the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded afterwards.
After the memory of Peter Hapka I heard I recognize in the form of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with huge applause, Hana Hegerová was reminded of the song Dad liked by Lída Baarová and with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and replacement of Baarová by the American actress Mae West.
Composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, Segrado then sang a gorgeous song Prague set by Jarda Svoboda, a subscribe to the roster and the former Kolíňák.
But it was the end, the standing ovation and the addition in the form of an optimistic piece We Live in a Beautiful Time.
There was another encore for the playlist, but the fans didn't kick in.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover from the legendary LP and took a photo with prospective buyers.
The CEO of CEZ recently announced that he was postponing the decision to build the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Policy and by agreeing the Contracts difference of the government.
With these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to delegate its responsibility to the government - that is, for the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should make recommendations to the shareholders, not hide behind it.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of parental leave
Billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over a parental leave programme because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from it.
The Mining magnate, who is in dispute over the $6 million coal tax credit for the payment of a $6 million coal tax, made the claim trying to take the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate to play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit the policy of the personal benefit.
"He's been in a major conflict of interest in terms of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters were to become pregnant, he would be directly interested in whether she would be given parental leave," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission, after recounting votes, officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the fight for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast area with 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polling stations have closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately, and get the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to label as ballots.
Is it that the results can be erased if someone doesn't like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied electronic voting opportunities and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his policy programme also applied to the airports in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
The Public Office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Six firms out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
The impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act, as of 1 January 2014, six out of ten firms have been intensively prepared.
Only eight percent of the company's surveyed representatives said they did not address the issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming date for the effectiveness of the two key codes, a number of directors are only now beginning to realise at the last minute what a significant effect on their companies' business can.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavishing of politicians, the business sector has long lived in the dark about whether revolutionary changes would eventually take place or not.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to make the switch to the new right for their companies without complications," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively dealing with the new codes, 26 percent said their firms had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 per cent of companies of this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, one in five companies has not yet addressed the recodifications, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight per cent of companies admit that the issues associated with the recodes have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code for the largest number of companies surveyed is the conclusion of new contracts (21 per cent), followed by a solution to the terms and conditions (16 per cent) and changes to the Land Registry and in liability (for 10 per cent).
Contracts will take place one of the most important novelties of the entire recodification, namely the unification of contract adjustments only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercialodes will lapse, with the result that the contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs alike.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new arrangements will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom to organize relationships," said Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal's Lukáš Poddaný.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies see the issue of increasing the liability of the statutory bodies as the most important issue.
This is followed by themes on changes in the convening and conduct of the general meeting (15 per cent) and representing the company (14 per cent).
The new legislation means tightening up the obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is at risk of bankruptcy or reaches.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the boards of directors and the managers of the companies do not act with the care of a proper treasurer and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit of the acquired for the performance of their duties for the last two years," Spáčil said.
NSA unveiling increases social paranoia of state surveillance
On a peaceful day towards the end of August, a German police helicopter was buzzing at the US consulate office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV Office hoped to be able to identify the presence of listening antennae, and the event launched an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence options "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in favor of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit."
But since Edward Snowden, who became an associate of an informant, began to expose his valuable collection from undercover surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen no longer know if to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was espionage in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, general paranoia about state-protectioning new dimensions has reached general paranoia about state surveillance.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was perhaps tapped for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then potential targets are certainly also leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden made intensive cooperation between the US intelligence services and the companies more transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, a company representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY consultancy service, German companies believe that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much of a risk as China.
But throughout the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no evidence that the United States was transferring the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policymakers have expressed concerns that the EU lacks some IT and internet capabilities and said it should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are sceptical about it.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make the German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies uncovered by Snowden is still shocking to some companies who have thought that China was the biggest threat to follow surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have become more aware of the broader realization that the data stored in the US is under the jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance business community, around 10 percent of non-American members, following the US Prism data mining program, cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the US.
Jim Snab, one of the CEOs of SAP, says, "Do we have a new customer issue that wasn't here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that the powerful states want to alienate their most precious secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"This is a major issue for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are doing espionage on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we do espionage on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Entreports leaders generally don't want to boast of the countermeasures they've made to potentially not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory drive or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise.
Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi's board member, says it has been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrecy against unauthorised approach," warns the BfV in its report.
The US is warning its own company about economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second row of perpetrators involved in the hacking activity for economic intelligence officers, in addition to Russia and Israel, as soon as China.
A board member in a German risk-free society concluded that, as far as economic espionage was concerned, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: "Services know quite well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, conduct espionage on their allies."
New nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human exams, you need to run more tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first hints are good.
"We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong to overcome all current approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to bear the genetic information for the creation of anti-inotine antibodies.
The virus selective in-forms the cells of the liver, which then begin to form a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from taking a nicotine hit.
Tests of vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the mice that weren't vaccinated, "squitted," the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be administered often enough to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they convert liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for people, they could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, and avoid addiction to nicotine addiction.
But it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't have any pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that'll help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but caution that further research is needed.
The desperate cry of Obama's voter
I voted for Obama twice – I shared hope for a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts were derailed by the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the woes of Obama's healthcare website or unmanned aircraft attacks
The memores of the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a year of med school at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought of this book that during the grim days of my second year at the medical school, I would be encouraged and renewed for me in a chore of hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and these are memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish the patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and your speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelmingly dominance, and the TV news was forcing us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept the paper they could get.
A young visionary team headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent of support.
And this is where I'm closing the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is hard to recall these optimistic days - seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Indeed, in the years after I threw in my first ballot, there were indeed changes.
It was certainly none of the most I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the Affordable Care Act to the Immediate Care to the Immediately to the Immediate and to the End of the "no question, to ask nothing, to say nothing" after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party's obstruction has reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the public's ability to choose health care and close the Guantánamo base.
But after many of the situations in which I defended the Obama administration from my colleagues and comrades, I have reached an absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
Republicans' obstruction cannot explain the approval of foreign leaders' eavesdropping or the drone raids that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by them that the National Security Agency is collecting data about the private lives of Americans, or of pursuing those who detect the government's mishandling.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper trial, or a curtailment of public contributions and expenses during the presidential campaigns.
It is impossible to justify the findings of the report, which says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration."
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after the Consignation of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if such a thing was to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The election position clearly does not have a predictable course, and our public talks will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to the extent to be the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a puzzled and unpubtened alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would live up to the hopes we had once heard of.
Yet a return to 2008 – with Obama's support to fall below 45% this week – is getting harder and harder through this book.
It makes me remember that series of promises that have faded.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the New Yorkonist primary.
At the next meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back up to speed and remain loyal to his mission.
"I want our charm back," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I agree with you.

Syria destroys its means for producing chemical weapons, says supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, the Global Chemicals Assistance Committee said on Thursday, while fierce conflicts have broken out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
a term set by this organization based in The Hague set for Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery for the blending of chemicals in order to create poison gas and fill ammunition.
Completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
This country is believed to have about 1 000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mustardment and nerve gas, sarin.
The announcement came as the fighting raged in the town of Safira on Thursday, which experts refer to as the headquarters of both the chemical weapons and storage plant, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, said the UK-based Human Rights Observatory.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of casualties through a network of activists in Syria, reported on Thursday that 120,966 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are to be 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are also expected to be 2,220 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25. On July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced the population of about 2 million to leave the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observatory said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures.
The fighting underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in their mission to rid Syria of a chemical arsenal in the middle of the ongoing civil war, must deal with close deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which is working closely with the UN, it was said that his team was now "a satisfied that it has verified - and monitored the destruction – of Syria's declared crucial production and transferee/fulfilment equipment."
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of the verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites had been "released and ... the items in the chemical weapons programme it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked, according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had," observers' director Ahmet Uzumc said in his commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with its security forces, are facing each other in the Alawit sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, in the civil war.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a severe explosion on Wednesday inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of the European continent's energy security.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risk of the conventional routes, say officials.
Miller says that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" removed.
As soon as the whole project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the construction is expected to start in other countries in the course of this year.
The pipeline is designed to be an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic centimetre of natural gas.
Early puberty: Advanced Early
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty before their white pehem.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It has not been shown that hormones or other chemicals are behind it
Experts say one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in the boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in the health of children and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start to grow at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paest of Children's Physicians this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I've spent a lot of time assuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair on ohanz and under the armpits and body odor, appear in girls earlier.
Over the last forty years, however, there has been little shift at the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, it is now average age of 12.5 years, compared to the age of 12.75, in 1970.
"When breast boobs start to evolve, it will be at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Fasse Brief Bomb on Girls: An Invicious Handbook to Cure to This Frequent Problem Problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is the time.
Discussions are what activates the actual start of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered to be "prematurely advanced."
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stopped – which can be closely monitored by paediatric doctors.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to avoid serious problems such as a tumor or a cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature bone ageing, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and stunduate in adulthood.
Recommendations on medication and hormone treatment are dependent on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "suppressing puberty can alleviate the behavioral problems of a girl and her feelings that she differs from her peers."
Understandable is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have a period of menstruation.
"They're worried he might become pregnant, or how he's going to handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, whose daughter began to be menstruated at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends's.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environment chemicals or a sexual message in the media are to blame.
Boys - like girls - reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9, who combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, the patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by all sorts of things from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already at a young age to develop hair in the face and on the crooning, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Children's Physicians' Association (AAP) added additional complexities to the subject.
Acne and pubic hair is common even for infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrician at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the baby sooner than you'd expect," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child is likely to respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even when it does so prematurely, the process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They face a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the Kalamún mountainous region.
According to the still-revealing reports, Israel in Wednesday's raids on Wednesday destroyed hezbollah rockets for two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the military.
Its agenda is also to fight Israel, which does not interfere with the Syrian conflict but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of the weaponry to Hezbollah's hands to Lebanon.
News of Wednesday's Israeli arms raids in Western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station says that two warehouses were hit in which the rockets were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, they were Russian-made missiles SA-8.
Israel declined to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria has been continuously trying to supply Hepisbal missiles, and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the Hezbollah armed section to handle missiles.
The SA-8s are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are mounted on the moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, it is easy to hide thanks to the mobility and small size.
They are equipped with radar, which is switched off after the missile is fired, making it difficult to target.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling alaws.
It is a well-kept area and Hezbollah has participated in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he is helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alaskans belong.
Now, reportedly, 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamún lies between Damascusk and the country's third largest city, Homs.
The battle, according to al-Arabiya's source, is in retaliation for the opposition's recent attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Brigade Abu Fava's Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight back to the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusajr went to Kalamún.
In it, he argues that Maliki has a large part in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly the work of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka is negotiating for the ČSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people and the grandmothers are talking to each other and are preparing a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats get squeezed in a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly well-played partners who put a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The GOP envoys will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or give a nod to the fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka first came across after four days of being on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to take over the political board and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party so far is only him, the other team members will only be allowed after a crucial meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the board and now to the citizens.
You're not supposed to lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek, said after the meeting of the Social Democrat's inner leadership.
He added that he did not cling to the post of first vice-president.
"I will communicate my decision on 10th November at the Central Committee," said Hasek.
ČSSD Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the deputy club, Jeroným Tejc, spoke similarly.
He pointed out, however, that he had been elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then said they would do everything they could to make the 50-member ČSSD club sounding with one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I respected the decisions of the party authorities."
So another lie on live television.
Or did he forget, in the call for Sobotka's resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team, that the August ÚVV, with 57 percent, decided that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, by convening the ÚVVV, made a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of the 192 members of this body as well as the media with a collection of various gossip and rumors, or to recall the real flaws of Sobotka's political career.
There will be powerfully laundry to wash, there will be hints of a dark alliance between the coal baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
They will be debated in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
The warning are the words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka's ally, Petr Kajnar: "I signed the Charta 77 so that the country should not be ruled by idiots."
Had the DOJ met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritual sacrifice of their functions.
Traitors sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently victorious head of the ČSSD will then end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals for fighting poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work promptly on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, which expires in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
Overnight, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that it was now time to "get over national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the general SDGs' sustainable development goals," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the MDG.
Babiš: Only the government with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political trade in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The president of ANO admitted this in an interview with Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, plan to be hatched by giant secret landfills
Winter sports fans are already cutting the meter by the start of the Sochi Olympic Games, while others are looking at their preparations with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, though not starting until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to deliver on the promise that the preparation and hosting of the Games will not in the least disturb the nature of nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, with the Canadian Games making the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold "zero waste" games a long time ago.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill of building materials in the village of Achishtyr, near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foams was found by environmentalists in August, which they immediately reported.
Russian authorities repaires and the landfill disappeared.
But only for a while.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football pitches.
It is not the only one, several of them have been created in the area of such places, the British newspaper The Times has described.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is working on the site, building a roughly 60-kilometre journey between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The business, which has already consumed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroad resided that the landfill had been set up by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achishtyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste is at risk of contaminating the local Mzymmt River, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the Soc water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental non-profit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history are one big tunnel, according to the opposition.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics cost $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
Aside from corrupt scandals, project delays, and worries about whether there would be enough snow in the end, there were also reports that human rights were not respected at the sports and infrastructure exhibitions.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut in protest that he hadn't been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers grapple with a new law during the Games, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are set to support Russian gay men at the Olympics.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airlines will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landings, regardless of changes in the US to relax the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies room to change their procedures, allowing passengers to read e-books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their e-books during take-off and landings.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment at critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that the passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from the crew.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about the extension of the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, was in favor of the change but announced that it would take the regulatory board's decision.
"We would welcome CASA's analysis of the permission to use electronic devices because we really think that it would improve customer experiences now that when we have (wireless on-air entertainment), it would improve the experience of customers," the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that soon," he said.
The FAA's regulations apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory field, which can be useful to our travellers, and we will certainly study the FAA's decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company to the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio cancellations of mobile phones, as well as revising manuals, training material, hand luggage programmes and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to turn off the device during the landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the storage area overhead during take-off and descent.
Nonsense in Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the Graves universe sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic for some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews view the picture positively.
Others, however, find certain inconsistencies.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films that I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity included, even if it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You can notice the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow doesn't come in weightlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station move on markedly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one frame.
Some viewers blame the film for the unrealistic effect and the whole behaviour of the fire in weightlessness.
The suits, they said, would not withstand such wounds either.
Heroes in Gravity often collide with various objects, and suits can withstand everything without too much trouble.
Criticism was not spared or the plot plot.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some of the debaters.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the technique.
People also argue on the forums about the "unreal" behaviour of the ropes.
This is said to be as if it were destined for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the City. Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen so far, but I can say unequivocally, I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And for such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to adhere to consistently reality.
"More than the discrepancy you mentioned, I was touched by the number of times as a space station with a degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese) is shown."
"Chinese, after all, will be at the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to break the laws of physics, and so the natural-leaning viewer appreciates the moment of momentum, in various cosmic collisions and precipitation, to be perfectly justified by the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin skin of the atmosphere and aurora, flicker on the polar regions.
Irregularities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
Additionally, for example, I found when reading the comments that the preferred direction of the circulation of various cosmic trash in orbit appears in reverse in some scenes than should actually be the one to be the one to be).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted by the creators to their needs, but I did not record any fundamental and blatant transgression against logic or natural laws in the film and compared to other films of a similar focus, you can see that the creators took care of the credibility of the events depicted.
It's worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Teofel is orbiting in an otherwise bowed orbit than the ISS.
The consequence is a highly different mutual speed and the rescue operation could therefore not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I didn't notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there was no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces the two players to let go at the moment they were no longer moving towards each other.
Bombardier's profit plummeted as a result of a drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any data on the air test for its new aircraft of the type CSeries, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft would adhere to an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the opening test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results failed to meet estimates, and shares on the Toronto stock market declined 8 percent.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded his rating on Thursday from a "higher return" to "persector performance" with the expectation that the stock exchange would experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"While we mostly expected smaller shipments of aircraft, the profit margin in the field of transport has been significantly disappointed by us," Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe that Bombardier will get new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market's scepticism to the programme to increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight their way into the lower market area, which now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was detected in March and the first flight was held in September after a delay of several months.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177 as potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight to verify the company's claims regarding low consumption and savings on the cost of this airliner.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and liabilities from 15 customers and operators.
Managing director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was launched for commercial use.
Leadership officials also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing as planned.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the ground-based exam and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did that.
This will happen throughout the flight schedule.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others shortly after.
Nevertheless, analysts are sceptical about the first customer being able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims to have evaluated its plan to launch the aircraft and will provide up-to-date information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - even though it is in line with Bombardier's internal plan - is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
From USD 172 million or 9 cents per share the previous year in the third quarter ending on 30 September, Bombardier' net profit fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted revenue per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft, compared to 57 aircraft the year before.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aerospace division accounted for 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which is unchanged on 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlooks, but the low order receipt and the overall state of the market disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said the return in the division rose by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion as of September 30, a marginal growth of 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares in Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's finance director, Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the company's closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10% drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Mick Jagger says he definitely didn't go out after the then 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" for Jagger's song.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he took to her.
She added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very kind to me."
In a Thursday statement, Jagger's (70) deputy said he categorically denied that he had ever made Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing with someone else."
Perry was one of the visiting singers (sepings) who appeared on the Rolling Stones' concert tour earlier this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted in first place this week.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is a frightening message and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said, deeming the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is rigorous and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government's hand" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively hands over "full control of the media" to the government, and Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have "hit a tough blow" and criticize the bill as "strict."
The bill's approval comes amid a series of measures to strengthen national security immediately after the Islamic gunman's attack at the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The authorities' anger was approached by the Kenyan media when it aired a security camera footage of the military's senters allegedly looting a luxury goods store on the scene of the attack.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a head of a media officer be called in for questioning, but the summons were later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million by Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of "assignment on the list" or be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to seize the assets of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "there is also one fine enough to dispose of most radio stations."
It is also stated that these measures may have a winding-up impact on what is called Kenya's "live blogosphere."
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," the Nation Mutuma Mathiu journalist wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and balancing in public life.
"Leaving it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and cast us back for hunting and harvesting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been theft of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of abolishing cuts imposed by the National Wage Agency and for restoring their hefty salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, making it one of the highest in the world.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble is bursting
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the proceeds of the financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who presented a 7% transfer fee in the 2012 budget for the buildings at a price of over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the transfer fee for the transfer of real estate in the housing stock in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in tax year 2012/13, exceeds the total total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the Northwest and the Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: ‘Given the increase in the transfer of real estate at the homes of high value and the presentation of the related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are little taxed, regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that "this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy properties in London, or that the existing owners are reluctant to sell."
Leading properties – the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in a rich strip ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, the increase of a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in the centre of London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but were overshadowed by the booming "domestic market" on which, according to a survey by real estate agents Savills, the North (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) was an increase in the gains.
