Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center calls such a deception a myth, saying that electoral fraud is less frequent in the US than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Indeed, Republican attorneys have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US in the last decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, individual states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the US.
And, in this vein, since 2009, most US governments have been promulgating new laws that make it difficult for the election process or to enroll in the electoral roller and election.
This phenomenon boomed after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were submitted restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and a proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the periods for elections in advance, invalidate the right to be enlisted on the voting list on the day of the election, and take away the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no US state required the submission of a pile of identity with a photo on voters.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indoor Act was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the advance of this promotion to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo ID cards.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens own, i.e. 21 million people of age to vote, no identity card with a photo issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, about five million new voters do not have such an ID card in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young, minority and low-income earners.
25% of African-American, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are known as voters for their impending on democratic candidates, are not entitled to use their photo ID card in several states, on display with their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs at the polls.
Until 2004, no state required a citizenship certificate for the elections.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws that provide for an obligation for voters to prove to be American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
Indeed, it should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.
In 2011, Republican Legislaturalists supported laws in eight states that abolish the minutes of the election.
In addition, they have restricted the right of people and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These limitations have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, campaigns to register voters helped to register around 10 million people.
But the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% drop in the enrollment of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in the other five states aimed at shortening the election-long period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
The Hispanic people were the same.
They were just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, were only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the passing of laws restricting voter registration was strongly opposed by democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their vetoes.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General has even intervened.
They were partly reduced by the damage.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card was accepted by only 16 of the 34 states.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it quite undeniably more difficult in 2012 to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics speak primarily of bias in the laws passed and see them as an obvious attempt to influence the 2012 election results in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College required to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detecting prostate cancer: undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test produced sometimes erroneous results that were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this increased the hesitancy of the men, who were already so reluctant to go for the examination.
Getting examined or not?
We asked for an opinion from two experts.
Studies conducted in the US showed high levels of contamination between the different groups tested, making it difficult to interpret these results and making valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, noted a different mortality rate between the patients who had undergone the examination and those who did not go to them.
This study also showed, after a 12-year gap, that those who do not go to the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
A more at risk for men of African-American origin are also a more vulnerable group.
The key is to take the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are listless.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus rather on active disease supervision in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated for leave, as their type of cancer is not aggressive and is not at risk of life.
We propose to them to conduct active surveillance and, in the event of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly and more, we are setting criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend undergoing the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and to determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement created a tool to be assessed for and against in connection with the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite the advances in the research, the best means of limiting the risks of disease seems to be the adoption of healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian cancer research company.
By contrast, it is estimated that around 10% of cancer disease causes heredity.
A percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For a Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers is falling.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says André Beaulieu, the spokesman.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer is halving.
Weight
Substantiality and obesity are, according to SCC, an additional risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout a lifetime," the report adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends reducing the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages for which the same is true.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet drawn unequivocal conclusions.
Studies for vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although one of them says the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study suggests an increase in it.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unequivocally proven.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his family concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"Subject to the examination does not mean you will have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a legitimate uproar last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle, the existence of which is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least of bad" explanations for the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
Among physicists, however, there is not yet a 100% certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the big physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm it, but all the data is still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it is the Higgs boson, as the risks of the mistake appear to be small, and look at what is really going on.
In this world, there is a completely indisputable law under which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule is impossible to circumvent - and don't try too hard to do so, or you will hurt yourself.
Although the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it, too: Pauli's exclusionary principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly states" creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physicist particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obey Pauli's principle.
And at the other end, bosons move, underneath anarchists who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they may well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (as absolutely marvelled, by the way), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles" that spread by the great forces of nature and with whom the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as they might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light," which is the "carrier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when an electric charge particle accelerates or changes its direction, it "calls" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the pebble thrown into the pond.
This "cancellation" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, the "bearers of force."
Staller field
It's also with the Higgs boson, except that it takes another field to "cancel" the Higgs field to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitement, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, as with the frozen surface of the pond, it is already rippling up only a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the CERN laboratory accelerator - a large hadron accelerator with accommodating volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
Analogy with an electromagnetic field is again useful to elucidate the relationship between Higgs and matter.
The electromagnetic field does not respond with all the particles or all the materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept on its own on the fridge.
And, anyway, with the Higgs field, all the particles do not respond: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's see it) do not have it.
And Mrs Novak asks, what is all this research for, what are they "give us" to do?
In terms of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), allowing physicists to examine any mismatch between observations and the predictions of SM.
Moreover, not a physicist literally wants to be found, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model has hitherto huge flaws, does not provide any clarification of gravity (the back!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of the space mass (again!).
However, the CERN has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Responses
The responses to this research in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs Novák are very difficult to predict, but the mistake would be to believe that there would be none.
Behold: in the very early 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would provoke.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I already said it - the laser was initially considered such a "heat to the lab."
Just imagine...
And, in addition, it can result in any instrument that surrounds research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his optics work.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan to do so at first, now serves as an "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and awarded it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to leave your life... | Le Devoir
Through his Commissioner for Disease, Quebec recently engaged in a delicate issue on the end of life.
The debate should continue shortly and, at the same time, a bill is planned.
In this crucial area, a lot of work remains to be done.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at the issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of my life and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois house in Beloeil, where he had come the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet or just eating himself.
He looks resignedly at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to the unknowns who stop by him, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage to a simple death.
"My best wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In life, you learn men toe standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the child's stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person to accept that return, the psychologist says.
In the view of a number of people dealing with palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter a Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide them with so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs.A., 89, the worst fear is to die "for the asphyxiation in full consciousness."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I have no wish in my life," he says, and then he consents to put her on a breathing apparatus.
Still, he is looking forward to his son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, it provides body care with the help of nutrition.
This is the palliative care that comes in, unless anything else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for 11,700 residents.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it's the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, they can be provided, for example, by a sip of brandy or pepsi, to the taste.
Diabetics no longer need to watch their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they were carrying a beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his drink in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as our loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, the director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, the days go one by one, but they are not like each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who rejoices in his last meeting with his family, thoroughly padded on cushions while toasting him in his honour, a tragically 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, a wife and two young children, dies tragically after trying out all the possibilities to survive.
"For six months, there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel tells us with concern.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. the care that is designed to alleviate suffering as soon as the sufferer reaches the final stage of their lives, whether it's at home, in a hospital or a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Treatments Society, are more or less specialised in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that leads to many of the palliative care-regentologists fearing the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, the manifesto has been circulating, signed by the leaders of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disapproval of such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure all people's access to high-quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to the execution of euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to make her feel better.
He is concerned that patients should not apply for death on the grounds that they are not receiving appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are caring for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavourable prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of surviving were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was quitting, she was telling us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the sick people who wish to die thank their treating doctors for not filling out their wishes when a team of palliative cakes eats avenging the pain.
But it has to be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Society for Palliative Care, patients resist treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives to put the patient to the patient until the moment of the demise, either on the impact or whether he is permanently sedated.
It is impossible to pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient we will not get rid of pain will have an increasing opportunity to access palliative sedatives.
The sick who are not provided with a sedative always say the same thing: 'I want to die'.
But this does not always necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means more of a "wanting to relieve me of the pain."
The implementation of this report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in Health.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public-sector entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and Italian mafia experts still tell us what they know about the amazing "system" that blends construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
This "field" cost the Quebec taxpayer very dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has been crippled since we took major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec's MP and former chief of police in Montreal, ironically.
It erupted in a scandal in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous inquiry into the embezzlement of funds in connection with the road construction contracts in Quebec that the then-liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after lengthy delays.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed the direct link between the industry, opaque party funding and the corruption of state officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transportation has only saved $1 billion in procurement," with some people keeping their instincts to gain a share of them!
The Charbonneau Commission "has brought two mayors to resign," he adds, hoping to "create the cunning of some people."
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
A permanent corruption unit, founded in 2011, is also involved in the fight with its military of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the "Marteau's retinue" police officers, who have ensured since 2009 that the Montreal "cashdown barge" would significantly soften the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and indicted for fraud and corruption, a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban community.
Another on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public procurement.
The formal accusations have also been made by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito drew a sensation by explaining to the commission the "system" mechanism of public procurement.
He himself devoted over these years to the 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal to a midfielder linked to the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambito was generous in all-party ways after 2000, and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegal fundraising for former liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts of money-making, the prices of which he exaggerated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very keen.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in great detail to the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts from the construction companies, the invitation for trips, the golf tournaments, the restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money-worths worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with the money he overstated the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had paid their bonuses for overstating by 30% to 40% of the invoices through false extras.
The mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye to the simultaneous budget that brought dirty money to his coffers without embarrassment.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, it has been advocating the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters right in the middle of a thriving real estate deal.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "she is pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the soreanal system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process, she said, was "painful but positive."
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so that these dubious practices cannot be reversed back.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "the public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly worried about the role of "members informed about this ruse" if they have not gotten into these shenanigans!
He estimates that 70% of the funding for election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and he adds with irony: "I have heard that this is just a weak brew of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit the parties' donations to $100, but he says that will not resolve the situation: "Until the electoral spending is strictly unlimited, the dirty money will not go away from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive review of the public procurement and party funding system: "We cannot fall back to the backstabbing; if we boldly focus on the nature of things, we can rebuild on a more solid foundation and with greater scrutiny and compliance with the law."
If this story has blacked out an image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends anyone who mocks it to see their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain these developments?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or the absolutely new dimension of PSG.
The big players came to us.
Every day I get on next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier in the games.
Things are going really fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
Ever since I started in the INF Clairefontaine prep school, to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved up by the stages.
So you are taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The reinforcements of this summer are accustomed to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give the maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of credit for my status.
He has assistants to his hand like Claude Makelele, who used to play in the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have the final say at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
He is not equal in League One today and is among the best European coaches.
He has vast experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with the excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring interview with him in January.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
In League One, Lyon took away our lead.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the last eight very easily.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first before Porto so we can play in the last-eight rematch at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget is up to it...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
It is not yet like this today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to implement this intention.
And would it be a big failure not to win the League One like last season?
Of course, that would be very disappointing.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed last season quite a bit.
We were disappointed in May because we had the money to win.
We had a great season.
We've picked up 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more apt season.
I think it will be done this year.
Even though the title is sought by major teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expect PSG too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat the Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something they blame us in the paper, that's not exactly pleasant.
You ask what more people want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up the game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, who didn't make it to the last eight for the second season, and they've also invested big sums!
Given the sum invested, you'd expect to be 15 points ahead of the others!
You insult the other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not perform well in last year's season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how awesome League One is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG are relying on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in everything.
It is good that they say there is a "dependence on Zlatan."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves to be the star of the League One.
Everywhere he went through, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team we respect both man and the players.
He, too, respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has also led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of my injury, I couldn't play the way I'd have imagined.
But I've been through it and I've come out of it stronger.
Today I am also doing well in the national team to play good matches.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I took over.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we owe it to ourselves to make our demeanement exemplary.
How do you feel about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the national team?
There are results for him.
We are in a good place qualifying for the World Championships.
The coach selects sternly, is close to the players and he can get excited to win.
So was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.
It is a draw (1:1) from 16. October in Spain with a solid starting match?
This game gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have never experienced such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All the negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs among beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonymous), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the file exchange between pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers plugged into the network, around 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin's exchange rate first reached a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropping to $2 five months later, hovering at about $10 today (the odds overview is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, this is not impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin calls it "the most successful virtual money," "the competing dollar and the euro" and "the same as common money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is, as "credits" used to advance in a video game that one obtains through the game or that one can buy (and sometimes replaced back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But every month, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are current account books, controllers, issuers of money and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses using an email.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-wrenching encryption system.
The net can thus verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
The contents of the file can further ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public book of current accounts that is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is through the process of resolving a mathematical task commissioned by the computers, whose solver, a temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a stage of dismantling the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
The computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "slash" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then displayed in an inescapably linked to a string of all other transactions; any modification would change the fingerprint.
If the user wanted to pay for fraud with the same money very quickly (within ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other one will be abandoned because each of them has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is shared regularly by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by 21 million, but can be divided into the 100 millionth, so the margin space is there...
The difficulty of the task specified is also increased as the calculation level increases.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
The website that provides services for Bitcoin was attacked and the stored bitcoins were stolen.
"The exploited loophole does not relate to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-funded company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the money laundering options thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Prominent players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a WordPress blog platform, receive them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and proved that nearly 80% of bitcoin are not circulated.
In November, "enough discounts" were launched.
"30,000 dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul's transformation of bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a teaching book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of the technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or mobile contactless payment, but it uses a Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make them cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for merchants, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give the address that can be "photographed and discerned" by phone, clarifies Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to questioning hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for bitcoin to assert itself, but 2013 could be crucial," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB envisages a rethink of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their responsibility for Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside who were punished the most harmed because we considered them terrorists.
And so do we, we've lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all the wounded and the maim.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even when they were joined by the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French units from the foundation of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains encrusted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was done in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacking with the aerial accompaniment of a helicopter.
As of the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be as active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable practice between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty then, and the earth was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various resistance groups.
Taking control of the ground was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscene of these peasants, which were completely dominated by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved by our time.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an attempt to preserve women in a subordinate position.
The chief dignitaries of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became hustlers, seized the state-owned land they sold as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited each other; most of them, moreover, had never been in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people are craving a government that will not be made up of thieves.
Many of the youngsters want to leave as those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity will leave: the capital flight is significant.
The young are tired of the war and its associated ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and their advantages were intrigued by it.
About 65% of the population is under 25; there are currently 5 million people in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full, with girls and boys.
These young people will need to be given jobs, they no longer want to return to the former parties' obscurantism or the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish shows show the modern world are watched everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take the lead in it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already being rebuilt by provincial militias, beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should look forward to some degree of decentralisation along the lines of Western nations, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state of strong presidential influence, so that the post of prime minister, which had already existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be essential.
Rumors have been booted that Afghanistan has a vast mineral richer.
And this only fueled the feeling that the Western states were only there to seize it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, however, there can be no extraction of minerals.
The Chinese had almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving the international archaeological teams (at the World Bank's support) to explore the sprawling Buddhist compound to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to resume normal relations.
The departure of the French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of the common types of aid: girls' and boys' lycee, the Department of French at the universities, the French Institute, the cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, the support of an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "get your heart and soul" initiative has worked, attempting to reconcile help and army activities, in which the "civil-army steps" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was cancelled in 2012, but achieved a number of achievements in the area of mutual interest and actions for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages, thanks to a small French NGO.
These works, involving a multitude of local workers, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the cultivable area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often at an altitude above 2 000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written petty agricultural aid requests from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, these farmers wish to, they say, they wish to obtain a little civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi embarked on another poker game.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants unlimited powers to it, it has decided to play the ball.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else's opinion, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the next term.
Less than a week ago, the head of state awarded this ralcany meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has been using a makeshift text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," continues to "violate his word" and "transfers the law."
But his supporters assure that this is a means of turning the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should take place in two weeks' time.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention to clarify the text to the Egyptians by article.
It is also a way for the president to re-accept national and democratic legitimacy, while the country is roiled by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organised vote puts the people before the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: 'Either you approve my text or I will leave unlimited powers', which should otherwise end after the new constitution is approved.
And in this particular atmosphere yesterday, the 85 members of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they slammed through the door, saying they had no way of getting their views known.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their move.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 alternate replacements were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators went on to pause that one of the few disputes revolved around the day... a prayer class when some committee members took the view that the hours in the conference room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was still to be put to the vote last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains the same as that of the 1971 constitution, and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, were hopeful to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules," which would allow for a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egypt's society.
"Hyrability," the Liberals object, seeing only a rhetorical problem.
In their view, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus, in particular, on Article 220, which entrust the University of al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular to the issues of the monitoring of the conformity of the laws with sharia law.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, this is unsettling because "persons called to comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen as the beginnings of the theocracy."
The concerns of the Liberals are further fuelled by the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamas, but university staff, many of whom have studied in French schools," says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a job on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions about the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is a reference in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, ed.].
And in the future, the question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment may be.
The text approved yesterday is highly criticized in addition to the religious sites because of the expanded powers that are granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in them compared to the former regime.
Another contentious place: the powers vested in the military.
In line with the wishes of the military's representatives, the defence budget will not be verified by parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, the military courts will not be banned from driving with civilians, as the human rights association has called for.
These associations speak of their doubts in the context of the text, which they say is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is preserved and the insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture laid down in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to address a televised address last night, rallies are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then rally on Saturday.
In Israel, the holy places, the world's navel and the sea of saturated salt solution await Ukrainian tourists
The land promised together combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comforts, and the touching nature of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Complime with holy places
To visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is argued that all who enter this "human" will descend upon God's mercy.
And the Galilee - instead of Jesus' miracles: the transformation of the water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, the soothing of the storm and the filling of the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass through the Path of Path, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonio - Pretoria - where the court was held, walks through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of God's Grave on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, the stone of the rites and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to the Christian legend, the tree grew from which they made a cross to Jesus' crucifixion.
There is also the most sacred place for Jews in Jerusalem - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notebooks with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Do a Vertical Road
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are found on reefs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
It can only be reached by its own forces by those involved in climbing.
Others will be taken to this historic mountain by a cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, the well-known Hermon ski resort is located, experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, a shuttle bus takes tourists from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to the ancient legend, the pagan gods were supposedly on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
During one trip you can't visit all of them.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are certainly worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the ancient Kumrán manuscripts, or the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were found in the cave of the Judea Desert, and approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
His exhibit is widely represented by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha-clouding museum, which present to visitors several rooms of the ancient Turkish spa with mannequins of spa users and spa keepers from that time.
In Caesarei, the unique private museum of Ralli is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter - and find yourself in total darkness.
The stars glitters.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished are born.
Ukraine is also listed.
Improve your health
Israel's three main spa resorts are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coast.
Each offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
Interestingly, you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, as the water temperature in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it, people bathe all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the planet's lowest landmark - at 417 m below sea level.
The water in it is saturated with a saline solution that is easily kept afloat even by people who can't swim.
The surrounding countryside is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and a healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, echims, arthritis, bloodthirsty, bronchitis, diabetes inflammation, diabetes, to heal your scuffed nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Across them were the famous naval route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they then lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists truly love wandering through narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you press your face to the walls in the aisle of "his" sign, your luck will be favorably inclined.
In Jaffa, you may meet the newlyweds coming here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarei - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the cruiser fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of the Roman Prosecutors, including Pontski's Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word with you
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian in this country.
For the journey, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now the dollar is approximately 3.8 shekels).
The city's transport is mainly buses, but there is a speed tram in Jerusalem, and in the city of Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city with the upper town.
It's basically an underground rope track.
Travelling by all the city's public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel 1.5 hours with the change.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, work stops in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will only get kosher meals: with the exception of pork, seafood, no-scan fish and meals that feature a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus porridge, various sauces, minced chickpeas marble - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are very many fattened cats who are graciously "turning to their taste."
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The purring cats love the crowded places and embrace to go into every treat.
Renting a car will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, a Volvo S80) per day, according to the car.
Plus insurance - $1 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost around 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expelled by the numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The country and rest were visited by the most citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised land was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver 9. February 2011.
"Big and Powerful" to Moscow announce it: emigrants save their language money
While MPs and human rights activists are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "fallen" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities, 13 million foreign workers come to attend each year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their sole purpose is to make enough money to support their families at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force, under which every working migrant will be required to pass the examination of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that, over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of the law.
The knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed for obtaining and extending the work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to people who have successfully obtained an attestation and obtain an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Utility, convictions and the protection of rights
The network of test sites will be working under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between the Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. St.P. Castuard and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by the members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, the human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: what would it really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
For starters - the migration service's representatives responds - this will make it possible to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of 'slave's work'.
Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains FMS Russian Chairman of the Board of Directors in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only the system of organised recruitment will make it possible to solve the problems of foreign workers by 90% of the problems.
Problems arise for emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping, will provide him with a "pouch" in the monstrous, tight-firing hostels in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will languish for months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one in their homeland, but they will be cheated on arrival, they will confiscate their passports, they do not pay their promised wages," confirms the head of the Main Tajikistan Railway Migration Administration of MS Tola Sharipov.
Don't swear!
All less so because many of the Central Asian Republic's citizens who intend to go to work in Russia acknowledge that they are not only ignorant of the language of the country they want to get into, but they do not even have the experience of the work.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as it is unhappiness: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed the children with something, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, put on, and equip them to school.
As children grow up to working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the Language Tests Act, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who are legally in position.
If they don't have it, they won't take the exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally as they used to.
"Welcome, or Invited Forgotten Not Forbidding"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization, moreover, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Staff at the Russian police know that we have basically false documents, without registration, and from that the aftermath of the blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Kushkhatamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared with the press about his experience.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that false ones were not only the migrant's registration documents.
FMS staff have already confiscated several false language examal certificates.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a plain colour printer.
Of course, they did not reach the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of making the test problem so easy, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times the amount more than passing the official test: it's going to cost the migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy the documents, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests the first time they needed to take a course in the foundations of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active negotiations with people are not required.
MVD (Interior Ministry) does not circulate illegal market for weapons
The proportion of offences using legally held weapons is very low
Russia's MVD is tabling a proposal to tighten the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is a response from the government's authorities to recent events: the impetus was instigated the case of the shooting of the wedding, which passed without casualties, and the massacre prepared by Moscow attorney Dimitri Vinogradov, which killed seven people as a result.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age from which to obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the House of Security and Fight against Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovay, who promised that changes to the Weapons Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the "cutting of the screws" path.
An open letter has appeared in the network, with the authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanding a rejection of the "intenseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist in an interview with the Russian newsroom of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed in the six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the tightening of civil weapons legislation will not prompt the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
In their words, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low cost.
At the moment, the Ministry of the Interior says the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" market for weapons is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who has worked for ten years at the Department of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot pages that take up gun orders
The first - "army or military journey," that is, the weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The soldiers were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baraněc says.
Another type of "black weapons" are guns stolen from security forces officials.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses as well as a weapon stolen directly from law enforcement staff.
The illegal "mainly" is being put up for sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proven that some of the fires were started intentionally - in order to cover the shortfall," says the former soldier.
In the words of Barance, both the contribution is being made by the weapons manufacturers.
"At present, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive on the international market and are decommissioning the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes the weapons are made in small-scale production, and the mafia was created to organize their fluid production," the former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of individual sources of shipments of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Investigation of Problems and Propositions Design.
Specialists have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminological literature and the data of public data portals focused on the topic of arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers report, come from the military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons have been on the black market "the fault of the official officials whose work is linked to the weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology."
The dealer-consultant at one of the gun shops who asked us not to give his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by the black "archeologists" are no longer purchased - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, vendors go for new shipments directly to the military warehouses.
Through the Ensign, the buyer buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order the gun at his place and he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he tells me.
"The truth is that the police are well in the loop, and therefore whenever a plan burns to them in the clarification of the offences, they will carry out a control purchase from the illegally arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer are most likely to find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy appeared who offered me the chance to switch to the "Tattering" platform, where there would be a man to lead me to the "out of the outbook" where we would negotiate.
I learned the award there only there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, the salesman tells us - a consultant. - I have such an acquaintance, but I do not fully trust him.
There are market sellers, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to tell me that my daughter's tooth had fallen out."
And now I'm going to get there through the man I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
A former soldier, Viktor Baraněc, tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was processing a paperwork to publish the subject.
The schemes, he said, had not changed.
They gave him an album with photographs of "all you thought about" was.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, is not offered a hare in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller to the woods and build a target for that.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I find out that the weapon is firing well, we are starting to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Stowtop on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to the website and groups to the "Compact" online, where you can buy a "for different purposes" a weapon.
This requires no documents or face-to-face meetings.
"You only have to have a set amount of money," the ad title on the website says, "Buy a fighting pistol or a vending machine."
On this website, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And the sale to the minors?
"Of course no license," the user asks "Ivan" (the version is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulating the "Fedorenkov" request.
The Federal Security Service has recently thrown a huge network of dummy websites on the dummy, and can be shovelled by those who wish to buy a military weapon.
People flock like hungry fish for bait and then take coal in Siberia.
Military Rapporteur and Mining MVV Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of such schemes: the website is usually registered beyond the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment via the ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says the press spokesperson for the NGO "Law on the Gun" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing the order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has recently thrown a huge network of dummy websites on the dummy, and can be shovelled by those who wish to buy a military weapon.
"People flock like hungry fish for bait and then conquer coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When you buy an illegal firearm, you estimate that you will pay the amount usually from $100 to $900.
In the words of Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Law for the Gun," you will acquire the Makarov pistol for between $100 and $300.
You must wait a month to a month and a half months.
The weapon is shipped from warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official Bureau of Statistics, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by a total of 7%, and was 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cleared cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food workers and supermarkets strike
Work at the "McDonald" ticket office passes through up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In America, a wave of protests has been raised in America against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and in the restaurants of popular fast-food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn to the wave of the ninth or whether it is destined to be extinguished soon.
This share is supported by unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the humble salaries received by the rank-and-file staff at the Walmart and the fast-food systems, the protest organizers aim to create them in their trade unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday," when an orgy of cheap sales struck America, engulfed millions of residents and, in some cases, accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, in which there are 2.2 million people working worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with unions and left-wing activists of multinational retail chain companies whose goods are for the people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage workers at Walmart stores only buy at work.
The availability and range of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods so cheaply because they pay little of their employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand-held scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a pay rise, complaining that the cost of the health insurance costs provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker receives $9.5 an hour, but that does not match the cost, the staff say.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the shoulders of consumers, any visit to the store will only cost 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
The defense attorneys at Walmart point out that the protest was held in only nine countries and should cause virtually no damage to the company.
"Black Friday" at the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
Overall, its coffers made nearly 100 million transactions on "Friday."
In an interview with the Huffington Post's left-leaning website, a representative, said that the jobs had been abandoned by a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all but one "further media sensation" orchestrated by the unions.
"An uncommitted cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their destination was not Walmart department stores (those in the progressive city are not very popular, and that is why they are hardly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick leave and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal and New York regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average, their rank-and-file staff in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The "McDonald" job passes through nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time behind the desk after school and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At the moment, I am constantly meeting in an interview with the "McDonald" workers who complain that they must live on this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a commentary, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast-food outlets start receiving at least $15 per hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be set up in the fast food spheres.
US law prohibits the administration from hindering the establishment of trade unions and punish activists of the trade union movement by bullying and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
However, launching a fast-food outlet for the trade union is also complicated for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons for this is the extremely high turnover of employees.
Disconneuous
There were noisy protests on the day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the event was a rally at "McDonald's" near Times Square at noon, where several local Democratic politicians, notably city council member Jumaane Williams, spoke, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't even pay you sicken and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the city's mayor's candidate, Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must speak together in support of fast-food workers to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity as any New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food community.
But only a few hundred people attended, though by no means all of them were fast-food staff, employing tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark to ignite the flame of the mass movement is as yet unclear.
"So far, the brain is deceiving average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology, the theme of augmented reality is a popular theme; lately, this means perceiving the world especially through the prisms of special glasses.
At its early summer, Google demonstrated a working model for the news at its annual conference, and it was announced in November that Microsoft had also filed for the patent application.
An interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Institute of Microsoft Sharamem Izadim shows that for the company's scientists, the glasses are a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us, in the frame, what is your research group doing?
- We are dealing with human-engaging machine interactions, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity, meanwhile, is stuck in the stage of working with the pixels on the flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with its finger.
We want to look for 5-10 years to advance and anticipate significant changes to this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect pickup - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is now for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone, the possibility of steering with gestures is very interesting.
- What else is ahead of us in the future?
- Regardless, the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow not so far particularly.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to identify not only the users, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And in the first place - to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings of our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sweeping, just such sketchy, short.
The gests would not be taken with the camera of the device, but with a bracelet that would track the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's large so far, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
How's that?
- How, for example, will you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at any given moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or anything else today?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can bounce back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1,000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's like maths and depth.
At the current point of view, all the current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we need to keep in mind not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also Z.
So the speed, the frame per second, is also very important.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delays of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent of this affects a person's interaction with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be of a very useful job at work, I just don't need so much touch, but I need some extra pictures per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a reflected-off signal receiver.
And the third camera - that's actually a standard visable band sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue system, play with the curvature of the camera placement and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present its glasses publicly.
You don't think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking while constantly holding a smatphone in the raised hands isn't very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful option would be the "transient" form of the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch at any time from glasses to a smartphone based on the cloud platform, a projection screen and further around.
Glasses - that's a very personal device, that's their strength (only you see the private stuff), and at the same time, weakness - augmented reality based on the glasses won't let you work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine, for a moment, that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man" but also to the common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out:there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say augmented reality - the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of background for imaging.
It records excellently in the compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibility to these "visit in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic beams at the defined point where the finger is located, evokes a tactile sensation, but it is still very faint - as if you were blowing on the bellies of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to deceive your brain?
To think he felt what he seemed to feel when he saw something at the moment?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here is yet another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a man physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all in the clubs), the moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a target, then work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in the sheer beginnings.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "St. Petersburg avant-garde" project, dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and the arts.
At the top of the list were already the highlights of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without achieving all-interrestal renown.
The new hero of "Rosbaltu" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, the one in the fashion pubs and the openers.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are on, always attract crowds of the audience.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical Stetrograd storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is the striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets is a smile on the face of the citizens, he brings everyone's mood.
He recently picked up a flask and became a St. Petersburg organ grinder because he matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city all over in red and not in yellow or, for example, turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with the look and image.
In this world, the red colour represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
While, in general, everything that is only a little different from gray gives rise to aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at having a conversation established.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to discuss.
-And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsk, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my journey was.
A wave of old free unofficial artists passed over then, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the new-wave artists, the post-Gazonvites, who brought us to "Pushkin 10," and there were no other waves.
It entices me to the theatre, to dress, to the music, to all genres except for the word.
- And all of this merged into your art-clinic ...- It was important for me to be at the center of St Petersburg's culture, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a place on Pushkinská 10, and there before the reconstruction there was a music-artistic club, a bohemian club, a home from the Petraburg bohemian bohemians.
Much was born there:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how they brought Shnaro with the "Ucho Van Gogh" project.
Šnur and his friends sang light songs under plywood, dressed in fitting leotards, in the middle of them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.
When the band started playing live, they became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg has led many programmes of the Hali-Galli times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training he got from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the aftertaste of the Art Clinic.
This is where our working and permanent guests left.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, the survey was held in the press, the special prize being "People in Our City."
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named, which ended my peak.
In new times according to the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characterised in a recognisable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which the topicality and insignia are captured live.
I'll have a programmine exhibition, "Russian Museum in the Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, now being so is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns, everything is wiped out, the tragic is taken.
I love the cartoon, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order of the locking order.
Today, people meet by their clothes, they focus on the external mechanics, not the inner person.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We saw you the same day as the city's organ grind. - The Cultural City should have such a hero.
And who should be him if I not?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people would gather in clusters, to love one, simple other people.
Today everything broke up on the micro-companies, today it is very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
You need to think today who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And there are several thousand spectators in Stas Mikhailov!
- He will be found with female fans, where the sexually social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural grounds and 10,000 of them don't come, and the result is less management, money, everything is wasting.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will fool them and break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung from a collector on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse terms.
They say:Culture of the clergy, the consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money to draw pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is scarce in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper Tsars, it wasn't in everything, the tsars, perhaps, didn't understand much culture, but they understood the need to support real experts.
Moscow is now good consultants.
In our St. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are tucked away in a corner somewhere, because there are need for great experts to properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right track.
Today, taste is thriving.
The same as Erarta, but it differs in that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburk is?
- Petěrburg - this is not the capital of culture, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is the right soil.
And on our angle, the arts are fading poorly.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers in our country today than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are inquisitive, who like to go to shows, concerts.
With us, such a layer is just a weak one.
We need art to become a fashionable affair, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented for the funds of the St. Petěrurku grant
Birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or colliding with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of the spacecraft with the Earthlings on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep its gender in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute, P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while the conditions for life are better on Mars, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
It is only possible to live there at a great height ornament of Venus... in space.
The questions of reproduction in the universe began with faukeeping scientists.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their Earth's relatives.
It was then carried out by the insects to orbit - the very small fruit flies of Drosophil.
In 1979, a quail's egg was sent into space to check how the embryo in weightlessness evolves.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the climb.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with this bird having to find support, to stand on its own two feet and start to move," says RAN's head of the Institute of Biomedical Problems Institute (IBMP) at RAN.
If they don't find support, the birds fall erratically and do somersaults.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds had the utter demise of instincts.
The birds did not respond to the light or the sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"We let the birds hatch twice, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, commenting on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with the animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But in the bio-satellite "Bion," there will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats who were already gravoid broadcasting into space.
They basically didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on the biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such attempts are to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the cosmic rats were born offspring.
However, approaching the problem of reproduction directly in the universe has yet to be approached.
It's a tough task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instinct when the normal environment is lost.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens reigns with abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was to Tereshkov.
The most expensive thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether they would endure a space flight.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"Anyften no one has answered this question," says Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the rocket-row-space industry.
In June of 1964, more than a year after a flight into space, the first female-cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second female-cock-corcer, Svetlana Savicka, who visited the orbit twice, was born and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who were born after long years and grow healthy offspring.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in the orbital flights," says the cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions with zero appeal, the cosmonauts are learning the habits needed to work in the open space.
The water mimics weightlessness.
For adults, however, the water is even a comfortable but, in its own way, a strange environment, it is a natural element for young children.
The little ichtiandi seem to confirm that life on the ground comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is in the mother's amniotic's amniotic in the on average 9 months and that it makes it easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bury, only 2 weeks pass.
"That's very little for a child to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, the Newborn Swimmer's instructor.
In short - if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn baby, then for women women the most natural inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is an attractive force.
Weightlessness is in weightlessness very quickly occurs to the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, the body's ability to expel the fetus.
We can leave that aside if muscle activation stimulators work in childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What's next?" Valery Poljakov asks the intrigue questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism does not have the gravity of the Earth, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or the system of muscles.
Newborns in orbit are not possible to dress up as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He would simply be deprived of what he needed to develop him unconditionally.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in an alien environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be totally unsuited to the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP bioethics committee.
So the birth of children in the universe is now just a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when it will become a reality, and when Earthlings will embark in their ships on a far-off planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
SAO chief: Sheikh-systagé inspection failed through politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and high-quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but it lags behind in its application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be the right thing to do - that's what I think is missing from us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also indicated by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of incorrect practice, he cites Petr Nečas's approach to the so-called "charticcze."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother businessmen with his checks - so is he banned or allowed?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it does, if it does, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is obliged to go to check and enforce obligations," Kala says.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German parties, comparing the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was going on?
This is a parallel check, which we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the point is that European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement, followed by individual national legislation and then by the practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and although the control is not yet terminated, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "stillar and more perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in some parameters.
So it is confirmed that it is not enough to create more accurate rules over and over again, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually help you do, what does it mean to you?
It is such joint control that could contribute to stopping efforts to refine the laws, lowering and improving the limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the appropriate thing as a reasonable thing (which does not always mean the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by lowering the contract limit, we do not necessarily achieve this.
Maybe the system will be overwhelmed with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in that system will draw on it a lot more easily than if the limit stayed higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transfer of legislation to practice public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is the office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO operates there the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in a similar way to us, also has a college, only forms in a slightly different way, but in principle the two authorities act similarly.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but in the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these accounting courts at the level of the various federal states - in this, the system differs from ours a bit.
The BRH can only control the federal money, in our country, by state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the county and municipalities, are checked there from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As far as legislation there is, that is easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, however in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better at everything.
So is it necessary that they have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that kind of comparisons.
But it has to be said that even the countries we see as a role model face a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any conducive to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are there any effect on its effects?
Since the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in the inspection events in our country.
Because we are doing ex-post checks, we need to expect some delays.
We are only seeing this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new "detention of risk integration" tool, through which we have laced almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there, of course, the changes will be reflected, as the limits will change, the conditions of some types of selection procedure will be adjusted and the like.
So you consider the approval of this law to be more of a benefit or a further burden on the red tape system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
A problem that may arise here that the rules will be "stretched" and it will not be possible to abide by them.
Already under the functioning of the previous rules, the audited persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act entails a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it therefore worth making the law tightening up in this way?
Not in this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to challenge and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
Then how do we get out of it?
Let's show where the road doesn't go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs by inspecting the so-called 'spirit system' - and what does that mean?
Švarcsystém is forbidden or allowed?
The law must be set up somehow, and if it does forbid something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of the office, which is obliged to go to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "Let's change the law and we'll pass it up," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
The Public Procurement Act has fairly strict rules on how to be formally implemented - which is correct to protect the public tender.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best bid is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be right - that's what I think is missing from us.
Roads are frosted in places, but mostly passable
In several parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frosted and also snowy.
But most of the time, the roads are passable, with caution somewhere.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region this morning the roads were passable, but in places frosted and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm up slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimetres of snow.
There was also lower visibility due to fog, according to data from the Regional Road Corps Dispatch.
The R6 speedway and the first-class roads are now open to the region without restrictions.
Caution is, however, in order, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosted and slippery.
It is also possible to travel all second and third class roads, including mountain roads.
On them, however, in some sections still lie the remnants of frozen and partly driven snow.
Especially at higher elevations, the ride should be paid extra attention.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are at risk of icing, at higher elevations and mountains, a travelled layer of snow may be on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate reports on its website.
Road crews warn drivers of icing, it can form especially at the higher elevations of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysoké Mýto, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The travelled snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today, it is most often clear to partly cloudy with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a light wind.
Plzeňský kraj
Roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but in places with increased caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is chilling in the morning, with temperatures ranging between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snow and subsequent cooling, some roads can be frosted.
Drivers must also expect fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is clear from the information provided by the Regional Road Corps Dispatch.
The D5 motorway is almost free of limits, but extra caution is advised by the communication manager between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, however, there may be frostbite sections.
Second and third-class communications are damp, and in this case, the frosted section warnings apply.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
The snow mash on the road must be counted today by drivers heading to the highest levels of the Olomouc Region.
After the chemical sprinkle, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
Road workers were driven into the field by snowfall at night, and about three centimetres snowed on Šumpersk, according to the travel managers.
In other parts of the county, the roadways are usually passable without restrictions.
"On Šumpersk, the remnants of snow lie in the highest positions.
Drivers have to count with the snow porridge on the Red Mountain saddle in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Šumperk Road Administration told the Czech Press Agency today.
Their colleagues set out into the field at night at the time in Jesenicko, the roads up to and the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomouck, roads are passable without restrictions, but on Šternbersko drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the roads have remained damp.
Ústí nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult-to-run sites are reported today in the morning by road workers in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with fallen snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústí nad Labem is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are also held at lower altitudes below zero, so ice and snow will probably last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
Operational complications are not yet reported.
The occurrence of the ice is reported by road crews mainly from the surroundings of Szczecin.
According to meteorologists, conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and melting snow, clear and frost at night.
From the main routes, unfavourable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border between the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees, which bent to the pavement to the pavement.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think of the end of the world coming to the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarms that we humans like to catch on.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make more fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world who can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will have a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to the readers more closely?
This is a nationwide fundraiser that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to tap the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., there will be 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar is about the end of the time-space on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which we will one day pass this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original germs against the end of the world, which are purchased at www.e-tap.cz, people can also support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anti-end anthem called "The End of the World Cancelled."
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, that is, if we all succeeds and the end of the world does not come to an end...
It is sung by all performers at all three concerts in parallel.
The hymns will suddenly also be linked in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words for this song were written and the lead role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, it is also sung by Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of fundraising events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and entertaining to work with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world go for?
The equipment of the Studeo barrier-free education centre, which we have been implementing with the civic association Tap in the Jedlička Institute for the sixth year.
School students at the Jedlička Institute regularly receive lecturers and attend to them in activities they enjoy and interest.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere will perform with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bangoo and Jiří Suchý.
Read all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so here too we will certainly prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play at the Czech Nationals in New York next year, and I personally, while we are in the US, I would like to link it to performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have so far performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it first appears.
We have five members on an electric cart, their carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we are lugging with us a large amount of cargo and boxes of tools...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, with CSA and British Airways being well prepared for us that I have often wondered.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Exports abroad make you compare how different different ones are in barrier-free, public access to the handicapped and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have just seen in Russia that in the east everything is still in the very beginning.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person to move on an electric cart in the city centre.
It doesn't even apply to such obviousness, such as to give a wheelchair user first in an elevator.
Fortunately, civic associations are already being formed there, trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the other hand, do we still have to catch up with more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we're still behind in...
But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy handicap to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, to wherever...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this we are a little bit ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or barrier-free is one thing, but it is only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things start to change in earnest.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years later, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined as a tutor at the Jedlička Institute, where I had many young people around who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, I started a special-interest music club with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our presenter Láďa Angelovič says, it has gotten a little out of hand (laughter).
But the popularity came in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with the well-known singers and also to actively work to promote the band.
We realized that a job that is not visible to us is basically like it didn't exist.
In addition, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality tutors, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something differently.
Showbusiness is crowded with things where one imitates the other.
It's logical in a way, it's all new to be accepted cautiously, and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I daresay Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But the regret is completely in vain, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we must be sorry for.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that when people with a handicap get something done, it's not just a shift for them, it's for the whole company.
Did this success also help that you are a strict boss, as many people have called you?
When we want to do quality jobs, we have to be uncompromising about many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic image and a head in the clouds, and when they find out they have to go to the exam for a twice-week exam, come to the product and spend a lot of time on the road to the concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The band Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and the taste always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected to the telemosti at the end of the evening in the joint singing of the band's song The Tap Tap "The Easter Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds to equip the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the volume of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 have free entry in the pre-sale of the Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was adopted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on November 12, 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of of agency projects over the following years.
However, Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
The flight to the cosmos was attended to by Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will mention, for example, a lecture by A. Šternfeld in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933, presented the ideas of its pioneering work Entry of Space.
The ideas of a young engineer (b. 1905) left the listener cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch awards for the Going to Space Astronautics in France.
The recalled Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of spaceflight, and his contribution was also praised by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925 a railroad was built in Poland to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to start the trolley or to brake it.
The information about this drones is only known from the period press.
From 1933, with missile missiles, Polish artillery began to dwell on.
The research was provided by Komórka Technicii Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of the age-old exams.
However, the arrival of German troops was interrupted by the research.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the work of Rakieta - the torpedo powietrzna and the rakietobomba of the lottery by the author Leliwy-Krzywoblock.
Both projects were intended for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all military-use projects of missile technology were dedicated to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ceased to commencement of the war.
Other work devoted to cosmonautics appears in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautycz).
The company is first mentioned in the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronauts.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, the creation of a company is designed to deal with spaceflight.
By then, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space exploration was a forward-looking field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has tried to join the International Astautical Federation (founded 1951) and became a full member in the fall.
And in the following year, the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful Meteorological rocket RM (Racieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957, with the first start of 10. October 1958.
The missile with a range of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was later built, and in the summer of 1959, the Bledov Desert flight tests of the two-storey RM-2 missile were launched.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type was supposed to be capable of real scientific work by now - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to track the altitude wind.
However, in 1962 further developments were suspended.
The first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, total length of 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked by Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket included a 0.4-litre space, a 0.34-litre Meteor-1B, and a 0.62-litre Meteor-1C.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Auschwaiti Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland also became involved in space exploration of the space on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmaut after Vladimir Remko.
The repeal of the Public Work Act is not the solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the various economic departments, the national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movements of private capital, along with the unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labour, (wages) there is a price voltage.
This is to be understood as a situation in which the producer tries to compete by importing cheap goods by "subverting" the price of a competitor in order to derue a greater market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a massive scale, this means either transferring production abroad to most entrepreneurs or to buy or disappear cheaply.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
As private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for its implied unemployment, social spending is necessarily rising.
The whole situation is heightened by the total unwillingness of the entrepreneurs' masters to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social society-wide damage he has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Reckless practices of private equity create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into a mutual competition to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are putting private capital at the risk of their own population, regardless of the social downturn.
This is particularly reflected in changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force their own population to adopt a private capital price dictate, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done both by the economic coercion system in the event of long-term unemployment and by restricting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
There have been public food outlets for a number of years in Germany for free to make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are quite common cases of duly employed people receiving such a wage that the state must pay them to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of the auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures by virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people, under the pressure of a disastrous social fall, are forced to either emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to languish for hunger wages on the margins of society in hopes that private investment capital might one day come to the country.
But here it is necessary to ask where he will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, or a Turk, a Moroccan, or an Egyptian, or an African, still work for a fraction of Europe's wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media to the frostbite argue that the state cannot participate in capital in its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital, with a sharp insistence, insists on the view that the state must not interfere with the economy by conducting interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether it affects private capital, now it actually governs the policy and thus the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
Here is the unequivocal answer that it is.
The proof is in the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, by legislating, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that state ministries for lack of funds award drafting bills to private law firms, which are often in touch with the industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All of them don't come from the people like Western-style constitutions say, but from financially strong groups who prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-leaning democracies are now rapidly in the situation, as described by Appiános in its work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey:" The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities have been enrising themselves by force.
For bribes, illegal acquiring of favor and using stones or swords.
The bribery and the corruption were rampaging without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice" ..."characteristic people didn't apply for the office at all, so that once, as a result of this disruption, the state was without consulars for eight months." .."It is a real beginning to talk about the fact that the only remedy in the evil situation is self-government and that you must elect an energetic man.." Appiános thought of Pompeius, but it was Caesar, who changed to a permanent democracy of self-rule.
Conclusion As in the antiquity, the current society is based on the unscrupulous preference for self-yet, regardless of the society's interest.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and claim the society-wide benefit.
The result is now, as it was then, the unprecedented decadence of the elites without any effort to reform a deeper nature.
The caucus of the emergence of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of the 19th and 20th century economic systems.
As things stand, the demise of these systems for liberal-type democracy can be seen as a kind of break with the expectation of the next round.
What is particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of years of loss of life, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with the crimes against humanity as we know them from both old and new histories.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not to a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and domestic European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further reduce the social population's level.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"There will be no and no can threaten violence" Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no war to die' there'd be a dying Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have arisen.
One stands behind Israel, argues its right to self-defense, and cast the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is cast as the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodic repetitive waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's people of Israel, including the local territories, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who, above all, has served the 95-year-long tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my reflections are supported by the available historical facts some are derived from them based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
Humanity's history is, first and foremost, a struggle for power.
In every epoch we can track down one of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so evident is whether it was always these personalities who have completely autonomously directed their actions, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to the pre-claimed goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have happened in the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, there is one that might be considered the head of the octopus (if there is still anyone above them I don't know, but I'm not ruling it out) - the Rothschields.
There's not much written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first press agency (Reuters) back in the 1890s to stop the association of their name with the highly criminal deeds in the background, which always meant for them to consolidate power, multiply wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against countries where shares in the central bank are not fought or are being prepared for wars (it was 7 countries before attacking Afghanistan, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore central bank status to the Rothschield Bank of America, began issuing his own (meaning government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in the theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the FED, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for launching a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars of the highest, 33, dedication to Albert Pik, the Masons of the World Wars, in the years of 1859 to 1871.
The first war was tasked with removing the large monarchist state states in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial domain of Great Britain in particular, and the third was to lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their convenience and luxury is enough and they do not consume as many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a pre-design for such a solution) and a final takeover of absolute power.
The method by a group of the richest families, headed by the Rothschields, is to trigger the crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these solutions are bogus and always lead to a deterioration in the situation (see the founding of the FED to avoid a repeat of the crises like the one they brought about in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in assassining the Habsburg Heavitan R-U of the throne, Ferdinand, to start the First World War in Sarajevo, Tsarist Russia was destroyed by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with sudden, military and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (no longer needed war to destroy Tsarist Russia), and subsequently the crumbling of the Central European power, Austria of Hungary.
To facilitate the start of the Second World War, the bankers of the politics had a latent conflictual situation created by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of impoverished masses and then it was enough to give the Germans a strong enough, culprits identifying and simple solutions to the bidding of the Führer, and further by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also playing, as they did, the function of the fifth column, in the ignition of the war fire.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschields instigated the founding of the Zionist Movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferentially in the area of the historic Judea region with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, with the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
World War II broke out, if Hitler went off the rails, on which he was initially being held by international bankers, or everything he did was plan to gauge, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world's community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was set for World War II by the reparations of war, the declaration of the state of Israel was created by the outbreak of the Third War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the second, will be a casualty in the first-line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let's just be as keenly shared by people among supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the grievance breeds a grievance in an endless chain of violence, with the greed of individuals at the beginning of everything and their desire for global power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers slip people to choose from the elections exclusively their own candidates.
Israel's current prime minister, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing his best to start a war with Iran that, would, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to escalate into a global conflict and, given the control of Iran's Strait, through which 20% of all world's oil (the navigation corridor is only 2 miles wide) as well as the destruction of the world's world's dark airborne, as well as the destruction of the world's world-class delimitation, travelled by 20% of the world's oil (the navigation corridor is only 2 miles wide) as well as the destruction of the world's world's destruction of the world's major drainage, and the destruction of the world's world'rinking wateringling over the world's largest city's-gridand is only 2 miles long to) as well as the destruction of the world's world's destruapered by 20% of all world's oil oilseaster (economics.
In what light now appear to the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn person is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And it forces all the small and the great, the rich, the poor, the free, and the slaves to have a brand on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or the digit of its name.
This must be understood: who has the sense to add the digits of the beast.
The number indicates a person, and it's the number six-sixty-six."
The film Argo: When the Wor's Earnest is, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostage.
Released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlavi, who fled to the US, which had been the patron saint of his regime for several decades, after the revolution.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it would thus fundamentally threaten trust with the allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after the negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their plight at home triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronaldo Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, Argo, describes one episode of the history that brought America a minor victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled.
After difficult periods, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew surveyed the country's locks for the set of sci-fi bigmembles.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictitious production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, with the film based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time a so-called "caper movie," the story of a successful piece, a trick - an example is the Danny's Partners series.
The film thus alternates with moods - on the one hand, the documentary-concepted sequences from Tehran (the iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film are shown - there are no big differences).
On the other side of the lightweight passage from Hollywood, treated with irony and a mild exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the meeting tables, in the corridors of the bureau, on the phone...
Ben Affleck's remarkable career reboot succeeded.
He became a respected director from the derided actor, and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first of Affleck's first film to take place in the director's home home of Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the site was among the characteristics that the director's older films elevated above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also showing it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of the confusion and the unpredictability that arises when history moves out of nowhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (a false crew at the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the narrative story doesn't actually offer much in the film's sense of thrilling scenes.
He's a little successful in working with it, sometimes making up for reality - it doesn't work out so elegantly (a scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport averts a phone call in America and a runway chase quite far-fetched).
But the weakness of the Argo is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only one in the film.
Affleck's film is kind of losing its dramatic move, a film that can be watched with mild interest, to appreciate the realisation and retro style of evoking the 1970s thrillers.
But it will be hard to pull.
As a reminder of one still in a way of living history, a testament to how exaggerated the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and a circus
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces the poll for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a contest for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU."
"We were led by the last event where the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," the poll organizer, Patrik Nacher, told Právo.
Among the absurdities nominated, for example, is the recent European Court's decision to unify insurance premium rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
Contemptuous EU regulations include the mandatory incorporation of bio-constituents into fuel, which is a detriment to nature, as a result, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made it significantly more expensive for eggs this year.
Critics have previously been faced with a virtual ban on the use of the term pomegranate butter or the removal of classic light bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimetres
The EU apparatus is often decided by the pressure of one trade or another trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic now also promotes the demands of its banks by the threat of a veto).
The lobbies' interests were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to exhibit an "anomal curvature."
The European Commission defended itself by merely harmonising the inconsistent national standards that made it more difficult to trade.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have already softened the EU, despite the opposition of some states, pointing out that the existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which the inflatable balloons must be a mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to US research here, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of death for children to asphyxiation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 when blowing into the fairground fricks.
Curious ideas are also born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves - anyone with an official function in the EU who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must speak instead of the FYROM (Former Republic of the Yugoslav of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, Banking Feesky.com has nominated, for the poll, in addition to some of the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that may have been in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which it was incarialled with a heavy fine.
The organizers of the poll were also intrigued by the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea to award subsidies for the grant.
However, these ideas were not made in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by not having the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He stated as an argument that we had a lot of grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had to complete the warehouses that it had to export.
The Czech Republic was to pay us hundreds of millions of euros for the fact that the Czech Republic continues to reach the ports, according to Palas.
The European Commission eventually reached out to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for the grant was offered to the municipality by the Ministry of Regional Development, directed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), namely to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, EU regulatory efforts, while at the same time more effective functioning and development of the entire Union, according to a number of experts, the regulations deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, experts say, is the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The emotion among Czechs is also aroused by the fact that, like other countries in the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific designations of its traditional products in Brussels, while it does not always succeed in this struggle.
While the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc's cottage cheese after a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians, but the domestic rum, the tradition of which dates back to the 19th century in our country, had to be renamed our producers.
The name of the rum can only be carried by cane products, not sugar beet products.
The official EU-registered product list has already found itself in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheese, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, or Parma hams, for example, Karlovy Vary such as biscuit, and Třeboň carp as well as Žatecký hops.
The EU's trademark can also boast Pardubice gingerbread and bitter tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does it occur to a man to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I'm not running for office.
But I can no longer watch the country steal from the last twenty years, the thieves run around, people's taxes and their retirement ages are rising.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I've turned 40 and I'm an independent outsider, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you soon set off for the Castle.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going into the fight for the Castle, depending on the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, the function is a tool for how I can make my visions happen.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest possible mandate.
But the trouble is not only that, as a nation, we curse at the pub and in front of the TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to make a change.
This will be joined by the media, which defames a person and who confuse freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to be bribing journalists or being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You went to the fight for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property declarations of over twenty million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you plan to solve this?
When I lobbied as a citizen for guides to be a free business, it was enforced.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, it is deliberately rejected, and it delays the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to gain support from all the parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party-scribing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you think of yourself as a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It's not important to me at all whether a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
I don't care whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any public-favourable solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You're the devil when someone says you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it with what you said?
When you create a business plan at a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or were spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, all you have left is the slogans.
And you don't get along with that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to get it through.
If I were elected president, it is no problem to hold a televised live broadcast, where I will ask the heads of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to say why they didn't want it.
If there is a strong figure to name the mischief, one can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, that was a credit to public pressure.
Frankly, I'm an amateur, that I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to look for allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to win majority support for my agenda.
I try to move things up on my own, if I can't, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know I won't do anything in one person, so I've been circling around a number of well-known people to see if they'd run for the Senate, too.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who turned down because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the scams of light fuel oils.
I ran, saying people were really unhappy, but now I'm on the fumble.
Sixty percent of people went to the polls, and those who went mostly elected establishment leaders.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate to make it difficult to enforce the changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or generals.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't even considered that yet because I don't have time to check out every potential party member's clean past, and I don't even have the money to do that.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand in my transparent account.
No money?
You're talking about asset declarations, what's yours?
I estimate private property to about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot worth roughly 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a £1 million Skoda Superb, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against wrongdoing and flaws.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a $60 million fortune and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Am I going to go into debt?
I've already floored into the campaign for $2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is indicative of the fact that I don't think there's much interest in my program.
And I'm not obliged to pay the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign costs will basically be covered by what my senator's salary will be.
But I wouldn't live off him, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son's English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running for office.
So you're going to continue to run a business to live?
Didn't you say you were going to dampen these activities?
But that's not to do with the salary level.
As promised, I partially dampened my activities.
For example, my representative will become the manager of a travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much was used to taking monthly as an entrepreneur?
Two to 400,000, which I'll take.
And if I were president, I'd quit my business.
The full interview can be found in Saturday's edition of Law.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not only played in the head - for example, by Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of the Books - 2 pictures
"The building seems cheerful to me, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks past the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I ask what we need a library for today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-style libraries are now volunteered to attend any of these books, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own job opportunities, which is not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality of 80,000 inhabitants shows the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted reinforced-concrete mini-concrete miniatures of the fictitious bridges that are depicted in euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not staggering.
And so the city councillors recognized that there was only one way to become the master's statistics: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural studio of the MVRDV, a master of insurciously daring column charts and a contractor of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with the usual calm and appeared at the competition meeting in 2003 with five books under his arms and the grin on his face.
And while the commission looked around, still looking around and shrugged, the insolent Maas piled his gifts to himself by his size, and ended his activist-justified speech by the words "The City of City Municipality!"
So this is my proposal for the Books Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain was piled up.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
In early November, the Book Mountain was honoured with the second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
The small-town grayness, which has so far been unable to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall behind whose white façade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer about a slightly contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Journey to the Book
First impression: reader eldorád under the cheese cover.
The middle of the mountain massif is the lift, but you will discover real spatial and reader passions only when you climb the topography on foot.
The glass-enclosed interior is bright and clear on the sides, with a baked cabinet floor and elegant street lanterns clearly expressing the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls who play football.
And books, books, books.
"Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space that is mostly unpopular and non-carry," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and we ejected the reader's space from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of the Books is skilfully used: on Wednesday there are offices, an online library, a chess club, an environmental centre and a home-based company.
A special delight is the black shelves for books that are one wall-panech, one by the sill, and sometimes by the railings of the stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are alien.
Above the unknown building material, even the avowed architects and civil engineers shake their heads.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the town municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so, in one of the frish farms, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, millimeter fleece of synthetic matter has been used as a basis under the roots.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons and then ripe for being dumped in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantities - was pressed to boards with a thickness of four centimetres.
By acting in the heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colours in a dark, homogeneous and loaded material that reeks of a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoes.
The 105 steps will reach the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long trek, you will be rewarded in a literary café with not only a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
These take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the right humidity of the air in the range of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology, despite many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
It heats and cools with the Earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands beneath the glass cover, the sun shines in only a short time, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can be handled by fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptical of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes Boekenberg as the "long-anticipated soul" of Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every city dweller was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate a book from his personal fund.
It was intended to first be filled with optical gaps in the still not-quite-equipped library, which currently comprises 70,000 pieces.
The concept has worked.
The shelves are completely full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a particular relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for the ornament.
This was the MVRDV's success in the royal discipline, which is called identity shaping in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
However young and uneducated they are.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a bigger role'
Germany abstained from voting in deciding to accept Palestine.
According to the US-Europe Relationship Expert, Stephen Szabo, Berlin is teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany first signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians' observer status proposal at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
What for?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the September 2011 rebel in Libya, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It was eventually pushed by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was so-called US-run, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are therefore between the two queues.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just settling in for themselves, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy as they have in France or the UK.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows readiness to take on national interests as well as positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
It must therefore be careful not to scare the public, but not even the elites in the Arab countries.
That's a factor.
But I wouldn't want to ascribe too much importance to it, it's not exactly a one-sided relationship.
In any case, this plays a significant role in the German reflections.
Did Germany's relations with the US hurt Germany when Germany abstained from voting in the two important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding in Europe and even the US.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a turning point as it was about Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even capitalise on some respect.
This signals that it must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, was clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think the Obama administration is probably in secret a very well-granted sympathy for the European position.
But, as a result of the political situation there, he cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I think the differences in opinions are really not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very keenly impressed with Netanyahu's policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think this is exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they cannot be part of the wider line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still unpleasant, and for this country is still difficult to play a bigger role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany accepts a bigger role, anti-German sentiment arises.
That's not making it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions, and that's not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now steadily decreasing, but the EU does not currently fill out this vacuum. Who else is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and they'll make them even more popular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, as is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is the Armani Polo?
Behind this lies the designation, which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
Nevertheless, they enjoy protection until they are sued by the brand's real owners.
Nor is it then clear whether they will enforce the rights.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing office specializing in violations of the Far East's protection rights.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to sign up on their brands.
The Gucci brand, for example, will become Lu-Gucci and have Prada-Kny registered instead of Prada.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sportswear goods Puma, are also legally copied.
The Pattloch opens with a set-up with a stamp office record in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had a sales brand protected by the Zegna DF Puma trade mark. An artificial name that also parasites on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and intellectual property violations.
There are multi-storey department stores in large cities that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But the Pattloch cases are different. On behalf of their mandants, he is acting against Chinese firms officially receiving from the trade marker the right to use the label that is already protected elsewhere from the trade mark office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
This is meant for women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any guilt.
"It's damaging to the store, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The sign is diluted, the exclusive status disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and court costs of the affected industries run into the millions, especially for expensive exemplary products.
According to data from market research company CLSA, China, with a year's 38, is the third largest market for luxury goods and a market that is growing fastest.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the register of brands is difficult to achieve and it comes at a cost.
The proceedings can stretch to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the title was "market reality" after the long term.
When the plaintiff is unlucky, he has to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal case against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German giant pump manufacturer of the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
As a result, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the star of Mercedes.
Geely, which bought the Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to forgeries from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the well-known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any guilt.
The CTMO Stamp Office admits that there were deficiencies due to too few staff and premises in 2010.
But last year, the supposedly "rush of the workforce has returned to normal from an emergency situation."
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something to do against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the 10th consecutive year.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuanes were collected in fees.
In simple terms, this means that each sign-up costs on average €1h0, or €160.
The dispute is worth several times as the case against it, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This concern has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans did achieve the cancellation of its illegal production of imitated car parts.
However, the forger continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget this, as the surnames cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office then also rejected the Munich firm's objection.
In the other two instances, while Freudenberg obtained the rights, the opponent continues to fight in the dispute today.
You need to be very careful
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that he will bring the matter to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archives, they even had to inspect the 100-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg vainly offered the opposing party a "high six-digit amount in euros" to settle the dispute.
"You can see from this what it means to us," Wentzler says.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will also hit Europe.
And that's when the imitators there secure unprotected brands.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to sign the Freudenberg for shoes and leather shoes in Germany.
The concern of business has long since given up on this business area, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
He and Mr Pattloch's lawyer advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights. Rather, foreigners would have "everything that is worth protecting, to enroll in China, to enroll in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand's last act in the last act of its drama, then it will probably have to pay the opposing party's royalties for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pressured from the market in the contentious segment.
World AIDS Fighting Day: stomping, singing, help
Heidelberg rehearses for the Imbongi chorus - and in Swaziland, it's made happy for the orphans of their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of the connection that surpasses far more than 8733 kilometres.
First there's the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps, and men's loafers look for tact on the dance floor and find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - the alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly surge, the cumbersaken and chase each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf is almost lifted from his textile shoes as he joins the voices with his suppleerly wild gestures.
It's Monday night. At the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty female singers and singers came between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher of human genetics to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy composition, each choral voice has a different text and, on top of that, a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoth, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to self-help
Unaids, the United Nations' AIDS Anti-AIDS program, estimates that there are some 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of this, 23.5 million are in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans from their parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For the 180 orphans of their parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a second-grade school.
For €15 or €20 a month, patronage can be taken over.
He guides a child's tuition fee, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "story-teller" in the language of the zulu, or "the one who graces."
In fluent bantuy, no one can speak in this space, just sing.
He has been rehearsing the songs chorus in this foreign soft talk for almost a decade, and occasionally also brings them back to where they originally come from: in the south of Africa.
In the air distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the bulk of the German congregation's voices, is in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Forty percent are infected
There are roughly 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts. A large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjen you can see in a small, what the whole of Swaziland can see: the highest HIV infectivity, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The male forecorest's circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of the disease by half, does not accept the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the weakened immunity virus in themselves. It is no rarity that they die at the age of less than 30.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a completed school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private deployment by individuals who, for a few euros a year, allowed the child to be sent to school and given him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a congregation of the "Voices for Africa" association was founded, taking care of orphans from their parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI includes syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papilomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Tin and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Ketch Institute assumes that at least four of all the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases occuring frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candis (spoch), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is widespread among heterosexual adults in the Czech Republic, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV fall in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections involve young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, we often have human papillomavids among the teens.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syphilis infected with syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 of the diseases in 2001 to 3698 illnesses in 2011.
The number of people with new HIV-infected people has been decreasing since 2007.
There were about 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about one-tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms highlight the venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the field of the genital area, difficulty in urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect yourself?
Dangers of the disease can reduce condoms, but do not offer 100% protection.
For the agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially passed on by an infection of impurities and close physical contact.
This is why experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternating sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the royalties the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
"In total, we have already sent around €200,000 to Esitjen," says the association's chairwoman, Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
It also takes care to have orphaned children find shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the zulu language is called old women, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken in 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and make sure the children come to school on time every day in uniform.
Children who no longer have one go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid for by the club as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and together with the US health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had an HIV test taken out.
It's not obvious. Though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he's dealing with sexuality."
In fact, rather strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last Ottoman monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his unpleasant lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-authorised way of life is also to the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in past decades.
But so are the many migrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse.'
To support the cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi choir travels together in the south of Africa once every two, three years together, and sings songs full of grief, belligeness, confidence in the future and self-confidence of the black, known to the black continent even from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only the mood and joy, but has also already shed tears from many of the wild frontier soldiers.
The route always leads to Esitjen, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village is hard to find on the maps, it is more than familiar in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Go to Esitjen, there's light," the people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is from here as the crow flies 8733 kilometers, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here, too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Ice cover could be in a thickness of up to 20 metres.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published by the expert magazine "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence for the fact that there is an ice sheet in the area of this planet, which lies in the permanent shadow.
This is reportedly at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
This water appeared to come from the comets, or perhaps even from the asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not link the discovery of ice to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of the scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help us to clarify how water and other basic elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy
Scenes of spiral galaxies become real works of art, according to their colour.
The shot, released by the European Southern Observatory, depicts several thousand light-leaved Tornado Trifid in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triglanic), as the dark strips of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar maternity maternity hospital into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonosh, astronomers photographed the preface of cosmic clashes: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies, and a collision must inevitably occur.

Scientists believe it was only created shortly after the Big Bang when it was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The teocerolef note was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo, Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown increasing - and the views they convey are becoming deeper and deeper.
It was the world's largest telescope for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five metres in diameter.
In the American Arizona stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows a glimpse into space through two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 metres in diameter.
The Mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its diameter is roughly eleven meters.
Inadvantage of the inexpensive of the inexpensive method of design: the telescope is provided by a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The height angle is also fixated by the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
Its peculiar feature is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arentrionko, scientists in the universe are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.

It's the Very Large Telescope - and it does honor to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can shine through the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the ESO Chile Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be full in 42 metres and is to be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
The images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten metres.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope - with a 30-meter mirror diameter.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
But the most significant impressions of the universe are conveyed to us by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Footage of distant worlds has been provided to us since April 24, 1990.
Kepler, the space telescope, has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
2. In February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The picture is documented with final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Teopellcope (JWST) will not be launched into space on board the Ariane5 rocket in 2018 as early as 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the telescopic's tasks is to find the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that there is ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as Messenger circles around this planet much closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurement had been showing for decades that there was ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink the butter a day and you'll live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be of a biblical age.
There's even a longevity museum.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be of a biblical age.
There's even a longevity museum.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
Ride the Talyš mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The minibpore rumbles down the road with many bends along the densely wooded hills, the predatory rivers and the simple peasant buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems like we're in the Schwarzwald.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Talysho ethnic group, which is not well known, except for the perfect Persian and Azerbaijani and to live a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts an overly monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow not fit for the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. The arrival from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, is too difficult.
It takes eight hours at 323 kilometres because the road is only one-lane.
The fairy-tale riches that the land owes to the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the country.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the guts to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world here next year," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the longevity museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is the life of nearly eight dozen Talyshoes from the surrounding area who are over the age of a hundred. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still produced a child.
The disputed star of this museum, however, is the shepherd of the sheep Şirali Müslümov, who is believed to be 168.
But the birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayev explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov befitting at his age by a few decades?
However, the aged people in Central Asia was also heard by Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"Conderly, many people of old age also live in some areas of China, in Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documents, no scientific evidence of the age can be given, especially when the registrations are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik live a biblical age conspicuously remarkably.
There are currently 20 people who are over the age of 100.
So why do so many aged people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special Talyš genes.
The director of the Fatulyva Museum, on the other hand, believes it is in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the calorie diet of the Talysts, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter on a daily basis, that is so healthy, is not exactly plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, resides Rubaba Mirzaev.
At the age of 97, it is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 children, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with the butterfly he wads relentlessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzajeva's sons and a daughter. They're both grandparents long ago.
There are also two young children bouncing around.
In the kitchen, the guest room is prepared with tea, which is served in the typical "armadu" bellies.
Mirzaev's white teeth form the perfect line, and under the scarf shears a long dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals from us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they didn't look like it and keep the color.
"I never used shampoo either," Mirzajeva says.
Monthly retirement to live is enough
She ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In all my life, I've never bought food in a supermarket.
Then he tells me about his man, who was in the military.
The worst was during World War II.
But all improved when the oar was taken over by the "beloved father" Geydar Aliyev.
Promotion sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan do not suffer from a lack of need.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros). That's an amount for the circumstances here that's good to live on.
And perhaps Mirzajeva's long-grey son is also right: "Old people enjoy great respect for our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
Unless it's a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term 'human rights' is lacking in the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The disbursed demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep ambivalence.
A sharp debate about a future constitution based on sharia law.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And for doing so, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was for the nation, but primarily for the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secular persons.
For all of them, still hopelessly quarrelling in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's state" on the Nile, on the love of a powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds the title of doctor to the South California doctor, really wants to save, is not the Egyptians or the world clear.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
234 sections, which were hastily approved by the Islamist-dominated Constitutional Assembly in a 15-hour night marathon, are partly alarmed.
As in earlier constitutions, this proposal is said to be that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal open space for a more rigorous interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this illuminates the newly added section: In all Sharia matters, it is necessary to consult the al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence over the whole of Sunni Islam.
That may not be the case, but it may mean that the clergy will supervise the legislature, which would effectively result in the judiciary revoking its right.
There are many things to interpret in the draft constitution
The problem is also that the civil authority of the military courts is to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and support its morale and values."
This is legally formulated in such an inaccurate way that, by this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of the arts and literature.
In intelligible language, this means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
But another paragraph prohibits defamation or slander the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
What is unclear, however, remains what the defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally dubious to the wording that "peeping people" is forbidden.
In this case, is a cartoon of the President or a joke at the expense of law experts?
The matter of interpretation, such as much more in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, in his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular vote.
"Revolution has returned"
For several weeks, the opposition has been forming against the outnumbered by the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity in Tahrir Square in Cairo's Tahrira Square on Friday night, pledging to destroy the constitutional charter before it becomes effective.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradeej, said the draft constitution belonged to the "jump-off of history."
Through the short-card service, Twitter accused Morsi of seeking to "coup against democracy."
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition figure member Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a reborn, but for the sake of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile outside the Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who called out, "The people are demanding the application of God's law."
They called on Morsi, "Worked the country!" and assured: "The Cermal is our Constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the Tahrir symbolic square, on which it all began, would probably provoke a similar civil war.
Morsi's supporters clearly didn't want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and proponents of the draft constitution were vocal and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is to go.
A majority is considered certain in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' is not found once'
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is being raised by Hafea'a Sa'd.
The 47-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail for Mubarak or were on trial.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now, in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi's extension of power to all three of the state's power forces forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
The Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of the Nile's ideological factions with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
The demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian raft: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway are enjoying one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for the extraordinarily smelly fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
This gives you the smell of the paralyzing smell of the raftisk, one of the biggest Norwegian delinquents.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a beautiful view - and a pervasive smell hangs in the air.
The cockopic is salted trout fermented in the water for up to a year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, as best to put it, the most compelling meal.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also a so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival's course.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people are more aquavovated than rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can be overwhelmed by the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that's been on the bus road.
The crisp is a product of a very different time when Norway was in poverty, and because there were no refrigerators, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were undoubtedly dulled with alcohol.
Only one generation before thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and a large-scale care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival who, not so long ago, were much richer than Norway, are pouring into the country for work.
The raffque is viewed as something important, indispensable, if a rather stinking part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even if it's all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) a piece.
Norway is often in the hands of global news - and it seems to suit most of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children in the past year, is still mentioned here with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called "the action of 22. July".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says our waiter Anna, wearing a plate with a loose raft, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, considered people.
Her English, as is the English of most of the people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We're not getting married, we don't like pomp.
Norway is very cautious about its oil richer - in addition to a small percentage, most of the industry's money is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial crash was throwing around the money they didn't have, the Norwegians had the strings tightly tight on their bellies.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat a raftisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of a raffle.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and it's beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the smell of fish is back.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where the raftcrumpcender is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding fish for the smell.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast in which the bowler is surrounded by bowl saucer saucer with a racket.
It's like the Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps overwhelmed with aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a tough start
As Mexico's incoming president, Enrique Pena Nieto, he is preparing to take over the office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, there were steel barriers to closeings to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the nation's leadership.
He faces a challenging task.
Mexico has done well economically at the time of the outgoing Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the clutches of the drug war, which has already taken an estimated 60,000 lifetimes in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to enable us to achieve this.
Before he shook hands with the US president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Direct man.
In the rural town of Valle del Bravo, for example, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and to build infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that were there before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of the modern sports center and the imposing interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring about real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state member for the party of President Pena Nieto, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so badly needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected to be seen by Enrique Pena Nieto within the party.
And he rejects the opposition's comments that characterize the new president as a man with no substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very biased with the country's excellent vision.
He is a great statesman and, above all, a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that has many people in its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of the Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Settle beneath the highway overpasses, it resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the military was called in to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially the burning is violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to the huge waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was the governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place that is synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the problem of women's murders in his time in office.
And, worse, their leadership is blamed for closing his eyes.
In the concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photographs of his late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got to her house, it looked as if her body had been washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of punching, and the posthumous stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana stares down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice."
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But that can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority for the duration of his tenure.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," says V Valle del Bravo MP Olvera.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's claim regarding the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the abusive treatment of Manning in prison.
The private is charged with stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the biggest leak of secret material in US history, has missed many of the possibilities of complaining of the rough treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor has. Ashden Fein cross-examining Private Manning at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede claimed in Maryland that records of weekly visits that Manning had with the officers of the unit had with the officers of the unit's custody over the course of nine months in Virginia do not show any complaints about mistreatment.
The cross-appointed interrogation in the course of a hearing on the defence's motion to dismiss the case against Manning on the ground of gross treatment at the time of the detention, which is in itself a sufficient penalty, took place a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
An Army Intelligence Analyst, arrested in June 2010, is charged with the theft of thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein and Manning went through the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantico detention centre, where he was held in a high-security mode from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked the Manning questions and rehearsing his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and assessed the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints about ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems orally, and that the officers who visited him had discussed these concerns with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but had not noticed these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about the treatment of his person in January 2011 when he met with a commissions assessing suicidal ideation, which he had expressed in the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during the course of that meeting, his intention to obtain a reduction in the "prevention of injuries" mode.
The military said it had used the restrictive regime (one stage under the regime's supervision for the sake of suicide) to protect it and protect it.
"I wanted the detention guards to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... to enjoy the increased quality of life I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and being taken to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once there for heat fainted.
He said that he had not been allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very disheartening.
"My world has shrunk to the Arifjan base, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell with no company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, a slip-up, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying was against the regulations during the day.
Manning said he had always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face, when he turned the other way in the night, he was woken up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for the charges he had leveled in Thursday's testimony, alleging that, after being forced to sleep one night in his Telic cell naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other fellow students in the morning's count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to be allowed to cover himself with his blanket when he counted.
At Friday's interview conducted by Judge Manning, he said that, by order of his guards, he had decided that he had a blanket that could be covered, to be postponed, but admitted that no one had given him the order to be deferred.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a seat belt from his underwear or his backpackers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his underwear, his backpackers and his glasses, had been removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes the judge will take into account his experience of imprisonment and that his sentence will be significantly reduced in the case of his convictions before the court-martial, the start of which is expected at the start of next year.
The defense said it was planning to say that Manning would plead guilty in the lower offences and that he would fight other charges because they were too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said the statement that Manning was held in accordance with the regulations regarding all those arrested in maximum security detention.
The allegations against Manning include facilitating the enemy, the illegal inflicting of the online release of news documents, the transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If he is charged on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of possibilities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of the hard times, he says.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made my way through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The darts pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Submitters").
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston are called "Irays" and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Italy."
So later, I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the interview in that language.
However, I do not have a vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't shake off my American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and queued up for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House this week.
The program's agenda was the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are equally likely to stay in Mexico as they would travel to the United States.
It wants to merge with the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, though he provided no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to rewrite half of Mexico's territory to the United States under threat of weapons.
But for Mexicans who think in the space of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are pervasive.
So, a minute after a United States official says something just a little critical of Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and the elite complaints about how Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will start on the war trail.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people the country offers options to, and others that don't.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origins from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living an American dream, not a Mexican dream.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is to the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they view us as a low-end race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence, in their view, is only a failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they would never have left him.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally traveled to the United States in her childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Though a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don't feel part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have the roots in either.
In Mexico, he views us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered to be Mexicans.
And to make relations even more difficult, some Mexican leaders want to reconnect with the diaspora, and some of the intelligentsia, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "social ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should be telling our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country and pressure political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for forgave the way they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel resentment for the way it was treated with their family members in the considerably closer past.
Hmmm.
We may be more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such do not happen is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary conjecture about who started it, many buildings have been turned into a wreck, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza fell near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even if the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be caught up in their long-ago conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and the Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are caught up in the region's chaos.
It may cause their fight to be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this may break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason to be optimistic at the moment.
Even if the cease-fire stopped closed on November 21 lasted, the fighting this week was reinforced by hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that they have forced the Israelis to retreat, even as Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of the 1.7 million Gaza people in one of the most reprehensible and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, currently run by its staunting rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, giving Hamas powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a reunited regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas. So is Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas say that the Islamic crescent is encircling itself around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah's party/military reigns, through Syria, where rebels increasingly leaning to Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the kings.
Above all, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab countries, the balance in the region, changed the balance.
Hoshna Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
The Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more impressionable public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be expelled by Israel or America.
In contrast, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back into a crate.
Israel's Iron Dome missile system proved its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as steadfast as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Even though rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been relatively calm in Israel from the suicide bombers, some of the wall that extends into the West Bank, the main parts of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality to international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party allied with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing rockets, like their compatriots in Gaza did?
We'd better hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick out their heads.
Hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
While Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries are not in much love with Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than that of all of its four Arab neighbours combined.
Launching a new war with the local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments heal their economies.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to reach a cease-fire is a good sign and can mark the start of something new.
Israelis, too, should look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, the denial of the rights to the Palestinians is creating a self-determination of the powder keg that must explode one day in the areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already at this time, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza held every few years to push back Hamas will increasingly collect diplomatic toll.
Both sides need external incentives.
The answer is what the sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world, and the following: two states where Israel ceding territory for reasons of security.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping the fire will give the pressures from the outside at least a little more of an impact on the enforcement of the matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must work to halt the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state founded on the 1967 border with the replacement of part of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
The Arabs on the outside also have to push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereign sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state state state.
President Obama also has a piece on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
At his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's plaintively shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packaging have come into force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are marked with warnings for smokers and diseased body parts.
Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the first of their kind in the world, have come into force, and the brands' logos and colours have been replaced by general olive green packs with heinous pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and newborns-disappears as a result of their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and images, the only difference between boxes between the boxes of the names of the marks, which are printed in the same small print, are mandatory.
This is the strictest regimen in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government argues that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by depriving the habit of depriving him of his attraction.
It is relying on studies that show that if people don't start smoking until the age of 26, there's a 99% chance of never starting to smoke.
"Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies as saying, for example, that children associate children with the crown in their logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar actions.
The tobacco industry lobbied harshly against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that this law would increase trading on the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will make serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Fighters from China and Indonesia will bring in much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Another argues that the law has increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-run firm, said the demand for silicone cigarette packaging to cover the disgusting packs, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals to the laws of the Austral Supreme Court increased from near-zero sales.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesale dealers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts cite the popularity of social media in the demographic group targeted at.
After a series of Australian law banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and demanding that most vendors hide their cigarettes from a direct eye, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing officer in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by the "average Honza."
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the trouble to create this video, or is that a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to handle the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia are significantly traffickering.
The SOO decision is expected to be delivered in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and shove the pack back," says Victor El Hage, buying a box of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack tobacconist in downtown Sydney, says it makes it harder for him to level the shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's the end, we'll close the shop,' he said, and threw up.
In a world of constant connectivity, it's not so bad to be bored
I spent the last Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts in children's development are increasingly coming up with praise for the boreholes of the bourgeois.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don't get a chance to enjoy the boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a rather new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Canada in Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History, says (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, originating from the first century of the A.D.
And then there's also a question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and showing the idea to the target group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me but I was unable to do."
Boredom differs from apathy by the fact that the person is not involved in nothing but would like to be.
He says there's no compulsion for apathy to do anything.
He says that the crux of boredom is "the disillusionment of the attention process, coupled with a poor mood and a feeling of slowly passing time."
Boreodes can be a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship, bored people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading an article from a magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these problems to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or intriguing task, disrupting attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that the twisting and scribbling, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can in fact help to fight with boredom and keep people more attentive to physically.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to fidget will learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom at some point - the delay in my flight, the humming speaker, the particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the "Stuplets for Prernage to Hazard" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many of the things I have to do is repeat and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all.".
With these scales, scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and various external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally inert.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "succupiliating is the peak time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boring good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in their extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not in the long run.
So if your baby is bored and you give it an iPad, they won't be bored anymore, but they won't learn how to entertain themselves or manage on their own, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transmitted from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will learn not only how to entertain himself, but will gain more control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we should not be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant strumming of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly oversimplified," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain yourself when the noise is switched off."
There's no handbook in Colorado on the new marijuana law
Thinner Anthony Orozco, a college senior lecturer and a football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he rode with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued for a summons for drug possession and drug-treaty use-for-surgery offences for each which are fined for each of us as a USD 100 - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the right.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offences have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures, to be cancelled.
Police departments have stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts said they would continue with existing marijuana cases, and still accuse people for possession.
At the same time, several towns from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-recognized marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads are also scratched by regulators in the state of Washington.
And they're looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is first ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's going to be a good guide," Brian E. Smith, the Washington State Department's Councillor's Leiploman License.
But, as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do any more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent to follow," he said.
Washington law, the so-called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but a legal holding will.
And there are messy mechanical questions that need to be resolved over the course of this period, such as how to balance the state's "corresponding access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on the cannabis trade to 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, recently founded research groups.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers in informing his officers that the city's prosecutor would no longer prosecute the offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the district of Weld, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Precisely, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, although many of them are facing further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were crimes at the time they took place," Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places like the country's Mesa county, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in the Grand Junction, the district's largest city, no longer blame adults for holding a small number.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado's voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the opposite reactions across the state revealed, in view of this great state green experiment, a deep ambivalence among local officials.
For district prosecutors, it's a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents marijuana possession defendants, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best path for national drug legalisation cases.
Defense attorneys and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalized sales, while also scrupulously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will acquiesce.
Despite several arrests by medical-mobra, marijuana vendors and patients who use it, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana shops in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While narcotics agents are unlikely to set off the door to pick up a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will resist allowing state-regulated holiday marijuana stores called by the new laws, Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on President Obama's administration's anti-drug policy.
Several of the Colorado cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to advance.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums for any new marijuana business, though it will take another year or so to open any store.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a position to issue a license to someone and then get a big federal issue out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for, as opposed to what the state voted.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
It is not just today's university students who are being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's largest home of knowledge, a modern overcooked Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of entering Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and ran into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had given up because I objected to making the students' lovesies in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said cheerfully that I had left because I was forced to drink from battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of the supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm bringing this up now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students on the right of the center suffers from such persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that a group of these students sought the same equal protection as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the younger years association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that, because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and show that they are not welcome."
They are calling for a position to be established in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they are free to communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary programme, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Fair Land: Young, Intelligent and Right-wing) about the student political action, which portrayed the conservatives as oddballs and neo-Nazis.
The show featured a graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who rode a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and wearing a silver-headed club.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "scapegoers" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, a vice president of Nottingham University, the Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People believe we are like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus, Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while OUCA's 19-year-old elected president, Stephanie Cherill, says that JCR members' approach to people to people to the right of the center has been aggravated.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the well-being of the members' living conditions," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and cripplingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most severe.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refuse to honor the honorary degree of former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would also be shivering with fears.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students meet with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the wormwood that was to come.
I found that not only do the professors silently approve of the needling of conservative pupils, but they are also keen to participate.
The timber-panelled auditoriums were brought into the timbered stripe, privatisation and resistance of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture was to translate a French text from the 18th century to English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now the deceased), "move the first paragraph, please."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake dough, was very bilious.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt growled.
I went back to my room devastated.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a slight tap on the shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as an OUCA member.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be a lambite.
Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted on not agreeing with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics, who (was ironically) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were notching with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do the Conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're hitting each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour and curb my natural tendencies?
Three years before me developed as a purgatory of disregard for ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based on my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who make speeches to her.
He was almost not there.
He hated the place for its parochiality and pettiness and for its embodiment on the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he took up the post of professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for a haven for my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city's dream moods.
Even my communist friends have always had the perfect manners.
His wet eyes were somber.
Try again.
I'm sure it's a joke.
My heart would break if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a Conservative Party supporter, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of teaching, when another professor of history declared in absolute esteem that I was a "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even when I blushed with shame inside, I confessed to "the parents were brainwashing me" and called them "old fools."
Relief was only short-lived.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns for Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
After they left, I packed up my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You could call me a snot-nosed weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and poisonous in the educational institution.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 Conservative prime ministers emerged, but which is also hitherto hiding behind an undeserved reputation of the place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: The Master of Fashion, which opened this week in London, ABC spoke to Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, ancient residence of Isabella I. England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: the master of fashion" that represents more than 130 models of the top-of-the-line fashion models created by his studio for the past 50 years.
"I adore this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honored clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the precious and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will run until 3 March, brims with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as the trophils of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Vogher in the north of Italy to idol of the international "bohemian elite."
Raising the royal family is no bad thing.
"At least they don't put a cigarette stalker in a great carpet like some gorgeous pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains the guests in abundance and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains "Heini's ex-wife" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.'
Valeria Mazzová performs Valentina
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
'It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after a parade in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every little thing of his apartment, his decoration, his food, the music, everything, he was able to feel his spirit.
He made all those invited feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the Priteenth Fashion Week in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Parade of nobility
Gravani's life is not an obsession, but a truly reerum of loves.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passage that offers a roster exchange: the visitor turns into a model and marches through a passage to watch the "general of the dreams of Valentin's masterpieces worn by Valentin's masterpiece as a dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy to her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Noci," or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
The mannequins' audience shines with names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurnu and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Austria.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's first is like first love, "it's impossible to forget about him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muse.
"I give him priority over others for his femininity and great love for women because she underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, brighten up a lot and give a "spark" to her face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she wore Valentino for the first time.
Growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It eventually came in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first Valentino dress to mark the occasion of my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that wore a ruffled skirt, a gouged bodice, and a hangerless top.
It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigu d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has the designer's solemn dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that they have in them."
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress from her wedding to Pavel Greek in 1995.
To create these ivory-colored silk dresses with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a four-and-a-half-metre long train, it took four months of work and 25 "intoes" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the landmark of the ultimate fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society."
Valentino dazzled over the years of the elitist "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Stop Medal in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Order of the Honorable Legion of Honor accumulate as many honours as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, his peace, his neat, and the perfect appearance," the princess acknowledges d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was impeccable, time left no trace on him.'
When the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, the porters in the Indonesian volcano area are gamble with their lives and hello as they lay 70 kilos of sulphur down on steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case for Anta Wijay, one of the 400 miners who make his living by conquering sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, they have to fry every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gases escape from the inside of the Earth and pass into a solid state when in contact with the air.
After chopping up large sulfur blocks, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, they carry them on the shoulders in two bamboo baskets along the steep stone trails.
The top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres, is only 250 metres, but it takes the exhausted carriers to climb up at the turtles' pace, as they keep their balance and carefully contemplate their steps to avoid slippageing and crashing into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could cost them their life, as happened to a French tourist who collapsed years ago from the rocks of Kawah Ijen.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulfur they extract
When they're up, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has benefited from the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupies (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening of sugar.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes the three journeys a day.
One trip takes him three hours and is destroyed at the end, but he can earn 13138,000 rupees (€11.5) per day.
While this seems to be a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what he would make in the field.
"The daily wage for the miners is very high here. For example, collecting coffee is paid for 15,000 rupees (€1.2) per day, and the salary per fortnight is two million rupees (€166))," explains the porter who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.2) per day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is as convincing in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, it's hard to breathe, coughs all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks living in the Kawah Ijen volcano three times a day, the sulfur of which has already begun to take its toll on it, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's hard to breathe, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that leak from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will be working for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than a decent English.
This likeable and intelligent young man, troubled by the fate, could be a tourist guide, waiter or a hotel receptionist, and instead does the work of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up at two o'clock every day because the sulfur continues to flail at night and its distinctive yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness of the phaser, Anto's pharate, illuminating his journey with a small flashlight he has attached to his helmet and bought it with his own money.
About 400 porters carry on the shoulders of a sulfur basket from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanised the sulfur mining to cost savings, nor does it provide the carriers working on their own and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from the photography supplement, which, together with the ticket for 15,000 rupees (€1.2), is collected by the nature park keepers from the tourists arriving to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the cattle, and not for the people," says Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old carrier who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left the schools.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will keep working, "as long as possible" because he needs the education of his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although the sulphur burns its throat and stings in its eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and captures the miners in the dense fumes that emerge from the volcano, the miners are so hard to say that none of them complains that they suffer from serious illnesses... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
The unainik who balances his basket on his back can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day he and his colleagues dig out 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which the three trucks then take the steep route between the thicket to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares, opening a wide mouth in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, a 30-year-old, also makes his living by mining the sulfur.
Time passes, but the incessant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore seeks out babies to save economy
Singaporeans are blamed for not having children, careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. Let's fulfill our civic duty and we will be born a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the ad for menthol slushes, but still - or perhaps because of it - the video in Singapore earlier this year was massively expanded to YouTube.
These theorems are part of a rap that uses local innuendoes like "let's beech in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes to highlight the problem with this ad in a witty way.
The agency's artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people "a civic duty" done to work out.
"This is entirely an issue of the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our population, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like expanding pheromone perfume or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas might have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative possible thing, such as the composition of rap, to solve the problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures have had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy urban state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The fertility rate in Singapore, with a view to stratification of the population, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the fertility rate exceeded the value of the birth rate was as a rate of renewal, in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and the Family of the National Office for Population says it's for "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"People have a wider range of life's goals and priorities at their disposal, it's not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing the number of single people and the postponement of marriage and the procuring of children. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While immigration policy involved efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against a decline in population, this has provoked resentment among local residents.
Some of the Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low pay and a lack of effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the governing Singapore party recorded its worst election result since independence began last year.
After the election, there was an effort to address the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected aftermessages
While the fall in the birth rate has seen effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health-care spending, and immigration policies, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying to keep so many small houses from being built.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as the "footbox" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and have been a great success in salesmanship.
Nevertheless, it is feared that these apartments can support the bachelor's lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the property developer EL Developers, says their "shoisbox" sells far faster than bigger houses.
"They're more popular, selling for days to weeks faster than larger-scale houses.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously capped when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a single project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules could be aimed at increasing the birth rate of the nation, a conversation with the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as are education, so many people postpone it," says the young official.
"The others have children.
But for me it is important to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old.
Both men and women mention their careers, stress and cost of living and their education as reasons preventing them from having children.
So, however the government is trying to force the citizens to have children, it is the Singaporeans who have the last word on starting a family.
What is a private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to the vocabulary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that is of a personal nature or "the area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance."
What is privacy for a man under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the internet matters he would certainly not have told anyone in his normal communications?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases, they considered the notion of privacy to be "something entirely of its own" on a personal level and a "user name and password" if it was social networks.
"My biggest secret I would not release," says 10-year-old Jorge, in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he claims.
"On FB I give nice pictures or pictures of us playing.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that would make a mockery of someone," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are related.
Among them is the mother, who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started an Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never have accepted a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even be interested if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and admits to the latest network that he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not worried about it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them pointed him out to him, nor did he want his address or phone number.
"If they urged me or demanded it from me, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
Jose made the call to Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
This boy is no stranger to experience with what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
"The well-known friend was blackmailed on the social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never learned who it was," he confirms.
The victim, according to Jose, did not get out of the account.
"She just activated her private mode."
Then he explains a series of steps to safely set the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do that if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he claims.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Teaching, believes that, in order to get to the right orientation of children and adolescents in social networks, they must understand that the main aim of these networks is to inform.
He states that: "The Internet originated as a means of seeking information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of teaching at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Reagents and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born during the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, yet we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what the other way around is not, at an age when they are not yet mature for it."
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - to be deliberate, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are some things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or: Would you like to see someone posting your picture as you posted a friend's?
You know what the others are publishing about you?
When you tag the people in the pictures of the celebrations, did you ask these people's permission?
And one more: Do they all want to know what you're doing right now?
The next point is to make them realise that they have to behave in the internet environment the same way they do outside of it.
It's the same rules.
"You are governed by respect, morality and other principles outside the internet, and one should be the same on social networks," he claims.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-grade teacher and an educational adviser, explains the need for children's parents to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If they understand every trickiness, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that setting up an online account can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional "not to talk to strangers" rule.
South America Summit Ends and the Lima Declaration Not Discounted
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and was reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
The eahead agency has repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of state or government of Unasur, but representatives of both the Foreign Ministry and the presidential office, who initially stipulated that it would be published after the summit, said it would be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They also said the content was released by Peru's President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had their access to information restricted throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message "confidential session, sound transmission to be avoided."
A small amount of information available to the journalists was provided by the press officers of some of the governments who were present, but not the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of attending presidents, which prompted the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is just a statement by President Humala and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-País Orabes Árabes) and, even on this occasion, the initially promised Lima Declaration was not released, although it was keenly required by the press.
The official ASPA website shows that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the supply of information.
The summit ended with, among other things, a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President of Chile Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday would begin hearing the dispute launched by Lima against Santiago.
"We will subtract and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are hearing in this international court today," President Humala and his Chilean counterpart said.
"The chil was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, agreements and international courts," Piñera said, greeting President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that he would submit to the International Court of Justice's ruling was made public after Colombia's adopted the Bogota Pact this week, in submitting to the judgments of the International Court of Justice that ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the decision to be completely flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and closing the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read out the final document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and action was planned for 31 projects among South American countries, with investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the member countries of UNASUR would take "important steps towards the target of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended."
He informed that actions were being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) has no winning essence, but is to be used to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different South American locations, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries more interconnected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a reading speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects involved Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to the coast to Brazil, and the other two related to a better link with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations" from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues highlighted by the summit was that Latin America would remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is whole and has good neighbourhood relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to hear with respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the dispute over the maritime border dispute contested by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor the treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilised and considerate possible form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of the country's president, Enrique Peña Niet.
As part of the summit, the EU's defence ministers met tentatively to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the field of defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently out of the question.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a joint citizenship is a goal in which 'South America, in this case, really has to be taught from Europe'.
Correa, who attended the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Nations Union (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that Europeans "kidmitted themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create South American citizenship, which the member countries of the Unasur organization support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any of the South American countries that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of reverse that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The Ecuadorian president said, among other things, that he agreed to reshuffle the Organization of American States (OAS), on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and those who signed the Human Rights Pact of San José.
"Those in the lead are never committed to anything, and we South Americans, on the other hand, sign it all.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador's WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Assange might be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to submit to an interrogation on Swedish territory for an alleged sex offence, with "theré Swedish legislation allowing for a video referendum interview with a video referendum call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk of suffering physical and mental health in Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he's got minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he is in danger of deteriorating his physical and mental condition because he is locked in a small space with no possibility of moving in the fresh air.
This would affect everyone's health," he said.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks have taken place with London to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We are not negotiating on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there were ongoing talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer, Balthazar Garzón, is leading a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
He said that "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Mr Assange's Sweden interviews at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or Skype, as the legislation there allows for it without a problem and, as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be the end tomorrow.'
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, clarifying that he was by no means intolerant of "sub-standard, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The biggest enemies of the free press are not us, the underwhelming and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this perspective, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "neither bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie, control Ecuador," and suggested that if he was re-elected, "he would continue to make changes driven the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to continue maintaining the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership of the Unasur union until at least its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism wrapped in legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."
In addition, the President of Ecuador's said he considered "as a perfectly appropriate" wish for his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the ruling of the International Court of First Instance in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not accepted at the moment.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome with their will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly to be overcome and be allowed to go forward."
He also expressed hope of settling the maritime border dispute before the same court, Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek out international instances if both countries commit to accepting a judgment, no matter how harsh."
In the context of the possibility of running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third mandate in the next presidential election, he noted that he perceived this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
"Personally, I have never been interested in much, but such unjust situations as socially economic poverty in Ecuador can be corrected only by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential term, and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, I'm in for the same thing.
I have already made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I've just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez went to a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state attended today in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of Southamans of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded by calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bolt of lightning hit me," he tells me, recalling the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "slighten" a little, but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his own sickness to his own shoulders and began to inform himself of it. With such dedication that he's already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the most so-called HIV patients at the Civic Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubt, little treatment and a greater stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
At the time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who are unaware of their illness and only come when the virus caused the body's destruction and has exhausted the immune system, and they then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS, or at least from the first documented cases, "it has been a major achievement for the patient's life expectancy to start treatment in a timely and appropriate manner," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, saying that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS addendum and specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full-fledged life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, better off being those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years.
Simply put, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "at to live without problems until 75 years of age," the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAAIDS) Joint Programbook (UNAIDS) Joint Programbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since AIDS was discovered, according to national statistics.
255 people died in the state of Jalisco alone in 2011 and 187 so far until this May. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral agents has been provided.
- Why do people continue to die from the disease?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the stock of pharmaceuticals. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the state of the disease, or in the late stages of the disease."
Adds a convincing statement: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection already emerges. The only thing that needs to be done to be able to do more in order to be able to influence overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, so we need to offer tests on a large scale to identify the disease to all those who ask for it."
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the StateAIDS Council in the state of Jalisco, as well as with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have his tests done at the private laboratory simply because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have a run-in three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy, I exercise, I take medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like anyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today as part of World AIDS.
"Let them have the tests done. If they took a risk, let him know as soon as possible, if they're HIV-positive, it's better. And if they've been diagnosed, whoever they realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message of his summarizes the slogan of the Battle of AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programmes and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a guadalajar journalist who is researching information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In the places that are dedicated to this task "it has actually been increased that condoms are given to us, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages of even a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new outbreaks are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is the common question of irony and judging from social workers, school consultants, pharmacy staffers and medical staff who do to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Let condoms not just be behind the shelves, but let the hundred be in the dispensaries in the public toilets, in places where the young often go.
"It's not promiscuous support.
Nor is it about "paying for beer and a motel" to them, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There's no suchsexuality. It is best to make condoms accessible to those who already lead sex life," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This state of affairs in Mexico marks fourth place in new and identified AIDS cases and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the diseases are sexual, 6% blood route y 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people on one registered case who are unaware of the disease.
The judgment approved by the U.S. appeals court, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, gives rise to a detrimental precedent for any national enterprise with branches in the neighbouring country and solvency problem.
So it seems that the restructuring practices of firms that are made up by Mexican law do not apply in the country of lanes and stars, despite the international agreements.
Approval of the judgment delivered 15. In June last year, Judge Harlin Hale at the bankruptcy court for North Texas, he leaves, in practice, Mexican companies, undefended against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the Canadian main glass producer to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing three irregularities.
It should be noted at the outset that, while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the U.S. Insolvency Act, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the main course of action is for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would point to the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, a model law of the United Nations was created for this purpose to unify international trade law, which is determined by the arbitrator to the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without a vote of the branches from the internal enterprise structure, where Vitro's debt to the branches is recognised, the requested majority would not be achieved to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is permitted by Mexican law.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples of Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the in-house debts were guaranteed by the Federal RBAR.
In addition, it is true that even after the members' votes are deducted, creditors - who were against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "supers" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court accuses Vitro of the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
Meanwhile, the family's firm, Gonzáleze Sady, will file an appeal for reassessment directly before the Court of Appeal to take place with full attendance, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because only three voted.
If he fails here, he will seek as an appeal to review the process of the higher-level instances, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
What is serious about the case is that the court omitted a document sent to the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae unit in detail, in which Vitro's approach under the Bankruptcy Act is described in detail, in which it is pointed out that the company has made it easier for itself to move towards the agreements signed by the two countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act of the United States.
Moreover, it points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors alike.
Impact on both sides: a punishment for both Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Unnoticed, the Mexican aviation union's criminal complaint against the former owner of Gastón Azcárragga, who had been accused of fraudulent conduct, had been on the table for months, and the vessel had already overflowed, according to the pilots' union organization.
The institute, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to the Authority, the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor's Office for the United States of a transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which it selected 198 million pesos from IXE from Fideikomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were most likely directed to purchase shares by the Professional Hotel Administration (Administration of the Professional de Hoteles).
As is well known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Sieging Dragon Marta
The Universidad de Caribe campus brought together over the weekend with a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association to prevent the opening of China's Dragon Marta in Kankoun.
We are talking, as we know, a huge commercial and distribution centre with "a land with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential service for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Earlier, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental compound that would partly devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the matter with ACTA
The Senate's request, which was disregarded by the government, which sought an explanation of the conditions under which the Mexican ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known as ACTA, was lost in topicality, to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As is well known, this was despite the fact that the Board itself ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to the freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Bathball was my life"
Basketball world-braker Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was associated with this hall sport for more than 60 years and traveled the world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was passionate about the field in the 2008green wheelchair with a stroke of strokes in the sport for over the age of 60, whether as a younger player, a national basketball league player, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or the president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation.
"I have held a lot of roles in basketball during my life, including several simultaneous ones, as when I was president of the national league of the BSN, the general manager of the national team and the chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora newspaper reporters at his home in Bayamon, home with Isabel, for more than 50 years with Isabel, his loyal wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenirs from his long career, testify to that.
Bayamón in the Heart
With the greatest emotion of all, it is guarding those that recall his time at the Vaqueros ticket from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"That was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Vaqueros draw team since 1967, whether as the owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one of the championships - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
At that time, the team was taken over by "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I recall Gene Bartow, who was previously a coach here and was a coach at the time of the Alabama University in Birmingham, said to me, "I have a strapping, 6-foot-2 player for you.
You want it?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon victory in the championship, he would then contribute to the next one.
He enjoyed the championship, when the Vaqueros draws played by Gauss, but only at a distance, having already served as president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself to his full capacity and enjoy Mincy's position in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the qualifying Olympic Cup in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Championships in 1990, where we finished fourth, but we should have had a bronze not if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final face-off," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as is the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and whipped out the United States team that was pretty much like the one that blew our bronze at the World Championships.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also there were youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have had a perfect composition but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With the roster players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players out of the question in the Panamerican Mar de Plata games, we won the gold despite all the forecasts.
What was the best player for Puerto Rico?
That was without any doubt, Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piclinin.
Not to mention his time in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I love Leo Arillo's work very much.
Which success do you consider to be the biggest in the federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league had as many as 17 teams in one season.
What'd you get to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, as a breakdown of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce guys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now the kids are traveling a lot and playing too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, the assistant referees and the referees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I listen most to music, I watch YouTube videos of music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for John Ross Ewing's lead role, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the ferocious oil tycoon J.R. Ewinga in the television series Dallas became a symbol of the lacquer in the 1980s, and died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer-related complications, according to the family's official announcement to the Associated Press.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played again the iconic role he liked best," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in Dallas Hospital," her agent, Jeffrey Lane, announced.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'd miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a cancer was found on his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
In the years before the Dallas airing, Hagman made himself famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie, aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, the astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (jin) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His appearances in the films included roles that were well received by the critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's championship performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R., who took him to the starling peak.
CBS's drama series about the Ewings clan and other figures around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Djicare?" who was supposed to raise expectations about a work full of emotions, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only a tremendous number of speculations from viewers around the world, but also the risk to millions of dollars in the touch offices.
This also helped this feature to set a ratings record.
The November episode of 1980, in which the response was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas thus became the second most-watched entertainment programme in history after the end of the 1985 series MASH's broadcast, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot at by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, who then threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an greedy greedy-backed smile: a wacky businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be put into rehab.
"I know what I want J.R.'s to have on a tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: "Here lies the honorary citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for the millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been so lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new series Dallas aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The shooting of five episodes of the second series has already been completed and the sixth one was just being filmed," the TV station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no announcement available from Warner or TNT about how the series would proceed.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic episodes such as the South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, the lawyer Ben Hagman, in 1931.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the theatrical scenes in New York and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall, Tales, about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or hurt someone," he told the Prensa Associado news agency at the time.
After a liver transplant, he turned to promoting organ donation and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to help with timed patients.
"I advise them, to encourage me to give them, to meet with them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a comfort in the sense of 'don't worry, it's going to be a little awkward for a while, but you'll be healthy'.
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
The course begins, examining the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When the professor of religion, Stuart Charme, decided to take a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Maya calendar, due to come on December 21, many people seized as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was coming to him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call the "debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict that Israel is drawn to, a place in which the Apocalypse will begin, according to the theorists of the end of the world.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester he's ever been," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember, the bad means good for the apocalyptically-minded.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, the assistant professor at the University of Temple is hosting a "Meding, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas expand with time," he says, and as they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students of what is possible, probable, believable and impossible," Vacker says.
The main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of arts and anthropology, were brought together to hold a course with the simple title The End of the World.
"We don't connect "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing a course again if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "savaging destruction," students must study, create projects and take final exams.
The Penn State's final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the evening of the expected end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become rather popular.
"He started in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-rise students, who were signed up to 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we e-mail asked if there was still room.
Students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," 23-year-old Bridgidid Robinson, a student at the University of Rutgers at Camden, said at the University of Rutgers in Camden, Robinson, a religious and sociology student at Haddonfield.
And so, apocalyptic, mundane, or religious sentiments is merely a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said he believed he was on the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prediction and we will refute it in some way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at West Chester University of Temple.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, reaching back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The flowering of this speculation was caused by the internet.
"Onnow people don't think about it," he said.
This is happening in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, when asked if he knew about any "end of the world" course there, he answered quickly.
"The Philippines are not attended by the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the exception of the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Realt noted that there had been talk of many days of the last trial over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "the people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the start of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will be extinct.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors alike.
Several said they intended to go to the "end of the world" festivities.
"I'm probably going to call some of my friends to laugh together," explained Samir Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
