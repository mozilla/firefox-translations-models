Economia and Centrum connect management.
For example, they will offer joint advertising
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague's Karlín district.
Economia has taken another step in transforming the Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and Centrum have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishers into a common media house," says Kamil Čermák, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economia and Managing Director, commenting on the changes.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by Centrum Holdings Executive Director Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil has been appointed as the new joint sales director, and Zuzana Tylčerová, the advertising director of both companies, is also subordinate to him.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint editorial director is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pittsová was entrusted with the newly established position of Marketing Director.
The independent Corporate Communications Department is now headed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, human resources management for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better interconnect the content creation of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into an agreement to acquire Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Centrum Holdings' portfolio consists of Aktuálně.cz servers, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz brands, and the Najisto SMB agency, and a portfolio of nearly twenty smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the IHNED.cz news server, the weekly magazines Respekt and Ekonom, and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Prague's Karlín district.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was supposed to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press widely reported on the explosion at the alleged rocket depot, but the attack on it was not confirmed by the Israeli government.
An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the airstrike when asked by CNN.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli airstrike, according to a U.S. government source, were rockets and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The Associated Press, citing another U.S. security official, reported that Russian SA-125 missiles were the target of an Israeli airstrike on a target on Syrian territory.
A second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to the DPA news agency.
In addition, they reportedly showed a battery of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with a radar to track missiles and their targets.
The missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms, according to an Israeli television report.
Israel has reportedly bombed rocket shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly said it will hit any arms shipment to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted a return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview marking the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since stepping down in June 2007 after a decade in leadership, Mr Blair has largely avoided talking about British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, the London Evening Standard quoted his reply as follows: "Yes, of course, but that's hardly going to happen, is it, so..."
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport over shooting
There was shooting at Los Angeles International Airport in the morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, reportedly in Terminal Three.
Reuters, citing California media, said lawmen shot and killed an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, reported that there was a shootout in which two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration were injured.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with a larger number of injured.
Berdych and Štěpánek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
For the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil nominated the quartet of Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives are defending the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the finals for the third time in the last five years.
"We know that we are going on hot ground, that it will be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the large planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sink into new comfortable seats and a projection screen with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz has been added above their heads.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"These are twenty-one computers that generate images," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from multiple projectors does not overlap, but gives a coherent impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician from the observatory.
The digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the ocean floor.
Viewers will find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen purchased programs and their own work in the hall.
From Saturday, there are two programs on the program.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about astronaut training, fly into space, spin on centrifuges, and then see the challenging conditions astronauts face in space.
The second show is for children and is called Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a reef whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was mainly paid by the Ministry of Education.
Smaller amounts were also contributed by the city of Brno and the observatory from their budget.
The projection screen cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed by audiovisual equipment and computers," Dusek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to director Dušek, 25,000 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care bill
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that an individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a fine – does not contravene the Constitution under government tax power.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining parts of the 2700-page law and further ruled that a statutory health care requirement that directs states to expand the ability to obtain health insurance or risk losing all federal funding for health insurance is not coercive and inconsistent with the Constitution.
Lawsuits to block the law were filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primaries, the bill was vehemently opposed by every major Republican candidate, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.
Naďa Konvalinková in the role of the innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub keeper and she was very good at it.
Perhaps the popular Czech actress was planning to change her profession and start her business in a pub?
Naďa Konvalinková appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and drew beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was able to do it right away.
My boss even offered to hire me so I could make a living from draught beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I've been doing to this day, acting," Konvalinka, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub, revealed with a smile.
"I like Irish beer and sometimes I have Irish whiskey," the actress revealed her tastes.
Nadi long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I am dead, and in my present new life I must not drink.
I'm allowed one beer or one shot a day, and I try to stick to that," the actor added.
Egypt inaugurates the first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has been sworn in as an inaugural office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to end with political unrest in Egypt.
Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
At his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mansion built overlooking the Nile that resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a sixty-year-old US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by governments for most of the 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small motorcade, hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and contrary to the presidential pomp of the Mubarak era, traffic was only briefly halted to allow the motorcade to pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, derisively described as the Muslim Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tire," has soared since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also as a candidate for all those who want to see the revolt against the authoritarian Mubarak through to an end.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue formal suit and red tie, told judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to deliver his inaugural address.
While standing at attention, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
Present was the military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was accompanied by chants of "the army and the people are one hand" from hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
Cairo University was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 70s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers taken from office by the military council that had taken them from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath in court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he submitted to the will of the military, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the fancy center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedneck would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves."
Slowly they wander the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what their beliefs are, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their tastes are.
And from the state of the graves, they will also find out how the survivors take care of their dead.
Halloween 2013: By the numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a scrooge.
For two years, there has been no candy in my apartment, and this year will probably be no different.
However, statistics show that I am the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans — 158 million of them, in fact — will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween are trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year, the latest fad in fashion are sexy inanimate objects.
It's not just women who have to be sexy anymore; Foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies thanks to the parade of the dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there is nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So a lot of funny doggies will be seen.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets, and Clark bars.
That's amazing news for the 41 million carolers who are about to raid our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, on Halloween we buy, believe it or not, consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet nearly 16,000 tons of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Candy Shop Association.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
This is a mystery I have never solved.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best titles, like "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are 1200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that make a profit of $500 million according to American Haunted Houses, and that includes those amazing scared photos that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't remove them, and the person you like looks at the photo and comments like "you look nice."
And finally, a little about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "baby in pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving gourds instead of sitting in them.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California and try to cut up their pumpkin weighing almost one ton.
How insectoids from Thailand boosted sales of a Parisian bar
Maybe you scoff at insects and do not know that you eat about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is organic, nutritious and a unique experience is also taken care of.
The insect menu was first included in Paris on the menu of his business at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs' book The Naked Lunch, can be found in the trendy 18th district near Montmartre, frequented by tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now bite not only various larvae, grasshoppers or water beetles, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged vans (so as not to damage the insects' wings, twist their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to the Davirons all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a pioneering Parisian bar has a few reasons to eat insects.
The first is the environmental benefits, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, simply aiming to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant is the pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be excited about the idea of eating a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reaction of the customers of the Parisian bar to the insects served is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and then choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands CHANGES YOUR MOOD.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an impossible problem.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed its hands after the failure seemed much more optimistic than the one where the participants did not wash their hands.
The "hands washed" group also performed better than the other in the next test.
Still, those who washed their hands performed worse on subsequent tests than those who didn't.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not experience any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical cleanliness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, motivation decreases, the testers have to concentrate much more in the next exams.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs do not wash their hands, but after traveling by public transport it is already a fifth.
They also usually stick to hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Caressing a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash their hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I am afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better," dermatologist Klaudie Komárková commented on the results of the survey.
A drug smuggling tunnel between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad has been found
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railroad.
U.S. authorities have described the one-by-one-meter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds its way to the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is full of vague warehouses where trucks can easily be hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be delivered undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute them.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are breaking into extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses the problem of drug cartels to get their products to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 650-meter-long corridor equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Are the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what changes British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, asking leading UK business leaders about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than embroiled in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe's mysterious institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these core competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, with entrepreneurs saying that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European business area – even 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreed.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling insight, which is that a clear majority wants Britain to seek treaty change and a relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, shared by businesses of all sizes and major business groups, suggest that the business sector is pushing for "meaningful change" that will shift influence back to Britain.
The stakes are high – achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% in a referendum vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to amend the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and, as the eurozone embarks on its way to closer economic and fiscal union, increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority and, as our survey results show, this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach for business.

The UK government has announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as the first phase launches in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "thrilled" to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of Phase Two, the service will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which held talks with the national transport authority Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to explore additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London equivalent to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our target for HS2 is really a national network that better connects the UK and its cities."
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without this, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it's also about connectivity – across the UK, HS2 will better connect 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scotland's integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "A high-speed line has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland in the overall high-speed rail case across Britain."
We are therefore keen to work with the UK Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to benefit everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning to do anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with British ministers over the next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines to Charge Hand Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for carry-on baggage on board flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although they said in an announcement Wednesday that passengers would be allowed to keep the entire can.
The new carry-on baggage charge applies to baggage in the upper storage compartment, so small bags under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers wait until arriving at the gate to pay.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the hundred-dollar fee was meant to encourage passengers to pay in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
Airlines started charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed as much as they could into hand luggage hidden in the storage compartment, so there was often no space in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
Ms O'Malley said the new fee was really not intended to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it very clear that finding space in the top storage compartment is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger queuing at Frontier's gate can bring baggage for which they pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same baggage.
Ms O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures would be modified to ensure passengers were aware of the charge before they arrived at the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on baggage fee won't take effect until the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the extra baggage fee as a sign that airlines are struggling to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
However, most did not touch the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only airline that also has such charges is Hungary's Wizz Air, says air travel consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, it estimated that Spirit's carry-on baggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on baggage fee.
"Getting on a plane was the smoothest I've ever seen in my flying career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and arguments at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and boarding was instantaneous."
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit's lead.
Frontier said passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire can and coffee will be replenished for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but backed down seven months later after passenger complaints and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand baggage if passengers don't buy a flight directly from the airline is its last effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel retailers like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly from them, instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
But Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who made purchases through an online travel agency just half of its frequent flyer miles.
On Wednesday, it trimmed the reward for miles flown to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
So a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to select their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and it's losing money.
According to financial results reported Wednesday by corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell 9 percent and transport capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling the airline, Republic is also trying to solve Frontier's financial problems.
We studied 11 THOUSAND ADS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis detected over 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4300 were published in the daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore becoming the most important medium for posting job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was first conducted, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it stabilized at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, job advertisements largely reflect the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in the period of economic prosperity and in the time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 advertisements were published in the same reporting period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented to a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including blue-collar professions, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies for both media.
On the Internet, advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts took a prominent place.
Positions of programmers or small business leaders were only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, while a large representation belongs mainly to service and manual professions.
One of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through advertising offers is, of course, education.
Other monitored areas included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was mentioned in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of the advertisements did employers require active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in daily newspapers in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Experience requirements are generally associated with skilled professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
In blue-collar professions, these are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, added the author of the study, Jiří Tillner.
Employers also indicate requirements for the qualities and skills of potential candidates in half of their advertisements.
Communication skills have long appeared as the most frequently required skills in advertising.
Furthermore, employers require flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres face low footfall
These are the results of data from Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre opens to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be Prague's 19th shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large centre compared to the locality and poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead spots in the centres," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Sylvie Samadi, head of retail at Jones Lang LaSalle, about a fifth of shopping centres face low footfall.
The main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in the given location.
Some projects opened almost fully booked, but their results were mainly disappointing at the beginning.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centres must do more to 'attract' their customers with new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, even rising in some centres, because landlords were willing to reduce rents and rent some units in the crisis.
"However, it is true that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
According to Sylvie Samadi, shopping centres opened in the past two years have been slow to break through on the market.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on shopping and everyday services for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also room for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague, he sees space for the upcoming shopping center on Vítězné Square, and Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square have clear potential.
"The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, which allow retailers to cover and expand to smaller and smaller towns at favorable rents and operating costs, there is also space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres located in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of gross leasable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres by number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In terms of the number of retail parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values of Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags behind by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
The parents of a Georgia teenage boy who died in a freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenage boy whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling ghost in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found tucked up in a straightened ghost behind the stands of the gymnasium of the high school where he attended on Jan. 11.
Lowndes County Sheriff's Investigators have concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the seventeen-year-old's family denies it.
"They are unequivocally convinced that their son was murdered FoxNews.com," said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff had said.
"They believe it defies logic, the laws of physics and also common sense," Crump said.
They believe this is to cover up what really happened in order to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
A second autopsy, however, gave a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are several question marks that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in the Johnson death case to warrant an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he will ask the FBI to carry it out.
A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to turn over all surveillance camera videos viewed by investigators.
The teenager's parents hope the videos will contain clues to reveal how their son died.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.
This reveal is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's top aides held intensive group meetings and polls in late 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading re-election hopes.
According to Times national policy correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, notably former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the election of former Secretary of State Clinton's move to vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chairman Jim Messina, and former White House top advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was being considered.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was in the lead in replacing Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would "not substantially increase Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've researched a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we thought, "Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley described the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made considerable investment to see if the move would pay off in the election.
"Campaigns don't spend that much money on elections and qualitative research unless something is really seriously considered," Martin told AC360.
But it's unclear whether Obama knew his team was considering the swap.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential shuffle.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was "aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not definitively answer the question of whether the political probe has reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the research surrounding the removal of Biden from the list.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Not so, Mr. Hašek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to exert such pressure so that Martin Hašek is stripped of all political functions and leaves his parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already minuscule.
Martin Hašek backs himself up with the promise he made, but everyone, and especially politicians, must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr Babiš also has material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
Even the best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics one does not apologize, in politics one resigns.
Mr. Hašek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, unless you have lied - here you can see how difficult it is with lying), you will leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as the expression of the man who made a mistake and bears responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, albeit fallible, person or a lifelong skeleton.
It may seem unfair to you that I address only you, but you are the leader and they are misguided sheep.
And you are a leader and always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to lower your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit out the disgrace and then attack again, but that is how guerrillas or crooks behave.
You are, I repeat, a leader in your eyes, an alpha male, so act like it.
Take responsibility and walk out of politics.
Black box in your car?
While American road planners struggle to find money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that fits easily into your car's dashboard.
The devices that track every mile a motorist travels and transmit that information to authorities are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning agencies to overhaul America's outdated highway funding system.
The usually drab design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to be able to use these little boxes to record mileage and maybe even where you're going — and then use that information to compile a tax bill.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to continue, some states aren't waiting.
They are looking at how over the next decade they can move to a system in which the driver pays per kilometre of road he is on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"It's not a matter where we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to begin tracking the mileage of every California motorist for the state in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is what this technology is for.
The impetus is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations, is at rock bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes by even one cent.
"A gasoline tax just isn't sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed tracking devices in 500 cars to test this pay-per-mile system.
"In the long run, this seems like the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on mileage.
It's no surprise that urban liberals like the idea, as taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which can help reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planners are looking to this system to plan strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania representative), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market leaders at the Reason Foundation are also sympathetic to the idea of drivers paying for miles driven.
"It's not a tax that's going to disappear into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they receive.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who in 2011 urged Congress to move toward paying per mile.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would include about 10,000 cars.
But the House leadership rejected the proposal, amid concerns from rural lawmakers representing sections of the population whose daily lives often mean miles to work outside the city.
Still, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most zealous is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying mileage tax to the state instead of gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot.
New York is currently exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do this in a limited way for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state departments of transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement the change.
However, this concept does not only have supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother tracking and things like that were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project progressed, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website, "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to the recording of individuals' daily departures and arrivals.
Nevada is among the few states trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car drives, but not exactly when or where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
The company was not originally involved in the operation to help the government tax drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging third-party insurance market, where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But the device they are testing attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only supplies a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go for it if you don't track their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have been made in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the state's residents.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will embrace the concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that would be equipped to additionally pay parking meter charges, to provide mileage insurance, and to collect speed data for other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits they are offered," the city's projection document states.
However, some transport planners would like to know whether all the talk of paying per kilometre is just a giant proxy problem.
Officials at the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Committee on Transportation say Congress could very easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrids or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when it's enough to take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy O2.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and, according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, there is already a hand in the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction should come in November, probably before the start of the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG Group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, the company embarked on an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to everyone's surprise, until then the company's desire to penetrate telecommunications had not been discussed.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunications engineer, Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing head of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and most recently headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she has admitted that she wants to launch a virtual one at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like this under normal circumstances, but according to information from Hospodářské noviny, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will share their networks completely.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer, it can auction a specially designated spectrum), Vodafone does not have to enter the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka in its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network on the 900 MHz frequency), which will allow the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building a costly LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the money saved on a fixed internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
By buying the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is a daughter of the Czech one), it would immediately get a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big juggernaut that will await restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would acquire the LTE networks for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the large sums that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September to protest planned Arctic oil drilling have been flown from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original piracy charges against its activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil rig in the Arctic have been transferred from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA agency, it was a planned transfer.
Authorities initially accused the environmentalists of piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week they announced they would replace the charges with more lenient hooliganism, punishable by a reduced sentence of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement today that the piracy allegations have not yet been dropped by the authorities as promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two crimes.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace the piracy charge with hooliganism charges.
But when thirty prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against everyone," AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
In mid-September, the Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at a Gazprom oil rig.
The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they appealed, but the court rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of detention.
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St Petersburg would make it easier for detainees to meet with their families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they could be worse," he warned.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned mafioso about police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, was said to have passed information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed a drug mafioso of a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, is alleged to have passed sensitive information to underworld boss Neil Scarbrough about an investigation into his drug smuggling activities after he became suspected of using cocaine.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by criminals as the best solicitor, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was having dinner with colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards, investigations revealed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
Over a period of eight months, between January and August 2011, he tried to surreptitiously obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were being followed at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized heroin and cocaine worth around GBP 1.5 million in cash, along with £200 000 in cash, during a series of raids, 32 others ended up in prison with them.
Ditta, 42, passed information to criminals for fear of being found out for his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, had a shameful time at Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of obstructing justice on two counts after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after a police inquiry into Scarborough discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditto's home, and saw him placing drugs 60 percent pure under the lawyer's black golf gloved basket.
Subsequently, Scarborough was in a regular telephone conversation with Ditta, who was having dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and nine conversations took place between the two persons.
The court heard that traces of the Class A drug were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, saying he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take several credit cards out of it, but they were all seized and hair samples were taken.
Under police questioning, he said that he ran an office both at his home address and at his workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who better to know that they must not break the law than a criminal lawyer."
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a solicitor and of coming into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring his profession a good reputation, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied wrongdoing, saying: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
Following the hearing, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta went from criminal solicitor to criminal himself when he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups tasked with gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and should inspire confidence and a sense of reliance in the public.
Mr Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit conducted an investigation against Mr Ditto, which also convicted him of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other traffickers were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row block in America, he would like Mohammed Ali as a dinner guest and he cited inequality as his motivation for the work.
Obama backs away from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated and ambitious promise that "if you like your health care program, you can keep it."
Citing hundreds of thousands of notices of dismissals from providers, Republicans have accused the president in recent days of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama backtracked on his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called the "media hype" about the testimonies, Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek out new insurance policies on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same cost or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
"I say this frankly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said in testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace had gone "poorly" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
An irritated Sebelius uttered the sentence, which was picked up by a microphone on, yesterday to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee meeting, which followed a heated exchange with Missouri Rep. Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, over whether she herself needed to participate in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing, he repeatedly teased Sebelius about why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance and purchase the HealthCare.gov program he is now imposing on millions of Americans.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 leading candidates for CNN's 2013 Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year Awards, you can vote for him or any of the ten other leading candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again, driving to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car crash near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital, in 1981.
At first, he was treated only for a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, creating a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be the first there, but you are not the first.
There are many patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if Cameroonians could visit a doctor, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of health care spending in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
With poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 surgeries for free last year.
He himself became a physician vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram into vans, attach medical supplies to roofs and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once the vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like true heroes: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his broad smile and unbridled energy – is more than happy to join in the local merriment.
The next day, the team begins treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each trip," says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document required by the school, but which many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually done in the school building, at the town hall or at home; After the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for the next patient.
Using light from the generator, the operating room and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
The group – made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 surgeries for free last year and realise that their help can mean a lot to the locals.
One man said he would be able to work again after hernia surgery.
"This will change the future of our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, she also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says it is this second work that funds about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering for Bwelle's group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We would wash Dr. Bwelle's hands thoroughly and remove blood stains or hold instruments for him," O'Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in America, you will never experience that.
Student volunteers usually pay for travel to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, Bwelle provides food, transportation, and study.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant toil is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that's why I do it.

Central banks will keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral arrangements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks said in a joint statement.
"This is a very sensible move," said Julian Callow, chief international economist at London-based Barclays.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so I think this is no surprise," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the bonds that began to form in 2007, when the international credit market first faltered.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers' decision comes as the U.S. Fed prepares to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could drive up the price of money in the global market.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while at the same time excess liquidity of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a borrowing of another.
The ECB launches a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
EU agrees on banking supervision, ECB to supervise 150 banks.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded one thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, there were 212 infections, a record number.
"In my opinion, there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on AIDS who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, last year from January to September there were 165 more HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of follow-up to the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 infected people resided.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region and 116 from the Ústí nad Labem Region.
The least infected came from the Highlands, 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected through blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not occurred in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. for more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, transmitted to them from their mother.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "models for a way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that "brute force cannot equal clever cunning," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myth would be "too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in school," said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that myths and folk art are already part of education," he said.
I have defended this plan for twenty years.
He added that "openly instructive" authors and teachers are like a "switch" for engaging stories with a "subliminal" message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and who also writes the Penguin Book and the British National Tales, says, "You may have good intentions, but you're better off keeping them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly stated.
The old truth that it is better to show than to describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not used to yet.
First, she put aside her smile, the one she kept showing off as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
This relieved her because it was a mask she had decided not to take off in public.
He was honest at home only on days when she was grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Adík around her.
And, of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless courses of business skills.
Now they finally really came in handy.
So as not to grieve those closest to her.
Then he flew into a corner.
As a disguise on a masquerade.
November, or any other month, can't make her smile like when they were on a trip with someone who hadn't been here for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make the Cartier style develop as a living language

GM Recalls Some New Light Trucks in U.S. to Repair Seat Backrests
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a manual backrest tilt defect, according to Friday's announcement from the U.S. automotive safety authority.
In some of these vehicles, the front seat tilting mechanism may have a defect.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that "if a car is hit from behind, the headrest may not properly protect the occupants, increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the van in June, and for the leading U.S. automaker, this is the most important vehicle launch since restructuring following bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the van about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review notices to owners because of a 16-day government shutdown that weakened auto sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra vans, which were redesigned for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierras from its vans.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Overly inquisitive newspapers to be investigated
A Chinese newspaper that called on its front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to fabricate stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The trustee said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction".
The order to "rectify" came from the State Administration of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong province.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the Yangcheng-based Evening News newspaper New Express published several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disorganized," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revocation of his journalistic license."
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to carry out a comprehensive correction of the New Express and recommended that they investigate the relevant persons responsible at the New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper ran two front page demands for his release, claiming to be behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to publishing false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realize that I have acted wrongly.
Following Mr Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology saying he had failed to adequately check his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects have made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, despite a change in the law this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
At a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it," says Ms Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2400 ($3000 SGD) every month as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is inadequate, she says.
Indeed, demand across Southeast Asian regions – where household debt is rising – is such that ValueMax, where a woman makes her transaction, became the third pawnshop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pawning jewellery is not only a quick way to borrow cash – SGD1300 in the case of Ms Amirthalinga – but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income, and can make a loan faster than banks.
And so, as families feel the pressure from the rising cost of living and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with a deteriorating financial situation.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia tops the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that as costs rise, people from the middle to the low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people hastily pawning their personal belongings and taking the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items pledged at the city's 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, we'll pawn Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month."
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawn industry is so great that ValueMax, operator of a branch in the Bendemeer centre and 15 similar ones in Singapore, plans to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO yes Lee Ching.
The company will fund this by using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. yes says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn't directly increase debt.
"Customers are pawning items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn't increase household debt," he says.
In society, pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, it is not only people in financial distress who use pawnshops.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, and can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come from all possible backgrounds.
"These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow for the short term because of their bold deals or investments, or small businesses that need help resolving their cash flow issues," says Ms. yes.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
The NSA blames the crash not on hackers, but on an "internal error."
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that its website went down for several hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacker attack as some claimed online.
"The site NSA.gov not be accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be fixed later tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners recorded that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal sensitive networks were "not compromised at all."
The spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for the shutdown of the NSA site through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until the servers become overloaded and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple, and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA agency, once dubbed "No such agency," has in recent months, after a string of foreign and domestic surveillance programs have become the focus of public attention and the target of biting criticism as a result of the theft of secret NSA files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of HIV infections in Prague has exceeded one thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed infection in a total of 1,005 people from the capital.
This is according to the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the National Institute of Public Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infected people in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 immunodeficiency disease, the disease has already started.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009, investigations revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 180.
Two years ago, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the laboratory, there were 212.
"In my opinion, there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on AIDS who has led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests revealed infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavaty said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three female patients.
From the beginning of follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS broke out in 161 men and 37 women.
Most of the infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this Country: Presidents on the Verge of Strength
It is almost a rule that at key moments in a country, the head of state was not in such shape to fulfill his duties as statesman.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term and the events around Munich would have played out a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly across the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London at once and not fight hard for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation would not have a hangover from that capitulation to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and during Munich he was still in shape, but during the war things started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
Being a little better off, he could have gone into exile a third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It is a pity to talk about Hácha.
They elected him on the grounds that "the president will not be in a position to make decisions."
But he had to, even though it was probably not a big decision with a knife to Hitler's neck in the chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, the head of the intelligence service, František Moravec, said what should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly about the day, would not go so smoothly and with such profit for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, both believing him and fearing him.
A human wreck, Gottwald had his aged comrades executed, as Moscow had ordered.
Ludvík Svoboda definitively prevented himself by participating in normalization and they had to depose him, already completely senile.
The fact that Husák was a helpless and ill, depressed old man made the events in November 89 easier, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky that his last years did not meet him in office, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his achievements suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the Republic now.
Or maybe it's imminent, it's just not visible.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (from a historical point of view) a good thing that the president is not fully in power.
But this is not normal.
Couldn't we elect someone acceptable and acceptably healthy as president in this country once again?

Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last ones, he said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz that there is no other way out and that any government that emerges from last Friday's and Saturday's vote is an impossible patchwork.
"It cannot last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the lifetime of the beginning election period to be up to two years.
He disagrees with the objection that voters will hardly make a completely different choice next time: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as it did this year (compared to 2010, it lost about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that early elections will take place, it will strengthen Andrej Babiš's ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Schwarzenberg comments on the turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where chairman Bohuslav Sobotka declared after a secret meeting of part of the party leadership in Lany that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democrats:
"Leading officials of the Democratic Party like little boys go to the head of state to allow them to coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and more intelligent."
"Because I have never seen something so eagerly done stupidly in my life," added the chairman of TOP 09.
And to President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over the party."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the Chamber of Deputies, including Farský's register of contracts, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but fell under the table with the early elections.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, the chairman of TOP 09 claims that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, ANO election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of "stealing" the ANO movement's program by introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of its lead - it has simply dusted off a proposal that was about to enter the second reading in the Chamber of Deputies.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check the tip
Former News of the world (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" methods to confirm a fraudulent tip about a love affair involving then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that the News of the World newspaper picked up false reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and invade her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecutor is suggesting that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not a man who stands outside his house hoping to catch people outside, but a person who likes to foist stories on people to see what they have to say," Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of researching stories: hacking into a phone, following and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the other, he has to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into his phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
Rumours of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's reporting unit when a source sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: "You're just wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found recordings on the private investigator's computer where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
While Ms Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, in which he said, "I got a story that we're going to release tomorrow that I'd love to talk to Charles about."
Mr Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as other high-profile figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about his love affair with a married woman while he was seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking into their phones.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could argue that the city of New York is the place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as a ceremony chairman at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the assembled people by the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Solo Comedy institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become successful to the point that they are too big to be played in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual musical-comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
Just as this festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows on smaller radio and television networks such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has made his spin with his sitcom (the hilariously spicy "League" on a fantastic-football-themed FXX theme) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but is best known for the fast-paced "Marcel the shell with shoes on" video series.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the acerbic and racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
Many things have moved, and they are different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman Štěch stirred up discord.
Governor Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the Presidium, and he confirmed it.
Chairman Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the ČSSD's misery.
The other gentlemen showed mainly their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek has made himself most distracted by an interview on television.
Based on this, I see no better option than for the ČSSD to nominate Senate Vice-President Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one who would not have an initial handicap and I think she would do a standard job.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with a mere blessing from Chairman Babiš and without the People's Party, but with the Christian Democrats' Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a believing Social Democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability, because it would push for a proper referendum law, and Úsvit chairman Okamura has pledged to support it.
Chairman Babiš would eventually reconcile with the progress of taxes, because he is bright and will see that it is not possible without it.
The Christian Democrats would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in the government.
The same is true of YES, there would be a valuable minister, but if they sensibly do not want to enter into a risky government participation, but provide support, also fine.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
The arrest of Bárta is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of the wiretaps?
Public Affairs chairman Vít Bárta was arrested by police on Thursday.
Together with him, the head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics of the Anti-Corruption Police, Jan Petržílek, was detained.
The detention is related to wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps that the Novinky.cz server came up with was confirmed to the Czech News Agency by a reliable source.
Intercepted telephone conversations between Janoušek and Bém, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes and in which the two men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Hummingbird", show Janoušek's influence on the town's steps under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper said at the time that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was owned by Bárta at that time.
News server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained detective Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek joined the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretapping, at the same time that they were made public.
"With regard to the Act on the Protection of Classified Information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also declined to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The inspectorate does not want to comment on the case for the same reason.
He and Vít Bárta also detained an officer of the anti-corruption police
Bárta's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV deputies, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent my client in this matter as well, but due to the protection of classified information, I cannot comment further."
According to Pravo, the case is being handled by the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS).
News server tn.cz reported that Bárta may have been buying classified information from the police.
According to the prvnizpravy.cz server, the case could be related to the case of former Police President Petr Lessy, whose appointment Bárta allegedly sought.
However, Pravo's latest information shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Police Presidium spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment on the matter, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Právo on Friday.
It is the local prosecutor who supervises Bárta's case, and it is therefore indirectly clear from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in a secret regime.
A reporter from Novinek managed to reach Vít Bárta's wife, Kateřina Klasnová, in the morning in front of their home in Prague's Klárov district.
She was just loading her suitcases into the car and driving away.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Úsvit movement, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bárta's detention.
According to his words, he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list, and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the last early elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribing MPs from Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months suspended for 30 months.
Eventually, the verdict was changed and Bárta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mozambique's security are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under a statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she swapped her company clothing for a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "we demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize that country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that open conflict is unlikely to erupt again in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could generate more than $50 billion in investment by companies like Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni, and America's Anadarko over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo party claims that the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
Violent attacks on former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces stormed a Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflicts, saying it attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to assuage fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told France's AFP news agency on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns were heightened when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the two sides have done little to ease tensions between the parties, fueled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It's a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been pushing for electoral changes, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a moribund movement to extract benefits and financial gains from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but it has carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south road.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometers from the capital, Maputo, but where the city of Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Medicoop, and many are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one who finds the solution to the problems," he says.
Protester Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the state committee for the supervision of corruption.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the coastal leasing policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Committee Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its probe into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, renewed without having to take part in a tender when it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interests in the properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public tenders.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay, which brought in $2.5 million a year to the Obeids, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Oboid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, had urged a shift in the government's leasing policy.
A transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Messrs. Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ports Department after working under Mr. Obeid in the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the development of commercial leasing policy the subject of conversations during these phone calls?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy of Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this one.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.

The dog rolled up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the Lány chateau.
What state of health is he in?
Cabbage is bubbling in Kunovice, they don't add chemicals to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut want to produce in the coming months in Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hame food group.
The season here started in October and will last about half a year.
Since 1925, healthy delicacy has been produced here in the traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our employees walk almost ten kilometers per shift.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
Cabbage heads are transported to the company premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from the Ostrožsko and Břeclav regions.
Fruta employees then clean the vegetables, remove the stalks and throw them into the twister.
From there, the already chopped cabbage falls into six-metre-deep pools, where pedallers dressed in white clothes and boots work tirelessly.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with a tarpaulin and weighed down with water.
"Cabbage crumbs then mature for six to eight weeks under spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of substances supporting fermentation," emphasized director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweet and sour brine in sachets or jars and subjected to sterilisation.
Hame supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest in it is also registered in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Damkova is said to prohibit UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing penalties for referees.
It is forbidden to do so by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview for the daily Právo.
Otherwise, the FACR would face sanctions.
Damková also denied that she would side with the footballers of Pilsen, where she comes from.
This speculation is really nonsensical.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1: 6, "said Damková in response to the criticism that has raged after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although in recent months the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees, Damková assures that judges pay for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds that the referee made a mistake, it will restrict his delegation, no matter what match it was," Damková said.
The reason why the penalties are not published, according to Damková, is the ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes breaches."
"We are very suspicious and we look for something behind every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be severe sanctions," Damková said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the publication continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And those are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of referees," Damková added.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The tour operator now expects its annual underlying pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current trend is maintained, this will represent a twelve to seventeen percent increase from the record profit of USD 290.4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and started the second half with explosive growth, particularly in Australian and UK off-business travel.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
The recreational business in Australia rebounded during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the holiday sector, while corporate clients spent less.
U.S. business recovered from a loss during a seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to deliver a third consecutive full-year gain.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to seek asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had served an "extradition notice" on the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station and failing to do so could face arrest.
Assange exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition and he faces extradition to Sweden on sex crime charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard "served an extradition notice on a 40-year-old man asking him to appear at the police station on the date and time allotted to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he could face espionage charges because he published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court ruled: Nečas can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the other hand, it ruled that they cannot be punished for possible crimes until they resigned from their parliamentary mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
By this decision, the court rejected the motion of state prosecutor Ivo Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings against the deputies.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies in return for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be further prosecuted.
Aircraft manufacturers dispute seat width, big orders at stake
A dispute has flared up among leading planemakers over the width of second-class seats for long-haul flights, triggering a bitter exchange at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The issue at issue is the width of seats provided for long-haul flights for economy class – not exactly the kind airlines would normally go by, but whose space allocation is key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46-centimetre-wide economy class seats, but U.S. rival Boeing says that should be decided by airlines.
The controversy arose as aircraft manufacturers compete to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with a potential record number of orders expected during the Nov. 17-21 event.
The way the rear of the aircraft is laid out – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of the economic performance requirements for the design of new "mini-jumbo" aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded "777X" model will carry 406 people in economy seats more than 43cm wide, spaced out 10 in each row.
Airbus says a rival version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46-centimetre-wide economy seats spread out over 9 cm.
Giant airplanes often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in the professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to gain supremacy with more than 100 orders.
He recently gave a preliminary glimpse of what could be starting a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture showing three people crammed into a restaurant with the caption "Would you like it?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than those of regional turboprops," said John Leahy, head of Airbus sales.
As eating habits change, people are bigger, but airplane seats haven't changed radically.
From the early '70s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul aviation, to the turn of the century, the weight of the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
According to American medical statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to the seat concept of the '50s, when the average seat width of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research suggesting that widening the seat by 2.5cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the size of Airbus' seats, saying it is not within the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just seat width.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful," said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, more elbow room is essential, but for suppliers, this is a growing issue that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute is a race to aircraft orders, with estimated business worth at least $700 billion in list prices over the next few decades, enough to tip the scales of US and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the seating layout is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 percent better efficient than market leader Boeing 777-300ER, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER, in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs.
Boeing's performance requirements depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weaker compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram more seats and make its planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that 10-seat cabins in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are in favor of a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"A forty-five-centimetre-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers so they can choose.
Traveling aircraft dealers even carry a tape of measurement to check the competing arrangement.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a high-density layout for low-cost airlines and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a major modification of the cabin by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other maker of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will go unheeded, but it may deter a wave of 777X sales.
CME will target the TV business.
It will lay off almost a quarter of people.
The CME media group will be laying off workers.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down by a thousand people.
He intends to cut back on all side activities and focus only on his core business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV number one TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really cannot comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, Nova's communications director.
According to information from MF DNES, significant layoffs will certainly not be avoided in the Czech Republic, but it should have by far the greatest impact on the staffing levels of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new Nova bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who succeeded longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that they want to limit all activities not directly related to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel's patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents at the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it overbid in an auction in Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps match search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which is at the core of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be reached immediately.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which competes heavily with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its bid several times and eventually offered as much as $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the battle for Nortel's patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patent pool.
"Despite its failure to auction the patents at issue, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents," the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, according to it, Google's patent infringement is intentional, as the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that a condition for an independent Scotland's membership in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport control at Berwick and the barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
It is true that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – predictably – this did not make headlines.
Nobody has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws when it suits them.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, offering continued discord would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that it became an excavation. I heard the journalistic canard that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting idea hidden in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to obey Europe at all?
Why swap the London chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is the real European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to opposing the EU or abolishing the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the euroskeptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came out of nowhere and captured nearly five million votes in September's federal election, effectively "sweeping" the Free Democrats (the equivalent of Britain's Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
At home, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket put on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running large budget deficits – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that locks its members into exchange rates favorable to German exporters – something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage compared to Germany in terms of domestic production.
The only help is to cut revenues and public spending – as Germany is urging to do.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies the deeper cause of Europe's languid performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy promoted by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the consumer's expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
All the world's wage freezes would not avert trampling Europe's petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smouldering rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would rein in Germany and allow Paris to put itself on a par with Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a token of political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's worn-out economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-EU National Front, has just won a major by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that splits on the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-EU parties do well in this election, as is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
It occurs to me that in the foreseeable future the growing anti-European feeling and anti-common currency will come together and kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but will rather transform itself into something looser in the sense of the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and align itself with the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (basically) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the ability to tell Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in Europe's loose arrangement, provided it retained its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, winning by a large majority in 2011 thanks to an opposition to austerity planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to accept austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate gender"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with an ambiguous genital system.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to specify any gender for such children and allows them to list their gender as "indefinite" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to make a hasty decision to have sex assignment surgery on their child and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person said many years later, "I am neither male nor female."
I will remain a patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year, out of 2,000 children, one is born who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, rather than waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender assignment issues, said the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersex children present an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but for most children that's not the case," he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery, and then one can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowledge of how a child develops gender is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as distinct from transgender or transgender people because their status is not linked to sex but to their biological make-up, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and physique, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital tract, or in chromosome structure and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the work field, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not correspond to any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify male, female or "third gender" in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her "indeterminate" gender status for the rest of her life.
According to the Interior Ministry, in addition to M (male) and F (female), German passports will also have a third designation, X, for intersex people.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a France 24 news report.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the heavily Catholic country signed a petition calling for the "gender theory" to be removed from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also took a stand against the German law, writing: "As the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization upside down."
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would prefer to see babies assigned a gender at birth.
"Parenting itself is stressful even without any restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told a parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children of both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek who had two sexes.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, saying that gender is a complex issue and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up given their gender.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you did not call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
A persistent theory about how to treat children with ambiguous gender was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender is malleable.
He coined the new concept of "gender," arguing that social and environmental causes—how parents raised their child—acted on the child's genes and hormones to shape the child, regardless of whether he or she was identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theory became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged by a poorly performed circumcision to have their child completely castrated, his testicles removed and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15, he had surgery back into a boy and married a woman.
However, at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "use this model" to this day.
But in the 90s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared "dissatisfied with the result".
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous genitals.
Doctors weren't sure if he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life."
Shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent for vaginal surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with Sex Development Disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone for its reproductive system to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, took doses of testosterone and had his bust removed,
Operations caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for informed choice, worries that the German law "calls for branding and stigma."
"Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose the 'indefinite' for the child," she said.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
It is believed that it is better to assign the male or female gender, and then wait.
But we don't know what the law will turn out to be, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be categorised as a third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid gender," she said.
German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not fight at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said German law would "grant powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes but has DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie has developed feminine traits.
It has a vagina, but it has no uterus and ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and working as an intern in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some leeway not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and think it over, and it gives them time to write "man" or "woman."
In this respect, all is well – you are raising your child and loving him.
You have an amazing baby and you enjoy it.
You do not need to rush with an operation that is irreversible.
"It gives the child the opportunity to be involved in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child decides what gender he or she identifies with more – and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was brought to shore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One crake was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated at a rescue centre by Scottish company SPCA until he recovered.
Operations Centres Colin Seddon said: "This crake probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently he ran out of strength and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again so they contacted us for help."
By the time the crake was released, it was in good shape and health.
Znojmo begins reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium in Znojmo will begin.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the municipal stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Nízký Jeseník in recent times (from the geological point of view).
The last eruptions were still at the beginning of the Quaternary.
When viewed from a greater distance, the white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built in 1755 - 1765, is conspicuous at the top of Uhlířský vrch.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn, which stood next to the church, has not been preserved.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley of four rows of linden trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The Stations of the Cross on Uhlířský vrch are the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stations there are wooden sculptures made by the local artistic woodcarver František Nedomlel.
He used various species of trees from the area of Nízký Jeseník.
Similarly, pedestals made of rocks from the area form an interesting geological exposition.
At each stop, the name of the sponsor is also listed.
Uhlířský vrch is a remnant of a young volcano.
Although radiometric age measurements vary slightly, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than Velký Roudný (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venus volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
It ejected a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with rock fragments from the bedrock, which acquired a reddish-brown color when burned.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters thick.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red and sometimes black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters thick and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
In the tuffs are conspicuous volcanic bombs up to 1 meter in size.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed from the volcano, which today forms a layer of slag basalt up to 50 m thick.
Volcanoes, where volcanic ash eruptions alternate with lava flows, are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they were called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone gradually underwent erosion.
However, it was threatened by rock mining in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuffs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public and thus preserved this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which quickly weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing relatively quickly.
To complicate matters further, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of flora and fauna.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can get to Uhlířský vrch by following the green tourist trail from Bruntál or from Slezský Kočov.
Motorists can use the free parking lot at the beginning of the linden alley, where a short nature trail begins.
A drunk man poured petrol over the whole house: He threatened to set it on fire along with his own family!
The tension was increasing, the fear was escalating.
The man threatened to set the whole house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire brigade unit from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigade, went to the scene.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene and tried to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
A riot squad had to break into the house and disarm the man and handcuff him.
The aggressor then ended up being examined in the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol detention station.
Firefighters eventually doused the gasoline-soaked house with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to people, all pets were rescued from the house.
The man did not give in to the police negotiator, so the commando went after him.
Anger over the verdict handed down to the mastermind of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict handed down to the last of the masterminds brought to justice, saying that Omar Patek should have been executed.
Friday, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted persons, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for assembling explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be released on parole in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta that left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of church bombings in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution asked for life in prison, even though they could have insisted that the man nicknamed "Demolition man" receive the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
The decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other masterminds nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Speaking to the AAP, Ms Corteen said: "He should be put before a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a powerful bomb placed in an outside-parked van was detonated shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar where, just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times.
Mr Hughes said Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jamaah Islamiya terror cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... There is simply no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not that much.
Patek stood trial as the last of the Bali bombers.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent claimed in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," Mrs. Corteen said.
To this day, he has not felt remorse for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year," Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope, reducing the group to 120 voting cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a gathering of current cardinals, known as a consistory, would be held before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Catholic Voices' Jack Valero said the number of cardinal voters was likely to fall by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of electors back to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Next year's consistory will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that the pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's completely new.
Valero said popes have traditionally promoted bishops from large positions to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises — so we don't know who he will appoint."
Land Rover racing series announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercom devices.
Choose from improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable path to world-class racing.
We're excited to be working with Land Rover and MSA to offer this journey and believe this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the rigour and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge – it's going to be a really exciting rally.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter will close next week's Strings of Autumn
Saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will put an end to the 18th annual Strings of Autumn festival next Wednesday.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Great Hall of Lucerna together with his quartet consisting of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined with spontaneous jazz improvisation by the PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's arrangements for symphony orchestra will include the song Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his eightieth birthday this August, Shorter is still full of energy, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at the Strings of Autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of artists he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell and Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the direction of a new style of fusion in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the last thirteen years he has performed mainly with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
A kind of afterparty after the festival will be the Spotlight club night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy / NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and the young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles, will present the Czech audience.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have demonstrated exactly what bombing Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent out planes, they hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and do not comment further.
The exact opposite of Obama's confused and grandiose Syria policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media with claims that a "Syrian base" or "supplies to Hezbollah" were bombed.
I recently wrote here that while US aid to secular rebels in the country remains only rhetorical, Russia happily continues to supply weapons to Syria.
A fresh shipment of Russian missiles unloaded at the port of Latakia has become the target of an Israeli airstrike.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although popular internet theories suggest it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government awarded 2 members of the Sleeping Force, probably Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.
There is a known heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city, I think they were members of a secret CIA commando unit made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere located at the CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (on one of which both SEALs died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of a U.S. commando unit in Tripoli, and as soon as they received news of the Benghazi attack, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is baffled by the fact that during the attack the commando was not deployed officially and in its entirety and that it was simply hesitant about what to do.
The detail leader, without orders, apparently releases these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that there are not one-time, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors in the country is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently nothing of the kind was officially admitted, and even now there is only talk of a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US, albeit half-heartedly, is trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although to solve the national situation, it would take much more help.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian Air Force for prosecuting American drones.
Little is known, however, about how the Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you accidentally manage to discover your drone in the airspace, nothing can be done about it.
However, if a drone is discovered by the Iranians in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom chased an American drone in international space over the sea, which may have been the first live deployment of the American F-22 Raptor super fighter in history.
He flew under Phantem to visually verify his armament without the Phantom spotting him on radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared and asked the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without a murmur.
It's no wonder when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He cannot compare with the Raptor.
Court blocks regulation on procedure for stopping and searching people by the NY Police Department
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked an injunction demanding changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program and removed the judge from the case.
The Second U.S. Federal Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be delayed until the city's appeal was decided.
A judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its findings and its amending orders, including a decision to assign oversight to help the police department change its procedures and its training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments Tuesday in favor of the requested postponement.
The Court of Appeal said the judge must be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the judge's code of conduct by failing as a judge to act on the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she openly responded to criticism of the court.
A judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their stop-search program.
It set up an independent overseer to oversee major changes, including reform of procedures, training and oversight, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some of the areas where stop-by-people are most frequent.
In August, New York City agreed to end the method of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police search.
An oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-search tactic has been criticized by many civil rights advocates.
Stop-and-search has existed in some form for decades, but recorded searches under independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg have risen dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, wrote a lawsuit that became a class action case.
Proponents of changes to the NYP's stop-search program argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these procedures.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that money will be wasted but will not solve the broader problem of the police force being under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NY Police Department introduced searches.
CDC Issues Guidelines for Schools on Childhood Allergy
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines to help with childhood food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to make teachers and staff aware of childhood food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also advises schools to have adrenaline available – the EpiPen brand automatic injector is most commonly used – to respond to potentially life-threatening sensitivities.
State legislatures recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, "It's like someone poking my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue," or "My tongue itches."
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on the Tipsport.cz site.
But I didn't finish it because there was someone sitting at the branch who couldn't complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved and thanks to that my address and ID card number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it was not possible because I had a different ID number, address and that it simply could not be completed and that I should request the deletion of data and make a new registration.
So I did and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to the technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the applicable law on personal data protection.
On the next day, the technical support wrote to me that I should complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails to technical support, where finally after the 4th urgency 25.10. they wrote that the personal data was deleted at my request.
So one would think that he could make the new registration and here the problems started again, first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand, it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but in the end they also excluded this).
So I used a different username and it jumped out that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how it is possible, they wrote back that the personal data really deleted 25.10. and to send an e-mail with the error.
This I did (yesterday around 3 p.m.) and today they wrote back that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that therefore it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been contacting technical support for a week and dealing with them that it is still not possible.
Never mind that if what they claim is true (which it isn't) is true, no one with the same name or date of birth could register if that is already registered.
By the way, at 13.22 I actually registered, with the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictitious e-mail and phone number and surprisingly, a page appeared that they sent me a link to complete the registration by e-mail.
But how is this possible if you cannot register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to e-mail and phone number and data simply did not discard as it claims.
So again, I told tech support that they're just lying (either intentionally or they don't know what they're writing) because what they're writing isn't true.
I have documented several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10., so the "fake" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a terse sentence - I'm sorry, but since you are already re-registered, we can not verify your claims.
And he ended the communication.
Respectively, it repeats the same sentence over and over that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on that link in the email and didn't actually take place.
To sum up, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims, but it also lies when it claims the opposite.
What is worse is that it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things started to move a bit and an e-mail came from Technical Support that they are forwarding the matter for review and I will be informed (after a week of urging and arguing and notifying about the same error).
We are sorry for the killings, but we are innocent, Khmer Rouge officials say
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
Under Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population, lost their lives to exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, and executions.
The commander of the notorious S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by saying they believed they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea of the true extent of the killings.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to "mistreat people or kill them, deny them food or commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives to the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che's apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about others," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she added, adding that Khmer Rouge leaders are "worse than monsters."
Ieng Sary, the Khmer Rouge regime's "foreign minister," was also scheduled to stand trial, but he died in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found unable to trial due to dementia by a court in September 2012.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes glowing.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue – it increases the pH level in the protein and consequently causes it to be emitted.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company 'Lick me I'm delicious', says: "It's an amazing substance, but in terms of production we're just getting started, so for £200 you get about 2g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We've been testing it over the past few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween as it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish glow is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each scoop costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's Experimental Company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavours of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make invisible ice cream."
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Ski resorts want to make it cheaper for families with children
Oil prices fell further to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories were offset by a report that showed a strengthening of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil indicator for December deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European e-trading on the New York Merchandilist Stock Exchange by late morning.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents, falling 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Abundant oil reserves have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. inventories have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, inventories increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese manufacturing gave rise to more demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth that rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two weak decades.
Brent crude, a measure for international crude also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Martin Doktor on the problems with the Sochi Olympics: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, then he just exhales deeply, "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is happening?
Many things work slower and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information about essential things, not so much.
For example, we have been asking them for three months to tell us how the individual villages will be officially labeled, so that we can do a whole range of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
They are still communicating on a number of things.
Is the Olympic Village at least finished?
But this is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago we walked around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean that they are empty?
Are ready-made floors needed?
Just basic concrete, that was the state a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there as a vanguard on January 26, there will still be a smell of glue.
And if they can't, then what?
Do you think President Putin would drive the army there?
That's exactly how it will turn out.
Just so that it is not that the Olympic villages = Potemkin villages.
Rather, there is a risk that they will not be able to adjust the paths, for example, they will not finish the details.
Perhaps the roads will be in such a state that we will have to take our boots from the London Games with us.
But I believe they will put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, that number changes.
For example, figure skaters will probably go in the trio they went out.
Nobody has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is in development.
Still have a trip to Sochi ahead of you?
No, if nothing happens, I should not fly there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves with a tape measure so that we didn't just believe the sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what is the head of mission doing a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing the usual agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Instead of post-election sirloin post-election goulash
The October elections produced a bunch of losers rather than winners.
These are not only parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous governing parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD due to their internal split.
Instead of festive sirloin, politicians served us post-election goulash at the weekend.
The jumper of the elections became the movement of Andrej Babiš, which promised voters to change the existing political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party play into the political (will) of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
The president may have lost his strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, but he still has several ways to regain it - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD's chances of winning the prime minister's seat are receding in my eyes, they are getting closer to businessman Andrej Babiš.
The post-election development is still far from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by the Communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus for the economy.
Given the vocal opposition of ANO to join forces with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still a coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite disheartening for the ČSSD.
A minority ČSSD government composed of "non-Zemanists" at the Castle will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSSD participates will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself: "Are we not heading for another early election by itself?"
The next election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the ANO voter mandate.
ČSSD's plans to introduce sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes and the construction of a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
On the other hand, the parties ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit agree, for example, on support for business, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support for the employment of disadvantaged people, and a reduction in the lower VAT rate on selected goods.
Friction surfaces are most common in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
However, ANO now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition of ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons cited were corruption, squandering money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that this state of affairs suited the majority of citizens.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the state that was here (stealing and indebtedness of this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not turn up to vote, 596,357 voters voted for TOP 09,384,174 voters voted for ODS, so a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
If I add 1,016,829 CSSD voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all these parties participated in the "theft" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of legitimate voters actually agreed with this situation.
In this way, the majority of voters have made it clear that they are not in favor of punishing the culprits of stealing and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the ČSSD members who participated in this will push for the appropriate laws?
Is it even to help us?
Olomouc to open a public ice rink in the historical centre
Pavel Spálený, the organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, said that the preparatory work on the ice rink began on October 26 and the ice production unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the stage occupies 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stalls at their disposal.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the stage is roofed so that the skaters can comfortably change their shoes," Spálený described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square to repair the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice rink could return to its original location.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink was open from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas market, which includes a rich cultural program, will start on the Upper Square one month before Christmas Eve.
Scientists have shed more light on how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that joyful dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs swing their tails mostly to the left.
But now scientists say other dogs can spot and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa in dogs, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs react to the asymmetrical wagging of other dogs' tails, the researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films about dogs – either in natural or silhouette form – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail to show it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw an otherwise featureless dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog wagging its tail), it remained completely calm.
But when she noticed the tail turning mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a dog wagging its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals looked insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he doesn't think dogs consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and must not pay attention to.
He said: "If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behaviour, and movement to the right breeds less friendly behaviour, you will react based on that experience."
The researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their pets' emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a university lecturer in veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right sides were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another paper from Victoria University in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to become familiar with robot dogs when they wag their tails to the left than to the right, when they became insecure – exactly the opposite of the Italian study."
The difference, he said, may be that the dogs in these various studios didn't interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs entirely as dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs react to real dogs could help.
"Although in the case of many different mammals there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, another indication that global investigations by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended as part of a widening investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspensions but confirmed that it had received a request for information from authorities this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the incident said RBS had passed to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent to and from the former trader's accounts.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European Chair of Foreign Exchange Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi's European chairman of cash trading, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders was charged with any offence.
Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the incident said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma announced it had investigated suspicious foreign exchange market machinations at several Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating claims that these bankers colluded to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from the relevant authorities.
Banks scour through years-old instant messages and emails to find cases of violations.
News of the investigations has alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines of profit generation in investment banks' closures in recent years, but which has been hampered by the fact that low currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the situation, arguing that the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the slicing of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired from its stock trading department this week a trader who caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the relevant authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved," Credit Suisse said.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the Christian Democrats have sent Jan Kasal against Babiš.
The Christian Democrats won fourteen deputies in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to negotiate the contours of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006 for the People's Party.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will resemble the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal then," Kasal said, estimating how this year's talks will unfold.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200km/h with a hot drink between his legs
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to charges that he had driven carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and a £100 surcharge for the accused.
Prospal: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have juice, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospal, family has always come first, so at the age of 38 he wants to fully submit to it.
Either he gets a job overseas and prolongs his career, or he quits hockey for good.
"I want to fulfill the role of dad and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned workhorse who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can pull his teammates together.
And despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he says firmly.
Maybe he will, reportedly the New York Rangers, who did not have a good start to the season and have two injured mainstays - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you join Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there is no point in worrying about it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere has it been added that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it is simply not so.
You didn't even hear from the club?
Such communication in the NHL happens every day.
It's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When a player gets injured or someone can't do it and the team doesn't work.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, similar circumstances occur, don't they?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured and the team didn't start the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there is always a chance.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides.
I would take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received any yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality in which I have to live.
On Friday you are leaving for America, are you expecting that something might work out after all?
I have those expectations for July 5, when the NHL free agent market opened, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
Certainly not, I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
It is given by the fact that I am a father and a husband and everything depends on that.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment – I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to be a dad and husband and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday Vašík has two hockey matches, it is a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Thinking of doing this in quotes full-time?
Sure, one can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
Once it gets to the point where all the goals, wins and passes won't replace what you have at home.
Because family and children are the meaning of life.
Let you have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play in the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - besides my family - is also sporting success.
The NHL is the best league in the world.
And family life depends on this.
My children, sorry, our children - mine and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would love for them to continue this trend.
Because let's face it, in America the possibilities are somewhere else entirely.
That is the chance we should offer them.
So are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We will practice it as we do now.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter, in Tampa or wherever our steps take us.
That's ideal, to be warm all the time.
I have been very lucky in my life.
You can say that I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and self-denial and it took a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey has offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who yearn for this so they can choose what they do and how they live.
How long will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
yes, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you're still in the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't say how much longer it will stay there.
This can't be planned.
So you can say that this season you wait to see how it turns out and then decide what to do next?
I'm at a stage where I'm going day by day.
Distant planets, black-and-white films or a bit of fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would casually bring.
In the concept of his quartet, which will conclude this year's Strings of Autumn festival on 6 November in the great hall of Prague's Lucerna, everything is related to everything.
The score of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's quartet is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, colleagues two generations younger are supposed to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
However, the newly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, winner of nine Grammys, former bandmate of Miles Davis and today probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain this principle.
He doesn't talk much about music, although his overall outlook on life is closely related to music.
In my eighties, I came to the conclusion that it was best to let life surprise you.
"Too many people plan everything and then get disappointed when things turn out differently," Shorter said.
Jagr joked: A goal from the gate?
He got the puck in the defensive zone and nobody caught it again.
In addition, he converted the escape after a quick forehand loop.
Jaromir Jagr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night he commented on the 119th winning goal in the NHL on Facebook.
"After watching this video, the director of Czech Railways contacted my agent Petr Svoboda and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their most modern Pendolino train!"
They say we are very similar in type.
I guess I'll have to stop training nights to not get even faster.
"I'm afraid that the Minister of Defense might then speak up and advertise jets!" he added with smileys.
New Jersey also picked up its second win in a row.
"And most importantly, you noticed - the treatment of Marie Rottrová works," Jagr concluded.
The brutal murder of a senior citizen in the Zlín region will again be dealt with by the Regional Court
The Regional Court acquitted a twenty-five-year-old Slovak and a twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied guilt.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court annulled the regional court's decision and returned the case to him for hearing.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons for this, saying that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the youths assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a harrowing death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled, punched and kicked him all over his body and also inflicted about three dozen wounds to his head with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures to the cranial bone, swelling of the brain and bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The youths reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, the only, moreover, indirect evidence against the defendants was scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the statutory instructions.
Although scent traces from the crime scene and other items were identical to those of the defendants in more than ten cases, the police initially treated them as factual and not scent traces.
In addition, certain errors in their handling were found.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants has not been proven beyond doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead senior with a shattered head was found by relatives who thought he may have fallen and injured himself.
The violent death was not reported by the emergency medical services who were called.
Detectives were contacted several days later by Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces from the crime scene that the relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in the Uherské Hradiště region.
He is currently serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths who are responsible for robberies of jewelry stores.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior citizen in Slopné.
The younger of the accused of murdering a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with the legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaint, which collects evidence of favoritism of the castle retinue.
In the past, the influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík has not been documented in this way, let alone signed it.
True, the editors stood up for the management.
The described cases, however, do not answer the question of where such attachment of some journalists to the Zemans comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or, not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of misplaced empathic helpfulness.
And assuming general rottenness, one cannot help but wonder whether other, no less unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, are striving to change the situation in television.
Those who say that there are no blatant attempts to intervene by politicians in broadcasting are right in developed countries.
But it is also true that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public service media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be a tendentiousness inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we simply have not yet reached this stage of civilization, and this situation does not exist with us.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of the confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides.
As crowds of horse showcase experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only took his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, slipped smoothly through three rounds to eventually win the grand prize, leaving 30 rolling adult competitors behind.
The inseparable pair – of equal height – were praised for their looks, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He faced gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret at a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural handling skills, which far exceeded his age.
And Toffee received top marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee for his third birthday in March and has been practicing with the Shetland pony daily ever since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee work well together."
They did not have high hopes, but in the end they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffeo and when he won we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and complete strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
The boy, from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheering and applauding."
He ran the length of the arena on the sand and although he looked so tiny, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and the farm, and has been put in charge of two chickens.
Given the way he started, he'll be back in Horse of the Year again soon and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: "Fenton is only three, but he already knows how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their outstanding performance and the way they performed on the rally track.
They always see how good the teamwork is between the pony and the one who leads it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure the adorable outfit helped Fenton, he really fit in with it.
Snowden willing to 'cooperate' with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch from the US intelligence services, has announced that he is willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he had been granted asylum, on Thursday to discuss the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP delivered to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as deserters and seeks to criminalise political speech with heavy lawsuits that leave no room for defence."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges filed against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
Tensions in relations between the US and Germany began to rise when claims emerged that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads a parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were any opportunity to interview Mr. Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US," it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on Twitter.
He was accompanied on his trip to Russia by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need reassurance that he would be "safe" there, a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a harsh and sustained campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said the world's reaction to his "act of political expression" had encouraged him.
Citizens everywhere and senior officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the exposure of an unjustifiable system of pervasive surveillance as a public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
So that I don't choke on hatred
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Vítr, tma, přítomnost.
That it will not be a slim volume is suggested by the number of pages comparable to his best-known work, The Thicket (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahuda interviewed another prominent contemporary Czech writer - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after twelve years of silence?
I did it - so as not to choke on hatred.
To see around him more and more clones of this human foolish pettiness, young organisms afflicted by blind selfish efforts.
I'm not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless lust, scoundrel souls and oppositely reversed ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the expression of a small whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my squeamish friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I've gotten over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from living on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks and then read books by the lamp in the evening.
You talk about a sense of frustration, hatred.
Was there a turning point somewhere in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The turning point came a long time ago, when I was about ten years old.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, and after that I lived.
But somewhere inside, there's still a surprised quiet boy.
I see other solitary exercisers, each in their tornado of anguish.
Writing books saved me.
I am participating in this huge, thousand-year-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an elusive future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir of our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, where through trial and error more and more generations of beings are created, creating some superhuman, artificial intelligence in trillions of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather dialogue, conducted by the right and left halves of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
Just as periods of peace are interwoven with quietly dormant metastases of wars that may one day awaken - so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt a mute avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, it would one day quietly overwhelm me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and asked to layers that are stored in the darkness "below the surface of consciousness."
The neocortex, the grey matter of the brain, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient rings of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, looks for an answer in the flight of birds, raises his gaze to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
You often talk about the ego metaphorically – could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its cognitive, cognitive, process, being exposed to an ever-changing present, in a constant effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes overload failures occur.
By analogy - as if your PC "crashed", from a speech emulator and translator program from foreign languages, you would get tangled first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful reboots you ended up at the dark green flickering screen of the Bios, in the base system that controls functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the hitherto functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a rift appears.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "So long did he look into the abyss until the abyss looked into him."
A genuine feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, he mentally "dies" and a new quality begins.
And why am I personally interested?
I will answer with a parable.
Once upon a time one fell into a pool and drowned, the days, months and years passed, he was always drowning while reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a "diver".
Perhaps a sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal's texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, of the specific person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, others super ego, but I think Arthur Rimbaud best characterized it in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else – this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine, ran around Stínadly in dark streets.
In the end, behind all the branching of the authors and their message, it is: "The Sun Bright of the Worlds of Other Worlds by Karel Hynek Mácha".
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the feedback that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, perhaps years later, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are really "lives," or rather "worlds."
They are encoded in the signs of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of a particular language.
We can bring them to life at any time by letting their sentences flow to the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to ancient demonological books, we are committing witchcraft.
After the publication of the book - as it happens - a chain of author readings awaits you.
I remember you once liked to read.
Will you throw yourself into it again with joy, or do you feel differently after years?
Today, I prefer to just talk.
And what did I find out in the process?
There are good, intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic feature - they are inconspicuous, do not draw too much attention to themselves, have a friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
Let me give you an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec there lived (and I hope he still lives) a curly-haired bookseller (his name is aptly Červenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl's bull.
During one drink, he introduced me to the individual links in the chain of readers of my book The Thicket.
I looked into their eyes, and then was shown a tattered, worn copy of my book.
Embarrassed, I put down the sausage I had just read and wept briefly in a masculine manner.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and drunkenly in tears.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't stand it and roared headfirst out of the window into the snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night landscape and, caught up in the happy rabies of the sensitives, the aching soul of our compatriots and the nostalgia of the forgotten patriots - howled and brayed like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and content-wise different from the previous ones.
Is this also true of the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a narrative.
It is a fairy tale about one country beyond nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin, in his novel Sukhodil, puts the words of an old Russian myth into the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
Lies a dog, on it a gray chest.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It's never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps once upon a time we were devils in hell and drew lots - what role will we play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it to the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, influences our volition from such a depth and in such a breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we act with absolute certainty exactly in line with our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
This is the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shore of the ocean of unconsciousness and catching tides of warm wind in a leaky sail made of dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
English literature classes will require at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novella, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also include "hidden text" to motivate deeper reading;
Combined courses in English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a baccalaureate in a language and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to release a new curriculum for English and maths tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other key subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate move, Ofqual, which oversees GCSEs, will reveal changes in the structure of GCSEs, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society" and that there was a need to insist that GCSEs be "more demanding, more ambitious and more rigorous".
The study shows that English schools devote less time to maths – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
By comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours a year to mathematics and about 138 in Singapore.
While there will be no official requirement to devote more time to math, coalition sources said a comprehensive GCSE in mathematics – along with a greater emphasis on the subject on leaderboards – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra tuition.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not cancer in ČSSD
Before the elections, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD flared up.
Everything culminated when the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to the court for the undemocratic composition of candidates.
Despite this, the participants in the case did not want to comment too much on this, so as not to damage the party even more before the elections.
But now the votes are counted.
The leadership of Ostrava's ČSSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to leave the party on Monday evening and will probably push for him to lose his position.
But Petr Kajnar wants to fight on.
What the disputes are about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Deník.
How do you perceive the outcome of the elections?
The CSSD certainly counted on a much better result.
Was it damaged by the fact that disputes within the party were being resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that the Social Democrats could have had a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, it is internally ill, and people perceive that all is not well in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of ČSSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through a decline for some time now, and unfortunately similar things are happening in the Social Democrats now.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends in the ODS, have moved to the people in the ČSSD and have influence on them.
It is then related to the fact that the police walk around the offices of the Ostrava City Hall and collect computers.
It shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague as well, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Haškovec and Sobotkovci.
But even that has been in the works for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.
Hašek's wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
One is in a situation in politics where one sometimes has to make compromises.
But everyone has an internal boundary where it is no longer possible to make compromises, and this is also my case.
Originally, I did not want to run for the Chamber of Deputies, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get on the regional list in order to strengthen Sobotka's wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But Hašek's wing put a stop to it.
Why do you stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
In my opinion, Slávek Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I confess that I have not heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidium, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can start just dismissing the Party Chairman.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the party statutes.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you perceive the fact that the Ostrava leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on a competition to see who will place among their members.
The competition should be largely based on program visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, this competition is also entered by people who do not have much ability or vision, but a political party is an elevator for them to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people come to the fore by unscrupulously breaking the rules, violating the party statutes.
With their practices, they turn political parties into mafias, and in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Drawing attention to this problem is more important to me than taking into account whether a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the statutes.
That is why, before the elections, you filed a petition with the court for a preliminary injunction against the form of the ČSSD candidate list in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current ČSSD District Executive Committee in Ostrava is consolidating its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establishing new organizations, gradually throwing out inconvenient party members.
An example is that they wanted to expel Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rather canceled the resolution on his expulsion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party's statutes through the courts is indeed the last resort, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is trying to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, is interested in this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to dismiss me.
They promise people positions, get votes, and in return for those votes, they consolidate their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could label me as a person who puts money where it does not belong.
At the same time, the city bought property that is of great strategic value to it.
So how do you see it going on with your continued presidency as mayor?
The district committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider remaining in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like a thief shouting, "Catch the thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I do not see anyone in the Ostrava Social Democrats who would initiate and promote, sometimes even against party members, the creation of so many development issues, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Despite all this, I become uncomfortable.
I don't read it other than that I'm preventing others from breaking through to the places they want.
Will you continue to fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, political parties must also work well.
I find it hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state if it cannot even manage itself.
So I'm not thinking about leaving the ČSSD now, because I think that the person causing the cancer of this party is not me, but these people who are trying to me off.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's a bit of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful in terms of results recently, the defender or midfielder of Viktoria Plzeň, František Rajtoral, has a form that has earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, full of activity, after the intervention on him was ordered in the match in Teplice penalty kick.
Viktoria reached for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end they took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team in the match with Jablonec will break the unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative attracts fans to the stands of the Doosan Arena.
Pilsen's last matches did not go as it would have liked, but the word crisis defender Viktoria rejects.
That's how it goes in football, sometimes you have good form and sometimes you have worse.
But I would not talk about a crisis in any way.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," said the West Bohemia defender.
The Viktoria team will again rely on the support of fans.
"It's played on Friday night and I want to invite our fans, who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," adds Rajtoral.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called in open letters to students, teachers and the management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedom against the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman.
I met with more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary chairman of SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of not being invited to the celebration of the national day of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were not so brave and made Miloš Zeman's visit possible: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Grammar School in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, J.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice we see the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
The newly elected ODS MP, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it really is not the same as if you stayed, for example, in the position of mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the ranks of ČSSD governors who perform the function of deputy and governor at the same time and, like them, degrade both professions?
You're telling people that both of these demanding functions can be handled with the left rear.
I know, we have the example of Michal Hašek, who can even handle several dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not an example of a person you should follow.
Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave her parliamentary post in order to fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the position of Dean is that the concurrence of functions will violate the apolitical nature of the academic campus of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the Pardubice ODS sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help "your" school without remaining a dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and save face.
Otherwise, it may happen that your voters will count it in the next election.
And that doesn't have to last long.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, the collection of information served to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first admission from Washington" was made amid fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass surveillance of data by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which also targeted US allies.
"In some cases, I concede, as the president (Barack Obama has done), some of these actions have gone too far, and we make sure that doesn't happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the existing practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the US, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or the London attacks in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to be informed of the plots in a timely manner," Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The U.S. intelligence scandal, which reportedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their indignation, with some calling on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict surveillance.
The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) had been charged before the charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse has learned that before charges were brought against child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales had been charged with child sexual abuse.
But it was said before the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association said that they had never dealt with a child sexual abuse case in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offenses, and another in which a YMCA Caringbah gym teacher was convicted in 1991 of sexually molesting children in his care.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, an adviser to the commission, that he knew about the first case but not about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's introductory statement was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were conducted at the YMCA to honor the organization as a leading advocate for children's rights.
The evidence presented by the commission suggests that the YMCA was alerted to having received the second lowest of the four possible ratings in an audit by the Ministry of Education and Society in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the downward leadership failed to hire Mr Lord without making sure staff were aware of the obligation to report child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually molesting 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr Hare dismissed claims that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting breaches of child safety by Mr Lord.
Members of staff gave evidence that they witnessed such breaches, including Lord being alone with the children, babysitting them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord ́s supervisor, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to."
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt uncomfortable contacting their superiors and reporting the crimes.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment, which is why they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had given the YMCA board in New South Wales his view that the lesson of the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organisation was that staff had "not reported" and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager for children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid tampering with the evidence, but it was "overzealous" and poorly executed.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organisation between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, screening, training, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Václav Matyáš, President of the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic: New Green Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the state's lack of interest in solving the issue of capital construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens, who save considerable amounts on heating after the implementation of the measures, but also an opportunity for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Every billion invested will bring more than 2700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the state's fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, and it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Building Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the Government resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow the continuation of the programme so that further calls can be announced within its framework.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological advances on planes (but not make calls from their cell phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-gate electronic devices — in addition to making calls from their mobile phones — to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music under eagerly awaited new rules released by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated cabin crew training manuals and storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Among the companies that have already handed over plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the aircraft is descending to land and not to turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose planes are properly protected against electronic jamming can allow their passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely implemented – and we will work closely with transport companies on this – it will be a success," Glading said in a statement.
Frankly, we are tired of looking like "watchmen".
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and texts, and downloading data will still be prohibited below 3 kilometers of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be told to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, the online scrabble game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when, as is well known, he was thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored for fear that they could hurt someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Commission.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national traffic safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference to broadcast towers in the air," Rosenker said.
A industry advisory committee created by the FAA to investigate the issue suggested last month that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, say there is no valid safety case for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical achievement of the time.
The new airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generation aircraft, but they are also designed, and approved by the FAA, to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes.
Plans modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio transmissions than previous generation devices.
For example, e-readers emit only minimal broadcasts when turning a page.
But the broadcast is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing for restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers to be relaxed is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the airliner with their electronic Kindle readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA's advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Airline Passenger Association, said he believes interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device while flying by instrument in low visibility.
The travel industry group welcomed the changes and said it was a sensible practice for the travelling public, who are using the technology extensively.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage had "gone too far."
John Kerry has hinted at a softening of the U.S. defense stance on its surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage has "gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting on "autopilot" in light of the inflammatory revelations about the NSA's spying activities that emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The published information has sparked a diplomatic firestorm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said via video link at an open cabinet conference in London: "There's no doubt that the president and I and others in the administration actually learned about some of the things that happened out of inertia, because there was that possibility, referring to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War, and then, of course, September 11."
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that abuse has occurred.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was committed to good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent on murdering and blowing people up and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being executed, because we already know about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are heading to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans that they must continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participation in counterterrorism organizations because they were disillusioned with National Security Agency surveillance.
It is indeed important for U.S. national security interests that Europe stays in the same boat with us in view of joint efforts to fight terrorism, Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I'm heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite their anger at NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings of metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had spied on the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was commonplace on both sides.
Amid the tumult, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip this year and hoped to include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other lawmakers who intend to participate are expected to be released in the coming days.
He said the program is still in the works.
Although Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help repair relationships, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be in place.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to the espionage programs they have used for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones spying here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to hostility sparked by U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activity.
For the words "Mugabe is a limp donkey" there is no longer a threat of imprisonment, the court struck down the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be careful about speaking in public about eighty-nine-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 80s and has led the country since late 1987.
Under Section 33 of the Penal Code, disparaging the presidency was punishable by a fine of $100 to one year in prison.
"Public prosecutors should not be eager to accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, the BBC reported.
A number of aggrieved Zimbabweans have spoken out against the law, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist was jailed for calling Mugabe a "limping donkey" in public.
In August, prosecutors charged a twenty-six-year-old man with his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared unconstitutional a law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements are later turned out to be false," said Deputy Attorney General Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law allowed a person who published false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
"The existence of a law that criminalizes someone for making false statements has a chilling effect on the right to express oneself freely," Malala added.
Despite Mugabe ruling the country with a heavy hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in March following a referendum.
The country took small steps away from the one-man dictatorship in 2009, when a deal between Mugabe and the opposition propelled Morgan Tsvangiraj to the premiership.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, only the currencies of other states are used.
The impoverished economy is to Mugabe's imprudent agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed white farmers' land among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with running farms.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the plot itself sloping somewhat.
The requirement also stated that two generations would live in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a gently sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
"When creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' household is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are related.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, as they differ in different final treatment of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped using plank panels, the part where the office is is plastered white, leaving the remaining elements in a clean concrete finish without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very interconnected with the exterior.
The parents' household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, is surrounded by a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
The connection between the interior and the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is how the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and give it something unique.
The household of a young couple is conceived as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and from there climbs the stairs upwards.
Fire brigades arrived to rescue a lost puppy that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was spotted trapped in a quarry by a man walking his dog.
Firefighters rappelled down the rock face to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire brigades who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived alone for three days until he was rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to reunite Ruby and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away after being involved in a minor accident, they frantically searched for their missing dog and posted calls on social media.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, an Auror dog owner spotted Ruby stranded on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and rappelled down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to lift him up the rock.
Expert Commander of the Technical Rescue Team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
He didn't flinch during the rescue – he was totally frozen.
But now he's okay.
He was then given biscuits.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that the dog has been spotted is unbelievable.
Expert commander of the technical rescue team, Peter Lau, said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was scared at the sight of the rescue operation."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him in my arms again.
The vet said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
In the ČKD industrial area in Prague, a cooling tower burned down at night
In the ČKD industrial area in Prague, a large-capacity tank was on fire, apparently a cooling tower, according to firefighters.
"Firefighters went to the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they were still extinguishing the fire," Prague firefighters spokeswoman Pavlína Adamcová said.
According to the measurements, the amount of pollutants in the air in the surroundings did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
About fifty firefighters gradually arrived at the premises in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire in a high-capacity storage tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamcova said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we extinguish the fire using transport lines from the tankers," she added.
According to the server, tn.cz was complicated by a poorly functioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The fire brigade commander declared the second stage of the fire alarm.
There are four grades in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is announced.
Chemists also went to the site to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have gotten into the air during the fire.
"However, they did not measure a level of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygiene standards," a spokeswoman for the fire brigade said.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health service
The federal government is insisting that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's moribund health system include tough conditions to ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Union was taking "urgent action" to avert a crisis caused by the island's ageing population, higher numbers of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for patient-requested surgeries.
Another 2600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help eliminate indebtedness.
There is also money for free access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian healthcare system," Ms Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting and record-keeping regime.
The state will need to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money from the Union of Australia, and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be of no use "until there is genuine reform to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania's public health system".
Still, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first raised in talks with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe the federal aid package can extricate the state's public health service from critical condition," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, a spokesman for the federal opposition on healthcare, believes today's statement is just a "band-aid."
"The reason I'm here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health system," he told ABC TV.
You cannot have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth of Australia donating 300 million dollars and pretend that this is good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Music is playing in the metro on Můstek
The Prague Public Transport Company (DPP) has launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where recorded instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the metro, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The trial operation will last six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos to ease tensions
In the future, police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They would spend up to half of their errands here.
They would keep order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior counts on this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would be helped mainly by "speeding up the provision of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
Some 80,000 people lived there, mainly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
Usury was rampant.
According to experts, the number of problem localities has increased by a hundred in the meantime.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are becoming more tense.
Anti-Romani marches were held in several places.
The extremists were joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the Interior Ministry, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
An essential condition is "consistent application of equal access in law enforcement".
However, this cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
A specialist would run errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a problem locality, he would keep order in order.
He would also know the locals, so he would be better able to solve problems or offenses.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of unlawful conduct," the ministry said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive bonuses of 500 to 1,000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbours.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements here," the report's authors said.
It is not yet clear how many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic.
The answer is to be given by an analysis that identifies places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release for these officers each year after the end of the project.
According to the project proposal, the selected police officers will first complete an internship in Slovakia.
Fifty members should undergo this training every year.
From them will emerge the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers who will work in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the ideas of the Interior, it would have three categories.
Hostels with precise rules, such as the number of people per room, would meet the minimum standard.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social flats, which would be comparable to ordinary housing, would have a higher standard.
Tenants would have to comply with an integration plan drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to comply with the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of living.
According to the Interior Ministry, the transitional housing system should operate for at least 30 years until the next generation grows up "in a pro-integration-motivated environment".
The model of social housing is prepared by the ministries for regional development and work.
They have until the end of the year to propose it.
Together with Bárta, the inspectorate also arrested an analyst of the anti-corruption police
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought by the Prvnízpravy.cz server.
MF DNES soon found out that the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS) had taken care of the case, and that its people were supposed to arrest Bárta in the centre of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The Inspectorate deals with cases where police officers are among the accused, but its competence also extends to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - the head of analytics and informatics, Jan Petržílek, is among those arrested.
In the past, he worked for the Security Information Service.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the information, adding that the media must turn to the GIBS in this matter.
Her spokeswoman for the inspectorate, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case and immediately referred her to the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said spokeswoman Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be deduced from this vague reaction that the event took place, but it is in a secrecy mode that does not allow the speakers to say anything specific.
Bárta's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represents Bárta "also in this matter", but since this is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bárta's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bárta's arrest could be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
He was promoted to the post by Bárta together with the former chairman of the General Assembly, Radek John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that flared up between former Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV had to be resolved even by the then President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection to me came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about the matter," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Although Radek John officially pushed him through, the real head of the party at that time was Bárta.
Bárta now ran for the elections for the Úsvit movement, but narrowly missed out on his seat by 175 votes.
Úsvit leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our list and, as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," Okamura distanced himself from Bárta, saying before the election that he gave Bárta space to run for Úsvit because he helped him solve the problem of bailiffs.
Vít Bárta found himself on trial in 2012 with his former party mate Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign workers with a visa may undergo a "eligibility" test
As the government intends to expand police crackdowns, it is considering a "eligibility" test for foreign workers with a 457 visa permit.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The loud statements of 'foreigners to the end of the queue' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant relic from a time when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce was to be protected – and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in the region noticed an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to negotiate with officials over human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest remain to be considered.
If the "eligibility" criteria are accepted, visa applicants can be scrutinized as to whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate has a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."
Based on previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders at 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat to Christmas Island this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son travelled to Australia with him and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat after his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
Israeli warplanes attacked a target in Syria, official said
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, an administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press news agency reports that Russian-made SA-125 missiles were targeted.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
She moved from the villa to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance payment.
Ivana therefore quickly looked for alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
She received a tip from friends for an apartment 3 + kk in an older block of flats on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the large forest park and the dam on the other hand excited me," Ivana recalls the first impression.
At first I thought it would be a temporary arrangement for about three years.
"Today we have been living here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change," adds the owner.
At that time, mother and daughter moved from a one-hundred-and-twenty-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, the things were stored at friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hallway, and vice versa a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and divide the room, which allowed for a new location of the lights.
The first intervention she decided to do after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
Another step towards a partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of PVC flooring with laminate flooring.
Ivana did not know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I subscribed to housing magazines looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On the recommendation I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step for the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the layout of the hall was also adjusted.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently wheelchair accessible.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued.
As part of the programme How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping each other with classical principles of optical division, such as semi-partitions or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and uniformity of the space," the architect explains.
We managed to separate the sleeping and living areas in an original way.
All I had to do was turn two sofas back to back and place a custom-made duvet cabinet between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and paintings.
The architect used high-quality marmoleum for the kitchen and dining area floors, and she enlivened the sliding doors with wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette, if necessary, is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marmoleum has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer, non-slippery surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of recesses and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted by color is an example of how to work with space in a prefab.
I left the colors to the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphoglass cladding with the motif of a blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For the warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In the small apartment, we managed to store books, among other things, in the space under the windowsills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the older works excellently, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier and with high-quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
Last came the kitchen.
The lockers used to be placed on both sides and the owner felt a bit like she was in a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and rearranged the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface is softened by a slightly pearlescent surface.
Thanks to the imaginative solution, the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher fit into the small space.
The appearance of the small kitchen was enlivened by all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
The unique graphoglass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is also easy to maintain.
Ivana chose magnolia blossoms that remind her of the favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
The original bathroom had a small bathtub and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower has a glass Ronal door.
The challenge was to create a clear, simple space from the environment in which functions and devices would be in harmony.
We unified the interior in terms of material and color and tried to make it elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of everyday objects," adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát renewed the position of Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
"I consider it essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention by the Ministry.
When performing this profession, not only high professional professionalism is needed, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will gladly and responsibly try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilful nurses in our health service, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients, to perform their profession with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena Šmídová.
On the occasion of her inauguration, the newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nurse's position and intends to cooperate, among other things, with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"Fundamentally, I do not want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, each with their own competencies and, together with other healthcare professionals, forming a well-coordinated working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the practice of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"From my own experience, I know that some administrative tasks unnecessarily burden nurses and take away their time that they could and should rather devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas on which it intends to focus include improving working conditions, finding ways to better mutual cooperation in the team and with the management of health service providers, adjusting competencies and also labor law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading nurses with insufficient numbers at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, but for fear of possible reprisal, they are not documented in a specific case where the rules could be broken.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Head Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and have the specific case examined by the relevant authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been the head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-Medical Disciplines and Recognition of Qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal department, and as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles for professional journals, and has devoted herself to lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot's novella, which features an exceptional cinematic setting and depiction of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 60s of the 18th century in France and tells a grim story about Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally perverted Mother Superior and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slips into lasciviousness or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that the audience will also experience torment similar to wearing a sackcloth shirt.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a jump back a few years, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to run home from school, throw the bag in the corner and run outside.
Play ball games with other children, jump a shot.
Then, during the series Helena and Her Boys, embroider with chain stitch a festive tablecloth for grandma for her birthday.
And then, after several warnings, finally wash the dishes, vacuum, put wood in the tiled stove in the winter and do the homework after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of homework write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, have a homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, whose content did not even lie next to strawberries) and wash it down with tea from dried herbs that my mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio on cassettes that spun loudly in my mother's old tape recorder.
And then we would rewind the tapes on pencil and play the same song over and over again, our favorite, and toast it with a siphon.
Or we talked across the table using cans that were tied together with string - and while we are talking on the phone, in order to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the ear was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it in a way that we didn't lack anything.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads, or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "addition" to the wardrobe was a homemade batik T-shirt using SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with the aforementioned mother's cassette recorder and at most the Walkman, which we shared with my sister and which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Ludo, or as I have already said, to go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the Christmas tree, certainly my parents saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm up for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed strudel into it, apparently he ate the cassettes so beautifully, so she tried to see if she could eat strudel as well.
Unfortunately, he fell asleep, but it was his last bite.
Well, and this incident is still on his father's plate, poor thing.
She says that when Luna was little, she stuffed strudel into a video and thought he would play her a recipe and not play it, so to this day she can't bake it.
I remember how we all managed to communicate, communicate without a mobile phone or computer.
Together with my sister, we agreed with the granddaughter of a neighbor during the holidays at my grandmother's when we would meet again next summer at our grandmother's - and so it was, so it was true.
We met.
Promise yourself now that you will see someone in a year?!
I also remember the winter when we ran outside with the whole village, built snowmen, rode on the snowy hill near the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then the whole family and I had dinner and talked about the day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear the notorious phrase before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's still true today, but you certainly don't have soap tied to the tap in a lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when Dad was "working" with a beer with Jarda from the village in the garage, Mum and I lay down on the floor, rested our feet on the tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackling of wood coming from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we did not write messages to each other daily via various chats, SMS.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at albums where black and white photos are neatly glued with black corners.
And if I didn't know how old I was at the time, the year the picture was taken is always written on the back of the photo.
I see that even though the cuts according to the pot did not suit us very well and we also had my cousin's pants two sizes bigger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather take that step forward - to reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait to see what modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the young adolescent generation at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think that they are missing out on a lot, that they will not experience this "pre-monkey" time either.
I wish them that!
You have to save, young Czechs know.
But most of them do not even know with what interest
More and more Czechs are putting money aside.
However, they do not reach the savings champions in the region.
Austrians save the most money, saving an average of €181 a month.
People in Slovakia also save a little more than Czechs.
These are the results of a survey conducted by the Erste Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that savers' mood is improving, with two-thirds planning to set aside more money.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the list of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of their saving products.
For example, almost every second Serb saves "under his pillow" at home, according to the survey.
In the Czech Republic, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased this year.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents set aside a thousand to 2,500 crowns every month for various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit dropped slightly to CZK 2,078 in a year-on-year comparison.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to increase the value of savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, and compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also dropped significantly.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they are achieving on individual products.
Especially young people under 30 do not know how their money bears interest.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their deposited money, 73 percent of respondents know it among people over fifty years of age.
In an international comparison of the Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent gap.
Australian woman appeals Thai prison stay
A twenty-one-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to fifteen days in prison on Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with false accusation by Phuket Regional Court on June 15 when she told Thai police that a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her had attacked her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket Island police interviewed Bamford for two days before admitting to fabricating the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely worried" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's obviously a challenging time, but we hope he will come back to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she was vacationing in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to legal proceedings that increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
But after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to repair the tarnished image for tourists, which may have been behind the acquittal.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
Lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Kolín Municipal Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the programme Mezi nás singers Lenka Nová, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml, accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benek Orchestra.
After the intro and the acting etude about a delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of the last time they played in Kolín and in the theater and the whole city went out of electricity.
"Otherwise, in Kolín they produced two types of cards, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also reminded a native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times during the evening Horáček, who did not leave the stage and when he did not speak, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched on his new musical act.
Josef Mánes also made a calendar, who put it on the astronomical clock, but he had no idea about ice hockey at that time, as we meet on those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech calendar, but we won't play it here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this album Spát v dne (Sleep in the Day, Sing at Night) and accompanied himself on guitar.
Otherwise, when he did not sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band consisting of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a bit of rhyme Into the Hillside of the Heart Sits, which immediately stirred up the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded afterwards.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, František Segrad's I Recognize was heard, rewarded with huge applause in the original by Richard Müller, Hana Hegerová was reminded by the composition Dad Liked Lída Baarová with Horáček's explanation about the communist ban and the replacement of Baarová by the American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded by the composition Sebastián, Segrado then sang the beautiful composition Prague set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zásmuck and a former Kolíňák.
But that was the end, a standing ovation and an encore in the form of the optimistic song We Live in a Wonderful Time.
There was one more encore on the playlist, but the fans didn't applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole quartet sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also older CDs, Michal Horáček his books and even the cover of the legendary LP and took a photo with potential candidates.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that he was postponing the decision on the construction of units 3 and 4 of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Policy and the approval of Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. for the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should make a recommendation to the shareholder, not hide behind it.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave programme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave programme because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
A mining tycoon litigating over the payment of a $6 million tax bill on coal made the claim when he tried to brush aside the question of whether he had a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which will play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He has been given a big conflict of interest in terms of paid parental leave because if any of his daughters became pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting parental leave," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the race for a seat for Fairfax in the Sunshine Coast district with 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after polling stations close?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, type the details into the computer, vote immediately and have the results at half past seven in the evening?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is that the results can be erased if someone does not like it?
These days and in this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda extended to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
Public office is a service to the public.
"We are not seeking any reward except to serve society at this critical time," he said.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the upcoming effective date of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporations Act on 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the business representatives surveyed said that they had not addressed issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
These are the results of a survey conducted by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With the two key codes approaching effective dates, it is only now at the last minute that many managers are beginning to realize how they can have a significant impact on their companies' business.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the manoeuvring of politicians, the business sector lived for a long time in uncertainty about whether or not revolutionary changes would eventually take place.
"However, they now have only a few weeks left to ensure that the transition to the new law takes place without complications for their companies," commented Jan Spáčil, Partner at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies heavily involved in the new codes, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of companies of this number plan to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the other hand, every fifth company has not yet dealt with recodifications, but they still have a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and are unable to assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet addressed matters related to recodifications.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code for the largest number of companies surveyed is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent) and changes in the land register and liability for damage (ten percent each).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the entire recodification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Codes will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom in the arrangement of relationships," said Lukáš Poddaný, attorney-at-law at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In connection with the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
This is followed by topics related to changes in the convening and conduct of general meetings (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means stricter obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is threatened with bankruptcy or gets into bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if members of boards of directors and company executives do not act with due managerial care and do not avert the imminent bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit obtained for the performance of their office only for the last two years," Spáčil added.
NSA revelations increase social paranoia of state surveillance
One peaceful day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the US Advance Patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and the action triggered an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and German foreign ministers.
In September, James Clapper, America's director of national intelligence, again insisted that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of American companies in order to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But ever since Edward Snowden, who went from collaborator to whistleblower, began to reveal his valuable collection of secret surveillance by the United States, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director's words.
Following reports that the US National Security Agency spied on a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data held by US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, widespread paranoia about state surveillance has reached new heights.
The final straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by EY, German companies believe that the US now poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
However, in all the documentation revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is still no evidence that the United States passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policymakers expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and said it should try to reduce its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should produce a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies uncovered by Snowden is nonetheless shocking to some companies, who until now thought China posed the greatest surveillance threat.
There is a major turnaround in cloud computing, with European leaders realizing more widely that data stored in the U.S. falls under U.S. jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the discovery of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says, "We have a new question for customers that wasn't there a year ago – where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many senior German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets, and that this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is no surprise.
It's always been happening.
"This has been a fundamental topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we spy on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to brag about the countermeasures they've taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been reminded that taking a free USB memory stick at a trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is unwise to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at Audi, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk that smartphones may be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific areas.
"SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect company secrets against unauthorised access," warns the BfV in its report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate listed France in the second line of perpetrators who engage in hacking activities for economic intelligence after China, alongside Russia and Israel.
A board member at Germany's risk-free company concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
New nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests need to be done before human trials take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome all current approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry the genetic information to make antinicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests of vaccinated mice that were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren't vaccinated "calmed down," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often as to maintain adequate levels of antibodies, so they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because they turn liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
However, smokers would be much more likely to use it to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any benefit from the nicotine vaccine, and this will help them get rid of the habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.
The Desperate Cry of an Obama Voter
I voted for Obama twice – I shared hope for possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have been derailed by the Republican Party's filibuster
Obstructive politics cannot excuse the woes of Obama's health care website or drone strikes
The memoirs of the Obama campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is in his second year of medical school at Harvard.
These days I read a terribly sad book.
This book I thought would encourage me and restore a glimmer of hope during the gloomy days of my sophomore year in medical school.
It's called "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in an overwhelming majority, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of the moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
At his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic days – they seem distant memories, sad reminders of missed opportunities.
In the years after I cast my first ballot, there were indeed changes.
It was definitely not anything I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, and the end of the "ask no questions, say nothing" policy to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstruction has reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, public choice for health care, and the closure of the Guantánamo base, among others.
But after many situations defending the Obama administration from colleagues and comrades, I have reached the absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain consent to eavesdropping on foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, or that it persecutes those who expose government misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process, or for limiting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the report's finding that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration".
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if this was to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power might conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Clearly, elected office does not have a predictable course, and our public conversations will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above appear to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unpolished alternative, and seemed unable to consolidate his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had once heard about.
Yet going back to 2008 – with support for Obama plummeting below 45% this week – is getting harder and harder through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they needed to get back up to speed and stay true to their mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Sales and marketing of ŠkoFIN is led by Abrahámek
His responsibilities include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luděk Šantora.
Abraham has spent the last 14 years of his professional career in the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last place of work was Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of Automotive Division Manager for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was founded in 1992.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production assets, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the Committee on Global Chemical Weapons Oversight said on Thursday, as fierce conflicts erupted in the north of the country, near one of the places where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 residents had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the term set by the Hague-based organisation for Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of generating poisonous gas and refuelling munitions.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and repositories, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
A group of activists that monitored the total death toll through a network of activists in Syria reported on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are believed to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side has to be 29 954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Among those killed are 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, in Safira for weeks.
The observatory said Thursday that casualties were on both sides but did not have specific figures.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who face tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal amid the ongoing civil war.
In a statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, it said his team was now "satisfied that it has verified – and monitored the destruction – Syria's declared critical manufacturing and blending equipment."
He added that "no further inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been "abandoned and ... The chemical weapons program items it contained were moved to two other declared locations that were checked."
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.
"I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in carrying out this most challenging mission this organization has ever had," Observer Director Ahmet Uzumcu said in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the civil war pits mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said that on Wednesday there was a powerful explosion inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria ushers in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom chief said.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the riskiness of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
Once the project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is due to begin in other downstream countries later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early puberty: Mature earlier
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind it
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's pubic hair starts growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics' annual conference in Orlando, Florida, this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent the new normal.
"I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that it wasn't usually a sign of rapid progression toward full puberty," Kaplowitz said
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair, and body odour, appear earlier in girls.
Over the past forty years, however, there has been little shift in the age at which menstruation first occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts start to develop, at least two to three years pass before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
The most reliable test of how puberty will progress is time.
It is debated what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "precocious".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – something pediatricians can monitor closely.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to take tests to rule out serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which eventually can lead to the cessation of growth and dwarfism in adulthood.
Recommendations on drugs and hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but acknowledges that "suppressing puberty can alleviate problems with a girl's behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers."
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have periods.
"They're worried that she might get pregnant or how she's going to handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls ages 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are varied.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys develop facial and pubic hair at a young age, the trend towards full bloom of early puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls.
Other physicians attending the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) conference added further complexities to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child's doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you expect," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child is likely to respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if it happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Qamoun.
According to ever-increasing reports, Israel destroyed Hezbollah rockets in airstrikes on two locations in western Syria on Wednesday.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has clearly stated that it will prevent the transfer of equipment to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria on Wednesday are still being clarified.
Israel has not commented on the attack, but it has been confirmed by US sources.
According to the Syrian website, Dampress.com missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea hit the Syrian missile base Snubar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station said two warehouses were hit where the rockets were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria was constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force was teaching members of Hezbollah's armed section how to handle rockets.
SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 80s.
They are located on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, due to their mobility and small size, it is possible to hide them easily.
They are equipped with a radar, but it turns off after firing a missile, making it difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping protect Syria's Shiite community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now his 15,000 fighters are reportedly ready to help the army retake Qalamoun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also reinforcing its troops there.
Qalamoun lies between Damascus and the country's third largest city, Homs.
The battle is supposed to be in retaliation for the recent opposition attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus, according to the source al-Arabiya.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army retake the town of Qusayr near the Lebanese border earlier this year.
Many of Qusayr's rebels went to Qalamoun.
It argues that Maliki has played a large role in the resurgence of sectarian violence in Iraq, which he says is partly due to fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka negotiates on behalf of ČSSD.
The Social Democrats are crumbling, the Christian Democrats and the Babiš are talking to each other and preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners who will put on the table a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The CSSD envoys will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or give a nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka stumbled for the first time after four days of riding a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday he failed to control the political board and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
So far, only he is the confirmed negotiator for the party, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I have apologised to the members of the committee and now to the citizens.
One should not lie, in one's personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek said after the meeting of the Social Democrats' top leadership.
He added that he was not clinging to the post of first vice-president.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at the Central Committee," Hasek said.
ČSSD vice-chairman Zdeněk Škromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jeroným Tejc spoke similarly.
However, he pointed out that he had been elected just two days ago.
Both deputies then declared that they would do everything possible to ensure that the fifty-member ČSSD club sounded with one voice.
Michal Hašek crowned the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I respected the decisions of the party bodies."
So another lie in the live broadcast.
Or perhaps when calling for Sobotka's resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August Central Committee with 57 percent of the vote decided that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, by convening the Central Committee for the next Sunday, created a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a bunch of gossip and rumors, or to recall the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be a lot of washing of dirty laundry, hints of dark alliances between coal baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing will appear.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes bubble up in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
The words of Ostrava Mayor and Sobotka's ally Petr Kajnar are alarming: "I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots."
If the Central Committee had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced into ritual sacrifice of their functions.
Traitors sprinkle ashes on their heads and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is urgently starting work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN summit on sustainable development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to "rise above national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision of the SDGs building on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft of the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one.
The chairman of ANO admitted this in an interview for Pravo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised an environmental Olympics, his plan is thwarted by giant secret dumps
Winter sports fans are already cutting the yardstick until the opening of the Sochi Olympics, while others are looking at their preparation with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, although they do not start until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to fulfill their promise that the preparations and holding of the Games will not disturb the nature of Krasnodar Krai in the foothills of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had set the bar very high, the Canadian Games entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to holding the "zero waste" games seems long since over.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant dump of building materials in the village of Akhshtyr, near Sochi.
A landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foams was found by environmentalists in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities repented and the dump disappeared.
But only for a while.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, several such places have been created in the area, the British newspaper The Times described.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly that is building a roughly sixty-kilometer road between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort, is working on the site.
The enterprise, which has already swallowed up 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways defended themselves by saying that the landfill had been set up by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to residents of Akhshtyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymta River, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here will contaminate the Sochi water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental NGO EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal dumps are not the only problem for Russia's organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics cost $43 billion.
Last year's London Games cost only $19 billion, and Vancouver's nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will eventually be enough snow, there have also been reports that work on the construction of sports facilities and infrastructure does not respect human rights.
Last month, one of the workers sewed up his mouth in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers will deal with a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the Games.
Some visitors are planning to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in place in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will still have to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S. to ease regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies room to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight as long as the devices remain in "aviation" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are exploring the decision, which requires a lot of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no plans to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had looked into the notice, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its inflight entertainment wi-fi system, was in favour of the change but said it would abide by the regulator's decision.
"We would appreciate it if CASA would analyse the permission to use electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless inflight entertainment)," the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon," he said.
FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly concerned about regulatory developments that may be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of U.S. air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from airline to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate mobile phone radio interference, as well as review manuals, training material, carry-on baggage programmes and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew shall instruct passengers to switch off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the overhead stowage compartment during takeoff and descent.
There is nonsense in Gravity, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
The fantastic film from space, Gravity, sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers in October and earned over CZK 26 million.
Most reviews rate the film positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
Lidovky.cz asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they had noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity is no exception, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock's hair, which somehow does not float in weightlessness.
The Hubb Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in the same frame.
Some viewers of the film reproach the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of fire in weightlessness.
Spacesuits would also not withstand such blows, they say.
The heroes in the film Gravity often collide with various objects, and the suits can withstand everything without much difficulty.
The plot was not spared criticism either.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some discussants.
In addition, he wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the equipment.
People also argue on forums about "unreal" rope behavior.
It is said to look as if it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can definitely say that I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but science fiction.
And with such a story, the author has the right (almost the duty) not to stick consistently to reality.
"More than the discrepancies you mentioned, I was touched by the three times shown of a space station with a degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese)."
"After all, it won't be Chinese until the end of the decade, and it will probably look better than it does in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to violate the laws of physics, and so the natural-science oriented viewer will appreciate that the angular momentum is quite correctly preserved during various cosmic collisions and collisions, in the words of a physicist, also the view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the aurora flickering in the polar regions.
Inconsistencies will certainly be found on closer examination.
Additionally, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of orbit of various space debris appears in some scenes to be reversed than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and blatant offense against logic or natural laws in the film, and in comparison with other films of similar focus, it can be seen that the creators took care of the credibility of the depicted events.
Among the moments that don't make sense, it's worth mentioning that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different inclined orbit than the ISS.
As a result, the speed between them is very different, and the rescue operation could not actually have taken place as depicted in the film.
Furthermore, when Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) separated, I did not notice that the entire ISS rotated, so the origin of the force acting on Kowalski that forces both actors to let go when they are no longer moving relative to each other is not clear.
Bombardier's profit plummeted due to declining deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a fifteen percent drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer an update on whether the aircraft will stick to its ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results fell short of estimates, and shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell 8 percent.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the state-owned bank, downgraded the rating from "higher profitability" to "sector performance" on Thursday, expecting the stock market to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, we were significantly disappointed by the profit margin in the transportation sector," Doerksen said in a note to clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism towards this program to increase.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries will fight their way into the lower end of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177 as potential buyers await the results of the test flight to verify the company's claims regarding low fuel consumption and cost savings on this airliner.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft enters commercial use.
Executives also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was progressing as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier says it has been evaluating its commissioning plan and will provide updates in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – while in line with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ended September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover marginally decreased from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered just 45 planes during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Outstanding orders in the aviation division amounted to EUR 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which remains unchanged as of 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said revenue in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Outstanding transport orders amounted to EUR 32.6 billion as of 30 September, a marginal increase compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Executives said new outlooks will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil's Embraer SA, Bombardier's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and closest competitor, reported a ten percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Mick Jagger says he didn't go after the then 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard."
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with the rock veteran and he went after her.
She added: "That was a long time ago and now he is very nice to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's representative, 70, said he categorically denied ever making Katy Perry suggestions.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted this week at number one.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is appalling news, and it is fair to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, chief executive of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the world's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and ask him to reject this bill and return it to the lawmakers," he said.
According to the Star, the bill effectively gives the government "complete control of the media," and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have been "dealt a severe blow" and criticized the bill as "severe."
The bill's passage comes amid a series of measures aimed at bolstering national security in the wake of an attack by an Islamic shooter in the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media drew their ire to the authorities' anger when they broadcast security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media official for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of being "delisted" or denied official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to shut down most radio stations."
It is also reported that these measures can have a devastating impact on what Kenya's "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"You never know what can happen," wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have come under public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to repeal the national wage agency's cuts and restore their fat salaries of around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, ranking among the highest in the world.
Tax on foreign property owners bursts London bubble
The Treasury has given a preliminary assessment of the income tax on financial assets but is awaiting a final decision by Mr Osborne, who introduced in the 2012 budget a 7% property transfer fee for buildings over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own property within the company rather than as individuals.
The proceeds of the property transfer fee in the housing stock in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea counties, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceed the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Given the increase in property transfers in high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of the outdated poll tax system."
He added that "the move may have made some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London, or that existing owners were reluctant to sell."
Leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the affluent belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have seen a record 11.8% increase over the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but have been overshadowed by a booming "home market" in which, according to Savills survey, the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) experienced increases.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform at the city's Hydro complex on Friday.
However, the illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to postpone the show.
The group's announcement came after they were similarly forced to postpone Thursday's show at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone today's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham, and following medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone their performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to perform."
Performances at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and performances at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
