Parliament did not support the amendment freeing Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian parliament rejected the proposal to cancel the section on the basis of which opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko was sentenced as part of the amendment to the criminal code.
The amendment, which would open the way to the release of the imprisoned ex-prime minister, was rejected by the deputies during the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly disadvantageous contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the court is to consider the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymoshenko describes the verdict as a political revenge by the regime, the trial also raised suspicions of the court&#39;s bias in the West.
The proposal to drop section 365 from the criminal code, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 deputies during the vote.
226 votes were needed for its approval.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, the Islamists will win the elections, but it is a question of whether they will be moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to Sharia customary law and we already have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the hand is cut off for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, potential apostates face execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would certainly not want.
However, our way of life is neither the only one, nor objectively the best, and most likely it would not suit, for example, the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters have always taken help from infidel dogs.
Their only excuse is that, from their point of view, the NATO airstrikes were not directed by some general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified with every successful intervention.
So when looking for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of a dictator without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
As a result, the problem of expelling the &quot;crusaders&quot; is no longer a problem for the locals.
But without the occupation, will the oil companies have Libyan black gold?
Quite possibly they won&#39;t, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
So if those followers of Sharia law don&#39;t stop us.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe became the focus of investors
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated quarter-on-quarter, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany&#39;s GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries revised data for the second quarter, in which Germany fared better than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), while France reported a slight decline of 0.1% ( the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated quarter-on-quarter and, according to the CZSO, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in the growth of the economy&#39;s performance.
The results are worse than analysts&#39; estimates.
Highlights:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year, but stagnated quarter-on-quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally adjusted data.
The economy of the eurozone and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts&#39; expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are also starting to feel the problems...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is worsening.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won 1:0 in Montenegro and are celebrating the promotion for 200 million
The football team managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 thanks to a great Czech and a beautiful goal by Petr Jiráček.
Czech football, with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from the home rematch and will not be missing again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion match in a detailed reportage.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team won 1:0 in Montenegro, thanks to the domestic disaster in the end, the great Czech and the hero Jiráček, and is celebrating the promotion to the European Championship.
Due to the precise defense of the Czech team, the Montenegrins only came under pressure in the second half.
The losers of the match were Damjanović and Vučinić, who missed two great chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year either, and a reward of around 200 million crowns will also arrive in the coffers of domestic football.
A lot of combative football was played from the opening minutes.
Both teams had a hard time getting into a combination and the game was mostly played around the halfway line.
That&#39;s why the pressure of the home footballers did not come in the first half, as the Czech defense precisely deflected long kicks for defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country&#39;s nuclear program.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students formed a human shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express support for their country&#39;s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the building at noon on Tuesday and then called for the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Iran&#39;s Isfahan formed a human shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They thus show that they are ready to defend their country&#39;s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated in its recent report that Iran does not appear to have stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities.
Students prayed before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility at noon and then chanted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran&#39;s nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, in addition to the Isfahan center, the facility in Natanz, where uranium is enriched, would also be targeted.
An obese child&#39;s menu: he does not eat sausages for breakfast and dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent of children being obese.
At the same time, obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as the current survey showed.
It is again shown how important the environment in which he grows up and the patterns he is surrounded by are for the healthy development of a person.
For example, sausages appear on the tables of obese children up to half as often as in families of children of normal weight.
It is no coincidence that more than 19 percent of obese people had fried chips for dinner the day before the research linked to the awareness campaign called Obesity is not a coincidence.
In fat families, it is also not customary to do sports, which of course applies to most families of today&#39;s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and almost 900 children from elementary schools from all over the Czech Republic took part in it.
It was already the second year of the event Obesity is not a coincidence, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have participated in the project.
At the same time, proper nutrition and sufficient exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes the dramatically increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
&quot;For example, only half of the respondents stated that they eat five times a day in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,&quot; reads one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and sausage in the evening
Experts point out that even relative details are important for healthy development, including, for example, regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of schoolchildren&#39;s families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing was the discovery that a tenth of households do not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy French fries are consumed much more often in families with obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly play sports, the result for their parents was less than half that - 15 percent.
Create your menu
The next part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own menu from the offered options according to their own taste and opinion.
&quot;The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition.&quot;
Their favorite foods include a lot of floury, meaty and sweet foods.
&quot;The great popularity of sweet sodas is particularly alarming,&quot; the final survey report states.
For lunch, pasta won just over poultry as the main course.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and vegetable midday meals is also low.
Leaning towards health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they receive the right information.
&quot;In the control group of survey participants who filled out the questionnaire after the educational lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition,&quot; the project results state.
It was striking, for example, with sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer plain water.
Children also marked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day much more frequently in the questionnaire and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the pros
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained a bit that there was already a lot to do in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what would follow.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how things work on the set.
And it will get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really &quot;busy&quot;.
This time, the director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And the vast majority are like that.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips on how to emphasize the figure nicely for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. larger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, and at the same time not to dress the woman too provocatively.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not really fit, then it is worthwhile to have at least one such piece tailored.
You definitely won&#39;t regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than one that constantly shifts, rolls up, sticks out at the waist, etc.
A boyish character can afford to wear clothes with frills, applications, embroideries or gathers.
Of course, there is a lot of such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to organize all the information in my head.
And anyway, I&#39;m afraid that given the assigned homework, there&#39;s only so much to do.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity, for whom she has to come up with two outfits: day and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the given personality and body type.
I will be &quot;dressing&quot; Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria&#39;s Secret campaigns.
I&#39;m cheering in my heart, for me personally, definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained perhaps a hundred kilos (please consider the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out the clothes from magazines or look them up on the internet and print them out and then process them graphically.
Moodboard, as the entire result is called, then also expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic rendering.
It is also important to think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, for example, trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about it.
But only on Sunday.
A stylist must have a general overview
Saturday&#39;s lecture, full of information about character types, was enriched by three guests from the industry.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is key here.
For example, such a trench coat (or, if you prefer, a trench coat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on the bare body, put on pumps and take photos as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks different.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he emphasized.
But I appreciated the following advice the most: &quot;To work, you need to know the rules perfectly.&quot;
&quot;Then you can start breaking them,&quot; said Jakub.
Finally, it is clear to me why we are struggling with all the lessons, what to combine with what, for what, why, when we sometimes see something different even in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know again that a stylist must have many more options of clothes ready than the number of them that can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to &quot;stylize&quot; at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo the clothes look and work in combination with other pieces sometimes completely differently than in reality.
So we have to take that into account when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed to us that image and style sometimes make up to half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it unnecessary (after all, it&#39;s enough that I can do something, the way I look is secondary).
And if someone already has us create a styling, then we have to count on the fact that, with a high probability, they will dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than it really is.
Then all you have to do is google and find out if the tabloid wrote about the fact that the given celebrity gained/lost weight and the like.
On Sunday, both Honza and Mario told us that it is not enough for a stylist to be familiar with fashion and know how to put together an outfit.
In his work, he mainly communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to condescend, to stand up for one&#39;s opinion.
&quot;When a manager commissions you to sort through her wardrobe and add nice pieces to it, you can&#39;t throw out her entire closet and say, oh my god, that&#39;s terrible.&quot;
&quot;Find at least a few things in there that you compliment and recommend what they can be worn with,&quot; says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called &quot;placovka&quot;, or bag for the plot, must contain.
It is the one that you fasten around your waist and have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, a hair roller or safety pins, there is also nylon thread (with which the stylist helps when taking photos of products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which we fasten the clothes at the back if they are larger (pin or other clamps are not permissible, they would damage the garment), or sewing kit.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outdoors.
And so we glued and glued.
We mustn&#39;t even touch the shoes with the scissors, so they don&#39;t get damaged by accident.
So it really takes skill.
Mario pleased me when he unreservedly praised my creation.
The aforementioned skill is really not my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend continuation of the course.
It&#39;s becoming more and more clear to me that styling at a professional level really isn&#39;t a cakewalk, no matter what anyone wants to say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you race across America.
Review
An initially carefree ride turns into a routine morning shift trip due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes.
Although the ambition was fulfilled to a large extent, it is of no use when no one clearly wanted to do anything extra.
The new volume, subtitled The Run, raised high expectations before its release.
He promised to take the old racing series Need for Speed a bit in a new direction, and from the playable samples it seemed like a game that might not be just a number in the action racing genre.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages in which the main character gets out of the car and runs around will turn out.
But as is usual with the NFS series, many things are a little different than we expected.
It&#39;s a potentially decent arcade race, but the whole thing is dragged down by a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for more or less a few years now.
So these are not actually errors, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story in which the main character, Jack, has some personal problems and the solution is to participate in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to arrive in New York first.
The idea carries with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the given stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
So you don&#39;t feel for a moment that the game offers the same thing all the time.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it&#39;s nothing world-shattering.
But driving across the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasing.
In addition, the races are from time to time spiced up with some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well seeded one after the other.
There are only a few types, but that&#39;s enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the required number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then you catch up with time again (a classic fight with a stopwatch) and then a duel with a single opponent awaits you.
The police also get involved from time to time, making your efforts even more unpleasant.
Passages outside the car are new.
It&#39;s more like interactive animations where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But surprisingly, there are much fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (specifically, maybe even only three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above, it is thus classified as an element that adds variety to the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is certainly not much nowadays, but it cannot be said that it is a negative.
If you&#39;re looking for a realistic simulation, you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere.
But the driving model here still suits the more action-oriented racing quite well, even though we could find better ones from the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
But problems start to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not very good.
We don&#39;t expect a game of this type to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but when you practically have no idea how your car will behave before hitting any object, then everything is probably not quite right.
Typically when overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic you will sometimes only lightly lick each other, but other times in an almost identical situation your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even straight up.
Thanks to the system of restarts, it doesn&#39;t really bother you, but it will reliably upset you.
Restarts are handled in such a way that if you crash or go far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last waypoint on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race all over again.
So it&#39;s more like a tool in case something goes wrong, rather than something you can rely on outright.
But sometimes even restarts do not help, they are solved only by the need to learn the given section of the race by heart.
The game&#39;s big ailment is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply cannot fit into them.
At other times, you will meet &quot;civilian&quot; cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It gets annoying especially in situations where you see how your opponent easily passes between two oncoming cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around them or brake.
It doesn&#39;t matter when you reach them, because it is &quot;calculated&quot; so that the given situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
During the entire game, you will come across several places where, again regardless of time, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place.
It hits the hardest at the end of the game on the long bridge where you&#39;re driving in the opposite direction.
The adversary must obviously get there before you at any cost.
When it drives in front of you, it makes your view of the oncoming cars worse, so at first you probably have to spread out a few times.
One can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-filled, but the execution is so obvious that it reliably bores you quickly.
And it&#39;s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the gameplay is fun and sometimes so action-packed that sometimes you literally can&#39;t keep track of where things are flying.
And it doesn&#39;t really matter whether the concept with fifty unique tracks, the arrangement of the races so that boredom has no chance, or anything else is the merit.
An unconventional idea is to change cars during the races.
You have to watch out for roadside gas stations because that&#39;s where you can change your car, although in the vast majority of cases you&#39;ll be fine with what you have now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American wreckers for straight highways and exotic super sports for technical riding, for example on winding mountain roads.
The main story mode also goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is common to challenges and story.
As you get a higher driver level, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car, you get to the subway tunnel (maybe), where you drive it along the tracks in the dark (maybe).
The numbers between 150 and 200 km/h flash on the speedometer (so be it) and at that a subway train comes up from behind and ruthlessly destroys you.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a discussion for a few more days about whether nobody really thought at all when creating the game, or whether the authors really think we are such big fools.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It freezes in such a way that in some of the more tense moments the shooting drops, and in some cases quite tragically.
But it mainly applies to crash events with a larger number of participants, when you would not be able to take smooth pictures anyway.
The sound side is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the &quot;every dog is a different village&quot; category was created, but it can be assumed that no one will buy the game simply because of listening to the music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is thus considerably embarrassed.
If the game had avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game feels unfinished.
It&#39;s definitely fun, but be prepared for the bugs to be glaring at you with the force of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics
&quot;The Treaty of Lisbon significantly disturbed the balance between the individual institutions.&quot;
“I didn&#39;t expect it to be such a hard war.
&quot;It will take five or six years for the situation to stabilize a bit, to calm down and for all the players to get used to their new roles,&quot; Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law sharply.
She showed how seriously she takes her motto &quot;Clearly and openly about Europe&quot; already in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relationships in such a clear and comprehensible way that many lecturers from the Law Faculty of the UK could envy her.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
&quot;At first there was criticism that he was bland, that he was a gray official, that he couldn&#39;t fulfill any role, and I have to say that it took everyone&#39;s breath away that he played that role excellently.&quot;
&quot;He is a person who knows how to listen to the twenty-seven member states, communicates well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.&quot;
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: &quot;Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?&quot;, i.e. as an important step towards the unification and greater legibility of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban cheeseburgers
Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She described the previous Czech presidency as a success.
The Czechs solved the coming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government at this time as a big negative that severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being solved today, was a &quot;fact frmol&quot;.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is greatly complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and economical, which sectors will get priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, all this is on the agenda of the next meetings.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: &quot;About Europe intelligibly&quot;.
&quot;I really don&#39;t like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, gibberish that no one understands.
How is a citizen to understand that curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes are not really invented in Brussels, or that someone really has to ban cheese curds.&quot;
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, for example the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
&quot;Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say: &quot;Look, what are you meeting there, what about your Visegrad Four?&quot; and he doesn&#39;t look enthusiastic at all.&quot;
In the future, according to Vicenová, the Union mainly faces new tough rules for the budget policies of member countries.
He perceives the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new &quot;European federation&quot; as very real.
&quot;We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone.&quot;
&quot;We have the Schengen area, we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation.&quot;
&quot;It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don&#39;t want to stay away.&quot;
&quot;There will be more of those institutes and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe,&quot; Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all topics that have an impact on the entire Union should be discussed between all member states, not just between the eurozone countries.

If someone were looking for a word that most accurately expresses IBM&#39;s strategy, the closest would probably be &quot;long-term&quot;.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the slogan that many of the world&#39;s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His catchphrase &quot;Think!&quot; thus became the imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold (and also the name of the internal magazine that began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson&#39;s carefully constructed corporate culture.
&quot;For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a century because it stayed true to its core values while not being afraid to change everything else around it.
This has allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will be able to achieve even more in the second century,&quot; commented the company&#39;s current director, Samuel J. Palmisano, on the occasion of the anniversary.
A sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in the same way as entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IBM, as one of the first American employees, had paid vacations, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM&#39;s relationship with the customer has been just as elaborate for a long time.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant at extracting talent - as one of the first companies in the world to abolish any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisano to be replaced at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, until now she holds the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called jams, online brainstorming sessions, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that there are plenty of ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
An institution with a good name
A firm position in business is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
&quot;From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,&quot; Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter told the Economist.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,&quot; added George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and directly creating the market.
IBM - or &quot;Big Blue&quot;, as it is familiarly nicknamed in the United States due to its logo - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a bar code or a floppy disk.
At roughly $220 billion, IBM became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (after Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of customers and the times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers.
&quot;If your business is built on moving forward, you can&#39;t be emotionally attached to the past,&quot; notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That&#39;s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don&#39;t work, then abandon them.
Unlike competitor Microsoft, for example, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
Services account for the largest share of IBM&#39;s sales, with software and hardware accounting for roughly a fifth.
At the same time, even in 1990, hardware was the strongest representative with more than half of the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-performing assets, while investing $58 billion in the acquisition of promising technologies.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is following the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be coming through the current crisis unscathed.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has risen by a rocket 120 percent, the company&#39;s net profit is continuously growing.
IBM&#39;s corporate motto is to change everything but your values.
It can therefore be expected that even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will handle it.
History of IBM: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally with the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand used for the company&#39;s branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the famous &quot;picháčky&quot;, i.e. clocks recording the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company&#39;s supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - an invincible corporate culture and identity are still built on Watson&#39;s ideas.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson was the head of the company, the turnover doubled to nine million dollars and the extensive expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that, after almost forty years, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, replaced him in the executive chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the people and computers of IBM helped NASA manage space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic &quot;little one&quot; that set the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, it bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself fully to consulting and services with high added value.
A strategy that has paid off for IBM in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is the smart use of technology in areas that have not even been planned yet and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city administration.
For commerce, IBM recently introduced the &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; platform, which helps merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country as well.
It established its branch in what was then Czechoslovakia as early as 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM CR, there is also a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe headquarters are based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team working on voice recognition.
Rychtářová about an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don&#39;t want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from his rosy dream and return home.
But now she doesn&#39;t want to wait any longer and has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
&quot;Pepa can return home, but no longer as my partner,&quot; explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová gave asylum to Bartoš in her home in the summer, she apparently had no idea how her marriage would eventually end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, seemingly reconciled with her husband&#39;s relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytáre doesn&#39;t care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář were to break up with Bartošová, the open arms of his wife would not be waiting for him at home.
&quot;He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live out his life in our shared home, no one will kick him out.&quot;
&quot;However, she will live to see him not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties,&quot; revealed Rychtářová, adding that she has already detached herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Josef doesn&#39;t mind Darina closing the back door on him yet.
&quot;I respect my wife&#39;s decision.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll be with Iveta and I&#39;m not going to change that.&quot;
“The wife set up a paper marriage and I respect that.
&quot;The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, real estate, I shop.&quot;
&quot;Darina and I talk normally, it&#39;s just that we don&#39;t share a bed,&quot; Rychtář told Blesku.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, he would not prevent her from doing so.
&quot;We don&#39;t sleep together and I don&#39;t care where she goes, who she goes with or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it&#39;s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility,&quot; concluded Josef.
The worst female vices: Do they apply to you too?
If you ask men if they could list any typical female vices, they are usually all very quick to spill them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where several female vices are listed that can perfectly pump up the blood in men&#39;s veins?
Shopping
Does your significant other blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to buy in bulk at discounts?
Then in your case you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least curb their shopping passion.
But tell me, who could resist just wandering around clothing stores, looking for tops that fit well, and then trying them all on (ideally in different colors) in a booth?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, it can become absolute hell for men.
Just remember how many times you have already told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
&quot;Am I not too fat?&quot;
&quot;I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?&quot;
&quot;Do you like me at all?&quot;
Don&#39;t these sentences remind you of something?
Right?
Then you are one of those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are downright allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It&#39;s like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping the floor, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on a clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying the scrubbed sink and covering the glass living room wall that you spent so much time polishing?
If you suffer from this &quot;defect&quot;, try to realize that nothing should be overdone and order and cleanliness should definitely not come first in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships and family well-being.
Digging
&quot;Throw those used shorts in the trash.&quot;
&quot;Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow, too?&quot;
&quot;A wet towel doesn&#39;t belong on the floor.&quot;
If you dig into your partner like this several times a day, know that you can reliably turn them off.
Of course, you don&#39;t mean it in any bad way, you just want to make sure everything is fine.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn&#39;t have to dig into them so much...
Gossip, gossip
For some women, slander, gossip, but also insults and ganging up against someone are characteristic.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a little harmless gossip or slander here and there.
Hand on heart, it is characteristic of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossips of the coarsest grain, who like to gossip and often, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous for those around them - especially within the female work team.
Jagr and Voracek helped Philadelphia win with assists
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated in Monday&#39;s NHL game with two assists in Philadelphia&#39;s 5:3 victory on the ice of Carolina and is once again at the head of the Czech players&#39; productivity in the competition.
Claude Giroux benefited from the overview of the 39-year-old star in both cases, who added one more pass and was named the best player of the match.
Jágr&#39;s teammate Jakub Voráček also scored two assists in the match.
Jagr claimed to overseas reporters after the game that he predicted a big night for Giroux.
&quot;I already told him before the match that he would score a hat-trick.&quot;
“I felt it.
&quot;Sometimes you get that feeling,&quot; explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored on the Flyers&#39; first shot.
Moments later, the team&#39;s second hit also had a Czech touch.
Voracek won the puck behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the circles to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer reduced the deficit, but the beginning of the second half belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically, Giroux.
After working with Jágr, he scored the third goal, then his shot was converted into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I love playing with him.
&quot;I don&#39;t want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he is definitely among the top three,&quot; Jágr praised his center.
&quot;I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m happy about that.&quot;
&quot;I want to play him.&quot;
&quot;All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play on me, now it&#39;s turning around,&quot; Jágr added.
Carolina made the match even more dramatic, with a goal by Tuom Ruutu and Dwyer again, who won from a free kick, to reach a one-goal difference.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, who ended the renumbering two to one.
“He hit great in our Pronger zone.
“He poked the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) drove to the far post.
&quot;I tried to hit him and I&#39;m glad that it worked,&quot; said Voráček, describing the last goal of the match from his point of view.
With the victory, Philadelphia moved to the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal&#39;s Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo, he withdrew in the second period due to an upper body injury.
In addition to the experienced defender, the Candiens also lost a two-goal lead and lost after a penalty shootout 2:3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomáš Plekanec.
Rather than the lost points, the home coach was saddened by the wide-ranging destruction of the back rows, while they finished the match with only five defenders.
&quot;It is bad.&quot;
&quot;We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were youngsters.&quot;
&quot;But there&#39;s nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Change after change, it came at us and we couldn&#39;t resist.
&quot;We should have simplified the game more, moved the puck out of our zone.&quot;
We had gaps in that,&quot; added one of PK Subban&#39;s defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty saves to Winnipeg&#39;s 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
Five different scorers shared the goals for the Jets, who snapped a five-game losing streak.
How tour prices have developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in what was then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies sold overwhelmingly only tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both near the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton) on vacation by the sea.
The clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia as well, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies also offered tours to the West, but you had to stand in line overnight with a sleeping bag or have &quot;good friends&quot; at the travel agency.
However, it was not won.
The so-called the foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for trips to the West, was not granted to &quot;politically unreliable people&quot;, who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the trip to the West without a foreign exchange promise.
By far, however, Czechs most often spent their holidays in their own country, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that Czechs bought and this custom survives to this day.
Since 1989, Czech travel has experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989, holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to Croatia, currently the most popular for us, until 1989, as it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the visa requirement for neighboring Western European countries was abolished, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria&#39;s Vienna and Germany.
For a long time, Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone wanted to see there at least for a while.
For example, in Paris, tours of Czechs slept in parks in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of traveling Czechs at this time was to bring their own food, canned food, salami, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally freely buy Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with it average salaries were rising, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies regularly began to prepare tours with chartered flights from 1997, making air travel incredibly cheap compared to the past thanks to the possibility of contracting volume discounts.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, Czechs already had visa-free travel to practically all developed countries in the world, except the USA, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in the year 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first ever direct charter flight to an exotic destination was dispatched from the Czech Republic, to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters have been flying with Czech tourists to warm distant countries every year, this winter there will be direct flights from the Czech Republic to already twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs per year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the USA canceled visas for Czech tourists and thus our country was definitively ranked among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 CZK on one foreign vacation, including costs at the place of stay. CZK per person.
The general meeting is supposed to find a chairman, but there is a threat of stalemate again
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months and there is a threat that Ivan Hašek&#39;s successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which electoral procedure will be followed.
Without it, the voting on which of the three candidates will be elected will not even begin.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hašek resigned from his position in June and on his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hašek era, football slipped back to the pitfalls between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This became fully evident on September 16, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the general assembly went to the National House in Prague in Smíchov unnecessarily, because the meeting remained blocked and it was not just about the method of election.
There was not even an agreement on who actually has the right to vote at the meeting - whether only the statutory representatives, or also the officials authorized by the power of attorney.
On this single point, there has since been partial agreement, which was helped by the recommendation of the Institute for the State and Law, according to which representation based on a power of attorney is not possible.
However, there are still disputes regarding the electoral rules.
Even the executive committee did not bring too much clarity to the situation, which basically does not deal with anything else at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to eliminate the possibility of a heel?
&quot;The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or to find another model,&quot; stated one of the three vice-presidents of the FACR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the model proposed by the statutes, in the third round, the candidate with a greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is reportedly willing to make concessions so that the candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must obtain at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage count.
&quot;However, that would make the two previous rounds meaningless, it would completely negate the bicameral concept,&quot; he understands the objections of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclík somewhat surprisingly agrees with this, even though it is estimated that the electoral procedure determined by the statutes suits Pelt the most out of all the candidates.
&quot;I wish that the election would be based on the statutes as much as possible.&quot;
&quot;So that they don&#39;t come up with some vicarious nonsense like at the last general meeting,&quot; declared the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements was primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
According to him, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
&quot;All passions will be calmed by the eventual advancement of the national team to the European Championship today.&quot;
&quot;Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate,&quot; says the official from Jablonec, who has the most experience in managing football both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
&quot;I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very divided.&quot;
&quot;It is not among people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations on purpose.&quot;
“This may cause the AGM to be blocked again.
&quot;However, I hope common sense will prevail,&quot; Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for an agreement between all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete before the match.
The special flight in which vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to travel to Podgorica, among others, did not take off from Prague due to a technical fault in the morning, and an alternative option was sought to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
In the end, the meeting at the ministerial level, which can reportedly take place on Wednesday, may be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to make the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country come to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sports after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Pilsen football chief Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered the fight for the top job.
&quot;If there is a quality adept, I will fight for him and I will not go to the election.&quot;
&quot;But in the current situation, it was not possible to find anyone like that,&quot; Paclík told ČTK.
Paclík&#39;s motivation to fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from becoming the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that, in the event of his victory, he would last in the role of chairman only until 2013, when a regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced and top manager in the position, who is not too closely connected with football events.
“I&#39;ve talked to some people who might be considered.
&quot;It was crazy for me when some said that at the moment they don&#39;t even want to identify with Czech football.&quot;
&quot;I would like to change that view,&quot; he said.
According to Paclík, Pelt&#39;s connection with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general meeting, is now the most bothersome to Paclík.
For Paclík, it is so unacceptable for Pelta to stand in the position of chairman.
&quot;If he won, the current situation would be preserved and nothing would move forward in football.&quot;
&quot;Combined with the support of Berber, who is a good businessman, it would not benefit football even more,&quot; declared Paclík.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta&#39;s name was heard years ago in wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption affair, from which Pelta, however, escaped without punishment.
&quot;I don&#39;t know what prestige Pelt&#39;s victory would bring to football.&quot;
&quot;And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, who is now also taking his earlier statement that he would &quot;sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman&quot; with a grain of salt.
If Paclík were to triumph in Thursday&#39;s election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in fiasco, thinks the same way.
“He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to.
“He has great powers.
&quot;I could imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team.&quot;
&quot;But he wouldn&#39;t be able to run the association as a manager.&quot;
&quot;I also don&#39;t poke my nose where I can&#39;t do it,&quot; said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by being behind the dismissal of the referees&#39; commission headed by Luďek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims that he would dare to lead the association.
He refers to his abilities from the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated their first league triumph in May.
&quot;I have the power to change something in the football environment, to contribute to its certain cultivation.&quot;
&quot;In order to limit the influence of some interest groups, which, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals commission, which leads to disgusting situations,&quot; said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy towards, for example, Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider strengthening FAČR&#39;s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee to be one of his priorities, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to go into sports.
&quot;It&#39;s one of the key things the new chairman should address.&quot;
&quot;If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say frankly where the money will go,&quot; he noted.
Paclík does not even consider his association with the Pilsen club to be a burden, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be &quot;non-partisan&quot;.
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Prague&#39;s Dukla.
“It&#39;s not ideal.
&quot;But I don&#39;t even see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares in the Pilsen club to someone and returning there in a year and a half,&quot; said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would exclude an electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, if elected, he would advocate for the FAČR to have new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The official from Jablonec is optimistic before Thursday&#39;s meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election battle will significantly dampen the possible success of the national football team today.
Pelta already promised before the failed September election that he intends to focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the election before the last general meeting at the last minute, so the two-month delay could be useful for him to defend and present his ideas on football management in a wider context.
&quot;People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday.&quot;
&quot;He feels that it is high time for someone to lead the association,&quot; says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who worked for many years in Sparta and the union&#39;s executive committee.
This is also why he believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hašek.
&quot;Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, bylaws were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;
&quot;If they didn&#39;t allow for different interpretations, we would have had a chairman since September,&quot; Pelta pointed out.
He saw the revision of the most important document of the civic association as a trap for the delegates.
&quot;If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of principle that we cannot do without,&quot; Pelta claims.
He says he still tries not to define himself against his rivals.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchlo, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows very well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He didn&#39;t even attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who, on the other hand, didn&#39;t leave no stone unturned on Pelt.
&quot;He&#39;s been playing football for a little over a year, he&#39;s already had some success.&quot;
&quot;However, his attacks were undignified and caught a lot of people by surprise in the way he campaigned.&quot;
&quot;This is also why many of them now doubt his true character,&quot; Pelta said to his opponent, who is said to remain faithful to the proclamations he announced back in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a showcase for football.
&quot;And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the reverberations of last year&#39;s corruption scandal.&quot;
&quot;Immediately after that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sectors in order to secure enough money for the whole of football,&quot; the forty-six-year-old candidate told CTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personal purges.
&quot;I would first have to familiarize myself with the duties of the individual employees,&quot; he said to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness due to the long absence of government.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily on Thursday.
&quot;If the only point of contention is how the third round will be chosen, then we can get past that.&quot;
&quot;Football needs credibility, and it will only get it by finally having its leader again,&quot; Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that FAČR would start working hard under him
If current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl were elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday&#39;s general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants to push through systemic changes and make executive committee members responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue the work started by the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek.
&quot;As chairman, I would like to focus on football as a whole.&quot;
&quot;From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, professional football, performance football to youth.&quot;
&quot;However, this does not mean that I would do everything myself,&quot; said Rajchl in an interview for ČTK.
&quot;I am a team player and I want to distribute competences in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area.&quot;
&quot;And I will hand out hard tasks so that football moves a mile ahead in each of these segments.&quot;
&quot;It probably wouldn&#39;t make a lot of people happy, because you&#39;d start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,&quot; he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again.
&quot;I&#39;ve been known to work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know that it will be meaningful and that I won&#39;t have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question my every move,&quot; he explained why he hesitated.
&quot;But many people told me that I mustn&#39;t give up, because then others would give up too.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s a trust I can&#39;t just throw away,&quot; he said.
He is said to be motivated by continuing the work he started with Hašek.
&quot;A lot of work has been done in those two years and I don&#39;t want to throw it away now.&quot;
&quot;Processes have been started that will have reverberations for maybe a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them,&quot; he said, fearing that if the next candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the union could return to the time before Hague.
&quot;I believe in systematicity, and that&#39;s something that I don&#39;t think Mirek Pelta can do.&quot;
&quot;There are mainly people behind him who would make football so that it would only be for the chosen ones.&quot;
&quot;I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not for being partial to someone.&quot;
“I try to be objective.
&quot;I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will have a good time and not just the chosen ones,&quot; remarked Rajchl.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech president.
&quot;Even if some people try to claim the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league.&quot;
&quot;There wouldn&#39;t be the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia,&quot; said Rajchl.
As the head of the Pilsen club Tomáš Paclík joined the fight for the chairmanship, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
&quot;However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that I have clear successes behind me,&quot; said Rajchl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery the law.
On the contrary, he blames himself for the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he declares about Pelt that he is &quot;disqualified from restoring trust to Czech football&quot;, he considers the other opponent, Paclík, to be a strong candidate who has a lot to offer football.
&quot;Nobody can dispute that he did a great job in Pilsen that year.&quot;
&quot;If he were to be elected, he would hopefully continue the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions.&quot;
&quot;He wouldn&#39;t want to twist it to his advantage,&quot; Rajchl evaluates his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
Paddling pool from the perspective of Ufon, a luxurious pool in Budapest: Those traveling in Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after sightseeing or traveling let their tired feet rest in the thermal spa.
The book will show you where wellness by the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a journey of discovery in the past year and a half, her luggage couldn&#39;t be missing: her swimsuit.
Lying prone on the water, she looked up at the artistically shaped domes, swam towards the marble putti (figures of a small naked boy, child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored art nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she entered it in her notebook in an instant - with remarkable details about the construction method and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presents them in her just-published book &quot;Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) &quot;: Folk swimming pools in Munich, historic swimming pool palaces in the Black Forest, &quot;The hard core of concrete structures&quot; in the Taunus.
Her &quot;Journey to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe&quot; led her through 13 countries: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia .
The 46-year-old German woman is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It doesn&#39;t go too far with sports, Meder says - it&#39;s just something else in the water.
It&#39;s just infuriating that amateur swimming has to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners for health can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
&quot;One day I asked why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,&quot; says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
&quot;So I started collecting nice swimming pools.&quot;
The water surface doubles the architecture
Splashing in the plunge pool and essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much for Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor, one has a water surface in the spa.&quot;
&quot;It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building.&quot;
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, colorful stoves, diving boards.
The small-format picture volume &quot;Badefreuden (The joys of bathing)&quot; provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the swimming pool collector Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to wonderful healing spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found nitrate-rich water in an original karst cave (Cave Baths in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are housed in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful spectacle. While one can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, one can take a dip in the outdoor pool of the spa in St. Anton looking at the snow-covered Arlberg - a: There is a window in the steam bath from which you can watch the activity on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most striking pool design awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: the Ötztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, steam rises from the three open-top basins, while the Ötztal mountain rises to the sky in the background.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the smell of chlorine rise to the nostrils of pool collector Mrs. Meder.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, the Árpád Spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells of heating oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that one has reached a medical spa.
The smell comes from the healing alkaline bicarbonate water, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather strange wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
The spa designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovič in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
When Ms. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-white-and-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing massively between the tiles.
On the other hand, they faced extinction in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This spa has already completed three phases of construction; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that date back to its creation in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa spot for pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, and not just because it comes from the Black Forest.
&quot;It&#39;s quite a feat to combine such diverse building styles into such a wonderful complex,&quot; says Ms. Meder.
For such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is apparently a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank has commodities trading under review
Christian Teeves
Is Deutsche Bank exiting its agricultural commodities business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world&#39;s poor.
In January, the head of the concern wants to draw consequences from this.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate in agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world&#39;s poorest.
This is the result of the Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study builds on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices up and banks are therefore complicit in the world&#39;s hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer defenders is directed specifically against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have become detached from supply and demand - and have been making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to investigate the accusations and said that no business &quot;is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake&quot;.
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is checking the allegations from the Foodwatch-Report.
The review is due to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank&#39;s board of directors - along with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank&#39;s representatives want to announce what consequences they will draw.
In the end, there could be a reduction in trade in commodities or even a total rejection.
Ackermann works on his image by himself.
The head of the Foodwatch organization Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time intensified his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Betting on rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how ruthlessly the banks are harming the general welfare today.&quot;
Let Ackermann do his duty as the top banking lobbyist.
&quot;Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items where money is used for betting on food prices,&quot; Bode said.
&quot;I don&#39;t care if Mr. Ackermann cares about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
Ackermann&#39;s insight seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the concern would like to leave a perfect image a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors will not move to the supervisory board as planned.
By turning away from questionable agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn&#39;t have to worry about possible losses - his successor should deal with that in the end.
Every other person would cancel investments in raw materials
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization&#39;s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Accordingly, eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: One in two would, as a result of the survey, abandon all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would warn someone they know about such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switch to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with highs, lows and a happy ending: the Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into disrepair.
It is now being reopened as a show house.
When there is a clamor for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold expansions and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition of 1958 is a fitting and famous example.
Schwanzer&#39;s pavilion received the Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture at the time for its light and floating structure made of steel and glass.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous by building the Austrian pavilion for the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus a turnkey secondary building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
The pavilion designed as a temporary exhibition building was placed in the Schweizer Garten near Vienna&#39;s Südbahnhof (South Railway Station) after the World Exhibition, reconstructed and opened in 1962 as the Museum of the 20th Century - it was named &quot;House of the 20th Century&quot;.
But the building was not suitable for a museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and deteriorating more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, it is now called &quot;House of the 21st Century&quot; and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition there - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, made a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, including a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modernity, strongly pushed for the reconstruction with politicians and preservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a cafe and a bookstore should be created, and an office building had to be built for this.
Tight supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he sensitively reconstructed and expanded Joseph Olbrich&#39;s art nouveau buildings in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an &quot;extremely important place&quot; for him, where he viewed exhibitions &quot;almost every weekend&quot;.
He knew the original project and he also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness during its relocation to Vienna and change of use.
During the current reconstruction, there were far bigger problems: The building was a &quot;catapult for energy&quot;, says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, insulating glass reinforced with glass fibers was used, and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass.
The cold bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled ceilings were rehabilitated.
The two underground floors provided space for a new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - an almost new building, but still the lofty Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
And the movie theater is still exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the heritage office and a low budget.
&quot;Often, material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked by the heritage office,&quot; says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to be difficult with the pavilion, &quot;which came here from Brussels&quot;, said Krischanitz recently, a typical &quot;Drop-in-the-City-history&quot;.
Such architecture is said to be &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and yet wants to &quot;instill proper self-confidence&quot;.
In this case, however, the House of the 21st Century is not in an inappropriate place, because an urban lucky coincidence happened: In the circuit around Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed &quot;Urban Quarter near the Main Station&quot; with office and residential buildings is being built.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and is reportedly already in talks with the city about a site in the Schweizer Garten.
The railway is planning a package for the winter crisis in the amount of millions
The railway has drawn up a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
This will cost millions.
Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros more this year to combat winter-related train outages and delays, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; brought a preliminary report with reference to the internal group plan, that it is expected to invest a total of around 300 million euros by 2015.
It is said to be used to achieve better use of trains and the rail network even under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to clear the platform of snow and ice before the start of operations and 90 percent of the necessary switches for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, after a top-level meeting with government and industry representatives, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train outages and delays this winter as well.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, because, among other things, it had a lack of reserves in difficult weather conditions.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
Added to this is the delay in the departure of ICE trains
For years, the railway has also not been able to handle the fact that the axles of ICE trains apparently have to be inspected by the workshop more often, when an axle was destroyed on one ICE train at Köln Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays a million dollar fine in the US
After the commotion surrounding the head of Josef Ackermann, there is new trouble in the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank didn&#39;t already have enough problems at home, its past in the US caught up with the industry giant: The Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million (106 million euros) in a single settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage bonds.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of big banks of misleading co-operative banks into buying financial products with false promises; that the risks probably decreased.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the crisis and dragged the banks down with them into the abyss.
&quot;We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the need to drag the parties to court,&quot; said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any fault by settling.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged to pay 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the generosity of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. bank unions and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is trying to recover billions in damages.
The now concluded settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped down on other big banks, suing JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American real estate bubble burst in 2007, it was fatal for many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its thinking.
Although the events took place several years ago, the headwinds are now blowing against the banks.
Investors and regulators have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or sanctions for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 big international banks of putting two state-owned US real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at a disadvantage in mortgage deals worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also faces an FHFA lawsuit involving multiple deals totaling about $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The supervisory authority is demanding that the Frankfurt institute be responsible for &quot;substantial losses&quot;, without specifying an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the prominent American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies can only be predicted with difficulty.
But now he has read IBM&#39;s business reports and has changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Much earlier he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett&#39;s investment is considered knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the mother rock of IT IBM can now be called &quot;Sir IBM&quot;.
Because Buffett revealed on the American economic radio station CNBC that since March he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway thus became one of IBM&#39;s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his engagement until now.
He praised the management, which tried even for decent returns during the economic crisis.
&quot;You&#39;ve done a great job,&quot; Buffett said of the strategy.
For a long time, IBM has been betting on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computer centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has tended to avoid technology companies until today.
He claims that he only invests in businesses whose operations he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for a freight railroad, a lubricant manufacturer, or a machinery manufacturer.
His Berkshire Hathaway Holding, in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old man took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it with wise investments into one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unerring sense of money earned him the nickname &quot;The Oracle of Omaha&quot;.
As Buffett&#39;s investment became known, IBM shares rose 1 percent in premarket trading.
&quot;Big Blue&quot;, as IBM is also called, has a total market value of more than 220 billion dollars and is considered, together with Apple and Microsoft, to be the most valuable technology companies in the world.
However, Buffett would not want to join Microsoft.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his close friend.
The threat is palpable
After the revelation of the &quot;Cells in Zwickau&quot;, the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
Newspapers even talk about a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; that is now coming back to life.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
The news was met with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, this brings back a specter long thought dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been in doubt.
The discovered right-wing extremist network, however, reveals a scale whose dimensions have long been unforeseeable.
&quot;Bloody Ideology Resurgent?&quot; read the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
The &quot;Sabah&quot; newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been an undercover police agent of the Department for the Protection of the Constitution, and they fear that the German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical quagmire.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted cautiously: It remembered the victims of racist violence with a demonstration of silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement with a ceremony.
Life together was staged in cheerful colors - like a success story.
The coverage of several Turkish media acts as a box here: &quot;Germany&#39;s gift to the 50s&quot; is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot;, which reports on the background of the murder series.
Even the edition of the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; for Germany cannot fail to make this thought connection.
&quot;It&#39;s starting to stink&quot;, reads the headline of Ahmet Külahci&#39;s column.
In it, he emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work were murdered.
The procedure of the police and its late success in the search is discussed most critically in German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Thus, many show themselves, at least rhetorically, ready to use drastic measures: &quot;If the activities here continue to be carried out in such a superficial way, the immigrants will have nothing left but to defend themselves and arm themselves&quot;.
&quot;That will probably be the best self-defense&quot;.
&quot;The internal peace in Germany depends very strongly on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network&quot;, writes &quot;Selen&quot;.
The assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s make clear what it means if internal peace in Germany is threatened.
The photograph of the crematorium in Solingen is deeply etched in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a palpable threat here, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made the sense of reciprocity more apparent on the part of the Turks.
Don&#39;t repeat the mistakes of the past
The failure of German policy after the assassinations was mainly criticized in the Turkish press at the time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish state president, but at the funeral in Köln he was represented by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel - in his speech, Kinkel calculated what fees the local Turks were paying.
Pretty much as if a person&#39;s worth was measured by the amount of their taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep is the distrust of many German Turks in the local legal system.
In addition to efforts for extensive clarification and a new evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
The scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
Europe&#39;s most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now some German has to settle it.
Axel Weber certainly didn&#39;t think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he will start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: chairman of the board of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praising both Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and making friendly remarks toward future colleagues.
&quot;Die UBS achieves turnaround&quot;.
&quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;.
But already in September it was clear that everything would turn out completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all the bank&#39;s security systems and wasted around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Grübel, a banker recognized not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of UBS has also been scalded since then - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It will be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would certainly need time to get used to it.
He will then suddenly take over responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which just once again proved that it deserves the title &quot;Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe&quot;.
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been sliding from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared by the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a taciturn and solid but also shrewd asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a difference in investment banking.
Thus, in 2007, UBS managed, on the one hand, $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world&#39;s largest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time professor of banking in Zurich, recounts: &quot;At the time, I always presented UBS to my students as an example of a good bank.&quot;
&quot;Looking back today, one wonders: How could I have been so wrong?&quot;
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it first became apparent that something had gone seriously wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, the head of the board, Peter Wuffli, who until now was considered a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, it became clear why he had left.
The investment division of the bank squandered the Subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to withstand this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
But she did find investors, but ones she would have turned her nose up at recently: an opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign fund that was so discreet that you didn&#39;t even know its name.
But that was just the first bump.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to admit new losses of billions, the president of the board Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second best paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, disaster followed: UBS was on the brink of collapse due to its faulty investments during the financial crisis and had to be bailed out by the state.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions worth of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatorily convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such big banks on its territory.
After all, UBS&#39;s 2007 balance sheet total was more than five times the performance of Switzerland&#39;s economy (see figure).
&quot;Once again we could not save UBS&quot;, says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS capitulated to this in the tax dispute with America and showed a willingness to release the data of wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million - in return for unauthorized profits from these deals, including a penalty surcharge.
In doing so, UBS admitted more or less openly that it had facilitated tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board of directors and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in the course of a few months in both core business areas: In investment banking due to bad speculation and in wealth management for helping to reduce tax.
And just when things calmed down a bit again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, here comes this unfortunate business anabasis: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it&#39;s clear: risk management in investment banking is apparently still not working.
&quot;The Adoboli case probably shows that risk control has changed too little,&quot; says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz Professor of Finance at the University of Zurich&#39;s Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: &quot;The problem with UBS is that it does not manage to control risks.&quot;
At the same time, it was exactly the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers stepped out a long time ago to become guardians of the world&#39;s great assets: no too great risks, but safety for money - the world collapsed again from this side of the Alpine republic.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol for unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it&#39;s just a little bigger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich&#39;s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany&#39;s can be found here among traditional Swiss shops such as Sprüngli patisserie.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them there are massive leather chairs, next to the bank&#39;s logo there is a big sign to the &quot;safe&quot;.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
However, this idea of the Swiss bank was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, in the end, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with both large banks.
UBS has probably grown too big, he finds out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about it.
&quot;And if they did, they adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways long ago.&quot;
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, bringing it first high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the Subprime jungle as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
&quot;On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country of seven million decided on the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot;.
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save a large bank facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a massive concern.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it continued to grow.
It helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and a poorer but more internationally involved one.
Suddenly the internationalized investment bankers had a lot of money with which to spin the big roulette wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of the UBS concern, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
&quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the gut-guy guy who worked his way up from banking science.&quot;
But Ospel is said to have relied on Wuffli towards the end.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: &quot;I guess he thought his models were reality,&quot; says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of executives, in which the head of the group Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: Knock Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured &quot;League Tables&quot;, a waiting list documenting the success of the banks of the time.
In it, UBS strove for a position at the very top.
She has already managed a few steps.
She was at the very top of the game in foreign exchange and stock trading.
However, the business advisers who were commissioned emphasize one weakness: In the international interest business, in the bankers&#39; parlance, &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, there is probably a big gap behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has loopholes in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in US Subprime investments.
It developed into a massive machine that repackaged the securities into American mortgage loans and passed them on - while also retaining the risks itself.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out a long time ago.
&quot;Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,&quot; says banking expert Geiger.
As great is the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated.
Positions at UBS became an ejection seat and are rocking to this day.
Whoever runs a big bank now has an almost impossible job.
They have to find a strategy for a bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is to decline sharply, that much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss-Italian was only seen as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: He is to lead UBS&#39;s business in the long term, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-1990s.
3500 places will be deleted.
But that won&#39;t be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But so far he only says publicly that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has discouraged American investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not have the intended impact.
The dampened production of industry on the Continent nipped in the bud the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis.
A general facilitation by a change of government in Rome and Athens could not be achieved
the euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass last week was still considered half full, not half empty - but now problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, the financial values stood on the sales tickets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.6 percent at 12,078.
During trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&amp;P-500-Index ended at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index lost 0.8 percent and exited trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a drop of 1.2 percent at 5,985 counters.
Industry in the 17 countries using the euro significantly reduced production and prepared for the end of the boom.
Enterprises produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the statistical office Eurostat.
This made investors in the US skeptical. &quot;We are not an island, but dependent,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe is unlikely to recover from recession that quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investing legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC interview that it may not yet be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boosted the stock price of the traditional concern, sending it against the trend during early trading, which was quoted almost one percent higher.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of $170 a piece, according to his own data, and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Shares of Bank of America fell 2.6 percent, significantly stronger than the market.
The house is cashing in almost all of its remaining stake in China Construction Bank, receiving $6.6 billion for it.
The institute primarily wants to fill its capital quota with the net profit from the trade and thus meet the stricter regulatory requirements.
Aircraft maker Boeing rose slightly, paring losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent as the concern collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates Airline ordered 50 long-haul 777s on Sunday, valuing the order at $18 billion.
Including the right of first refusal for another 20 machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
About 710 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
719 values rose slightly, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, 630 shares advanced, 1,913 declined and 82 were unchanged in a turnover of 1.38 billion.
Smart crows are proliferating in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered &quot;problem birds&quot;: But these highly intelligent animals can no longer be banished from cities, say experts.
Some people like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities, residents complain about the dirtiness and noise caused by the animals.
At the same time, there is still no means in sight against &quot;problem birds&quot;.
Field ravens probably cannot be expelled from the cities, experts declared at the first symposium on crows in Leer, East Frisia.
There, experts from the entire federal territory consulted about possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
At the same time, conservationists derived the problems of cities also from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemicals in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing development and the felling of typical nesting trees make life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are in Soest in Westphalia, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer, among others.
There, a controversial 2005 mass crow-killing project in a rural district generated negative headlines.
Critics have described the trapping of animals in bird traps and the killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
&quot;Normal banishment, scaremongering, does not bring anything&quot;, so much found urbanist and landscape designer Werner Klöver from Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;Animals are retreating, large colonies are splitting up and dividing into other places&quot;.
Scaring is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
&quot;We have to live with them, we can&#39;t get them away.&quot;
The problem of cities cannot be solved without the surrounding area, was the opinion of the mayor of Leer, Wolfgang Kellner.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive residential areas and attracting them to settle in other places is conceivable.
&quot;Information boards instead of chainsaws&quot;, on the other hand, was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens due to a completely different treatment of animals.
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Educational Crow Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where information boards provide lessons on the life of the highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have already been accepted by tourists.
Mrs. Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: &quot;This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say.&quot;
The animals&#39; intelligence and dexterity are legendary: Ravens don&#39;t just use a tool to reach a treat, they even make their tool as a tool.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four field ravens to see how far the birds&#39; intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the rocks had to cause the structure to collapse in order to reach the moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized what size and shape the rock had to be to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a moth larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them, all four animals fashioned a hook, using which, like a fishing rod, they fished the container from the pipe by the holder.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do it even with a jam.
Cristiano Ronaldo fires Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for the cup did not come true.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-off matches.
Led by two-time superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) to complete their fifth consecutive European Championship after a 0-0 first-leg draw.
A 1:0 (0:0) result was enough for the Czechs in the Play-off rematch with outsider Černá Hora, when the first match was already a foregone conclusion.
Even Croatia did not score a goal with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg professional Zvjezdan Misimovic converted a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made it two for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia already disappointed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a peaceful start.
Ronaldo took an early lead by curling a free kick into the net from around 30 metres.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range shooting skills and made it 2-0 with a shot from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who were inactive in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from English club Manchester City, who is at the top of the table, settled the ball with his head on the bottom edge of the crossbar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
In the end, the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding stood in the center.
After a tackle on Helder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark ruled for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36th).
On the other side, Stark took a questionable free kick after Fabio Coentrao&#39;s action, which Misimovic confidently converted.
But after the break, the European vice-champion from 2004 cleared everything up with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek put an end to the last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this, the European champion from 1976 leaves for the fifth European Championship in a row.
However, coach Michal Bilek&#39;s team with Bundesliga legend Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented a possible own goal by Tomáš Sivok (9th) at the last moment.
Montenegro had their best opportunities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic shot just past Čech&#39;s goal from a turn from the edge of the penalty area.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, who had already been knocked down, again the striker of FC Seoul (50.) reduced.
A goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the soccer miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go beyond 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to vacate his place on the third bench at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians can rejoice in their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairytale start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan only hit the post with a shot from a distance, the striker Kazim also could not hang the rebound in the goal.
After that terrible second, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not get a goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who relieved Dortmund&#39;s Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, there were also legionnaires from the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward put coach Giovanni Trapattoni&#39;s side, who had won 4-0 in the first leg of the tie, into the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the visitors.
Ireland set the tempo from the start but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Los Angeles Galaxy&#39;s Robbie Keane had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian defense prevented a possible leading goal.
But it was quite far in the 32nd minute.
After a failed save by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to make it 1-0.

A hungry dog apparently caused a fire in an apartment in Brandenburg/Havel.
The Labrador may have jumped on the stove to reach the food, police said Friday
At the same time, he probably moved the switch and turned on one of the hotplates.
The paper on the stove caught fire.
A fire broke out in an apartment on the fourth floor of a multi-family house on Thursday morning.
The dog died of smoke inhalation.
The 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the apartment during the fire, is being investigated for starting the fire through negligence.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Around two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will flow in by 2015, the Dax concern said on Tuesday.
&quot;We will build additional research and development facilities and hire relevant personnel,&quot; Acting Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is now to increase from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world&#39;s number one enterprise software company will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP&#39;s more than 176,000 customers worldwide are in the booming country.
Growth plans in China are also an important building block of Dax Group&#39;s strategy for 2015.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs earned approximately 12.5 billion euros.
The software maker, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is doing as well as it has ever done.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
&quot;Now we would like to expand our activities (...)&quot;, stated McDermott.
&quot;Our goal is to promote sustained growth in China, supported by extensive research.&quot;
Carnage on a personal level
Peter Englund&#39;s emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a dizzying list of characters.
One piece of advice to keep yourself safe at that moment: Carefully tear this page out and bookmark it.
You will get to know all the characters very well in Mr. Englund&#39;s novelistic narrative, and this list will serve as a navigation - like a kind of beacon - for you at times when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as an &quot;anti-historical work&quot;.
It contains several well-known names, important treaties and famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as &quot;a book about what it was like&quot;. It deals mainly with &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods&quot;.
&quot;Beauty and Sorrow&quot; combines the wartime experiences of 20 or so men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go insane, or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of destinies while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund&#39;s book differs from classic historical novels.
It modifies the notion that the First World War was all about horrific trench warfare on the Western Front.
&quot;Beauty and Sorrow&quot; skilfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book deal with bees&#39; nests falling on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids, or dealing with the presence of tsetse flies.
It&#39;s a very moving read almost from the start.
War consumes people&#39;s lives like some natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina reeking of gunpowder.
When cannon fire starts in the distance and you are a woman at home with your children, do you run or stay?
Who is actually approaching?
Almost no one understands what is going on, or even why the whole war was started.
&quot;The vacuum created by the lack of facts,&quot; observed Mr. Englund, &quot;has been filled with conjecture, conjecture, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and Sorrow&quot; follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are generally taken from biographies, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives can sound terrifying and engaging, but the inclusion of small moments and details makes them completely alive and believable.
Many of them deal with hardship and coping with it.
In the story of the German student, the author says: &quot;Substitutes, substitutes everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Coffee substitute, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons.&quot;
He goes further and describes meal replacements in Germany.
It mentions &quot;meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes with wooden soles&quot;.
It mentions that there were &quot;837 registered meat substitutes in sausage production and 511 registered coffee substitutes&quot;.
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner urges for savagery and brutality, and declares of war: &quot;Eventually you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the evening paper or a good book and pretend that this mask of yours it represents civilization and that behind that starched self there is no barbarian hidden inside.&quot;
Conversely, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
&quot;When one finally comes to terms with sacrificing oneself, one would at least expect to do so in front of an appreciative audience,&quot; he writes.
Instead, however, he feels like a &quot;convict who will be secretly hanged&quot;.
Other notes concern the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
&quot;The conflict increasingly became an economic competition and a competitive struggle,&quot; Mr. Englund writes, &quot;a war between factories.&quot;
He captured what he calls &quot;a new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderer in tailored suits who carries out his carnage without leaving his desk.&quot;
People behave completely unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid frontline service.
&quot;The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trafficking of gonococcal pus, which soldiers bought and rubbed on their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;The most desperate also rubbed it into their eyes, which often blinded them for life.&quot;
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund&#39;s prose is brisk without being ostentatious, which suits his human subject admirably.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way in which the war &quot;unleashed completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;.
People are beginning to question why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War usually worked with hints rather than complex narratives, for example &quot;The First World War and Modern Memories&quot; by Paul Fussell or novels like &quot;Quiet on the Western Front&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional approach.
His book has the most crushing ending, unmatched in popular science literature.
However, I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from the list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake, this time a precisely planned raid to the minute
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some wearing the helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at that time.
No one except a few high-ranking officers knew about the event. The others were first told it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly presided over the event, whose presence underscored just how many challenges the police department faced during the operation.
The incidents of recent weeks, when pepper sprays were used against protesters, for example, were not allowed to be repeated, which violated the rules of the department and, moreover, the wave of public sympathy spilled over to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and drills.
The leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
A massive emergency response exercise took place at Randalls Island in preparation for the Zuccotti Park event.
Officials have stepped up so-called riot control training -- counterterrorism measures involving the rapid deployment of large numbers of police officers -- with a focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said someone to whom the action was initially explained as just a &quot;practice.&quot;
&quot;I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and they were definitely not told they were going to Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
“Only the highest ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park.
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already learned once.
On October 14, city officials had planned to clean up the park, but then backtracked because once protesters heard about it, hundreds flocked to the park before the operation began.
Police from various units participated in Tuesday&#39;s event, including task forces from around the area - dozens of officers who are routinely used to reinforce high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly explained that there were a lot of people coming and going to the park during the day, so one o&#39;clock at night was the perfect time to launch the event.
&quot;It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people as possible in the park,&quot; he said.
Emergency response trucks with arc lamps and streetlights lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before the units left.
The lights and the recorded message blaring from the street lights scared many of the protesters.
When law enforcement in their blue windbreakers entered the park, many of the protesters packed up their belongings and left.
Police say they did not touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack up.
Additional teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park to enter if any arrests needed to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief spokesman for the police department, Paul J. Browne, claimed it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing its units in action, and that some of the officers were rude to them.
Mr Browne claimed that TV vans on Church Street running along the western boundary of the park could film without problems.
Police advanced in a westerly direction, weaving their way through a thick tangle of protesters&#39; personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes. Teams from the sanitation department set out behind them and immediately raked up everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting visual materials appeared on the Internet shortly after.
The most ardent group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some formed a roadblock and the police began methodically arresting them.
About ten people in the center of the camp chained themselves to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests had been made at the park as of 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly reported.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said around 142 people were detained at the park.
Most of the arrests were made for &quot;organizing riots and resisting arrest,&quot; he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department&#39;s chief of detectives, also personally participated in the operation.
Mr Kelly was present but &quot;was not involved in the management of the operation&quot;, Mr Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it should be called out.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south of the park.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people even further beyond that line.
There were about 28 people at the northern border.
The wildest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., one protester was seen south of Pine Street jumping on the hood of a police van and several others deflating the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The auxiliary workers union will sue the city over the firing
Unions representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. They argue that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
A court appeal is likely the last option left to District Council 37 unions in their bid to overturn the layoff decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, who were among the lowest paid employees in the city, lost their jobs. Their firing was described by union leaders as retaliation by the city for denying him access to a health care fund administered by work crews last spring that the city was using to plug a budget hole.
City officials flatly denied the allegation.
At a City Council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the council immediately countered by saying that the budget did not specifically mention the dismissal of auxiliary workers anywhere.
District Council 37 officials said they had already filled out the necessary paperwork and warned the Department of Education that they would sue. They will hold a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the suit will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiffs will be the eight fired workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as are most of the other aides who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city&#39;s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would not comment on individual allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union focused on the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city to bolster its claim of unfair treatment. They are of the opinion that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient financial resources for a long time.
They point out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island schools and only minimal layoffs in the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, 17 school aides lost their jobs in Brownsville&#39;s District 23 and Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx even 46 assistants were dismissed.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight teaching assistants lost their jobs, despite the fact that it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood full of mobile parents who can raise funds to make up the budget shortfall.&quot;
Public School 36&#39;s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates bonus funding for each enrolled poor student.
Among other things, the union says high school principals may have been confused by the way the document authorizing the firing of parent coordinators was written.
In the document, the word &quot;excess&quot; was used to describe the action, i.e. to eliminate the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school&#39;s payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
&quot;Sixty-six parent coordinators were terminated,&quot; the draft complaint states, &quot;and not merely moved to the database as available staff.&quot;
The mission is over, Congress is ready to pass an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it appears that Republicans and Democrats in Congress will agree on something regarding the uprising in Libya.
Before that could happen, however, the revolution had to succeed, the long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the involvement of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will rule on a statement sponsored by Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) along with Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) congratulating the Libyans on their successful uprising and to thank the American troops for their &quot;bravery&quot;.
&quot;With this statement, we want to recognize the courage of the people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said.
&quot;Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts.&quot;
The mentioned sentences may seem innocent, but no debate related to Libya has been easy until now.
During the summer, lawmakers from both parties constantly argued with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of statements to approve or, conversely, reject the United States&#39; military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House of Representatives due to the differing opinions of the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would have stopped the funding of American operations in Libya.
Thus, the American mission in Libya literally found itself in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but its members were apparently not irritated enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
In the end, other events overtook the hesitancy of the Congress.
Rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The Nato mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In a statement, the Commission on International Relations &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan people , for extraordinary bravery and professionalism.&quot;
The statement also &quot;reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
Will the new proposal get the full support of the Committee on International Relations, or will lawmakers again be divided in two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the top GOP representative on the commission.
Lugar&#39;s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority of nearly all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
The measure, championed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (Va.), would be the first constitutional amendment on a budget or other subject to be voted on by the full House or Senate.
For the time being, the other legislators have not yet managed to push their proposals through to the actual vote, despite considerable effort.
Goodlatte&#39;s proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that have been introduced in Congress and touch on a wide variety of topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal presented to both the House and the Senate - and others are just slight variations of others.
In the House alone, there are at least 15 versions of a balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to &quot;regulate federal spending.&quot;
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their &quot;authorship&quot;.
The budget control provision passed in August required both the House and Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding declaration supporting the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (NY) wants to increase the number of terms the president can serve.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage and an amendment banning the burning of the national flag remain standing proposals.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be overturned if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, they do not deviate significantly from the average compared to previous years.
They offered 77 amendments in the 111th Congress, compared to 66 in the 100th Congress.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 amendments every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than today&#39;s politicians.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually drafted by Congress in 1789.
&quot;Battered, but not defeated,&quot; Gifford says in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was wounded at point-blank range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, singing along to a tune from the Broadway show &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow.&quot; and she declared that she was worth more than returning to Congress to get well.
Giffords appeared on ABC News&#39; &quot;20/20&quot; with Diane Sawyer. It could be seen that she still had problems forming sentences and needed help when walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessitated by the bullet wound that pierced the front of her skull, entered the left half of her brain and exited the back of her head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House for a triumphant vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting that killed six people and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;.
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, the 41-year-old Giffords replied, &quot;Pretty good.&quot;
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special on &quot;20/20&quot; that aired on the eve of the release of the couple&#39;s new book, &quot;Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.&quot;
The special followed Gifford&#39;s entire recovery from the Jan. 8 shooting.
Videos taken by Kelly during the first week show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can&#39;t do more than lift a finger or two at the time.
Months later, Giffords is pictured sitting in a wheelchair being taught by therapists how to perform simple activities.
Head nodding.
Lips pouting.
And then, her first word: &quot;What.&quot;
Within days, Giffords uttered another word -- &quot;toast&quot; -- as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a key role in Giffords&#39; recovery: In them, the congresswoman sings along with a therapist to the tunes of Cyndi Lauper&#39;s &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Free Fallin&#39;.&quot;
During the interview, Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, revealed to Sawyer that she has no recollection of the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he didn&#39;t read newspaper articles about the shooting to Gifford until March 12, when she first asked him who the six was who was killed in the incident.
The suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missouri, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of forcibly administered drugs.
&quot;A lot of people died,&quot; Giffords told Sawyer.
“Awful, awful, awful.
He revealed to Kelly Sawyer that at one point during his recovery, his wife declared, &quot;I lost.&quot;
&quot;So I told her right away, &#39;Gabby, you didn&#39;t lose,&#39;&quot; Kelly described.
“You just got a load.
But you&#39;ll get through it, pull yourself together and come back stronger than ever.&quot;
Military units are met with more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for New York&#39;s homeless war veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines gathered around him.
The festively dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
&quot;Both the men and women serving in the military were seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring benefit.
The then chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee also took part in the gala evening. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was also present, but he saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
&quot;They were all introduced as some kind of orphan,&quot; the officer wrote in an email.
I&#39;m sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes celebratory American public.
The army is endlessly covered in praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise comes at a cost, the soldiers say.
The public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for the individual in uniform.
&quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
“But it seems the only way some can support us is to cast us as unfortunate souls.
The subject is a very sensitive one for army commanders who do not want to appear ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath faced by troops returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano were returning from combat duty as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service would be viewed in two ways by people outside the military.
From the perspective of some, they will feel respect and awe as they have defeated enemy insurgents and visited exotic locations.
But others will wonder if &quot;underneath the surface is an evil, violent veteran,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to Washington to take a government post.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of his interviewers hinted at whether he could handle the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from combat.
&quot;When you talk about your service, you must expect negative reactions,&quot; Cancian instructed his sons.
The military&#39;s disquiet stems in part from America&#39;s indifference to wars.
Successes on the battlefield are rarely recognized in a country that has little awareness of its own military and sees little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;As a nation, we no longer value military heroism the way it did during World War II,&quot; said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public is mainly focused on the suffering of the men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing growing pressure to crack down on rape
A decision will be made this week on whether to go ahead with the trial of 28 women and men against the military over alleged inaction in a rape case.
If not, hundreds of other claimants are ready to file suit.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she was allegedly raped by a fellow soldier.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego. After having dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a case of 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her, that they could have a few drinks in her room.
&quot;A warning light went on in my head,&quot; Lyman described.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought: No, he&#39;s 19.
&quot;He&#39;s from Texas,&quot; she said.
“I wish I&#39;d listened to my instincts.
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, the man walked up to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will be about whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the proliferation of rape in the military, which violates the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington attorney Susan Burke, and the plaintiffs had 17 members at the time. Over the following months, however, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed to investigate, punish and seek any justice after the attacks were reported.
Burke says she is going after the top military commanders because the problem starts with them.
&quot;The military is a directive system,&quot; he says.
&quot;Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to put measures in place against such acts? The High Command.&quot;
Burke also says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than bundling all the allegations into this case -- putting all her eggs in one basket, as she says -- she&#39;ll file lawsuits in multiple different cases if necessary to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense is led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride, who along with his associates filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense&#39;s strategy -- basically, it&#39;s that current or former soldiers can&#39;t sue the military for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court ruling known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty soldiers.
&quot;The alleged injuries relate to the plaintiffs&#39; military service,&quot; the document states.
The Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, this is just a play on words: clearly defined front lines are hard to come by in modern wars.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
The time has come to modernize the military as well, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her struggle. In addition to her, three other legal representatives are dealing with the case.
At Yale Law School, attendees of a veterans&#39; seminar on legal services are preparing to sue four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic climate.
Separately, the nonprofit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military. The lawsuit focuses on the &quot;personality disorder&quot; diagnosis allegedly given to rape victims in order to give the military an excuse to discharge them - which activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group Service Women&#39;s Action Network, say is completely common practice.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the state&#39;s Veterans Affairs Organization, which it accuses of discriminatory practices in processing aid requests from people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and deputies from both political parties, proposing a whole range of corrective measures.
According to the Defense Department&#39;s Sexual Violence Prevention and Resolution Office, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack goes largely unreported, and according to the Pentagon&#39;s own estimates, the number corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, issued in March, also breaks down the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported to the military went to court -- half of the civilian justice system.
Prosecutors in Deputy Burke&#39;s case describe the attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
Private First Class Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it was supposed to have occurred.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine rape, and her attacker&#39;s blood was found in her bed - from a wound she made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman had a court hearing in which she was asked questions about whether she was making love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as hearsay witnesses in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day the verdict was handed down,&quot; says Lyman.
&quot;I felt like I was going to give birth right there - I ran out of the courtroom screaming.&quot;
&quot;They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, &#39;That wasn&#39;t his trial. It was mine.&#39;
The Lymans ordered her to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and therefore without the right to seniority.
Whether Lyman and the other plaintiffs&#39; case moves to the next stage or not, it&#39;s a long shot, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, &quot;From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of negotiations.&quot;
However, standing between them and the verdict is the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is several decades behind because their duties do not dictate maintaining the same level of incentives and deterrents.
He adds: &quot;The odds are heavily stacked against them... but it&#39;s important for them to try.&quot;
Change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn&#39;t go in their favor, Burkeva, the plaintiffs&#39; attorney, will round up hundreds of other people ready to file suit and begin working on other cases on the subject.
&quot;We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, from where there will be no reform,&quot; he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Examining You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who pleaded guilty to the July killing spree that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on the computer while preparing the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After this summer&#39;s tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
&quot;We realized that it&#39;s actually not that hard to get them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently released report by a British research team on European digital populism.
Facebook&#39;s store of personal information is so vast, Bartlett says, that researchers simply had to use ads on the site to pinpoint the demographic they were looking for — something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and targeted them with advertisements. However, instead of inviting them to a newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire asking questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever leaving the office.
&quot;It&#39;s a whole new way of doing research,&quot; notes Bartlett.
Some of the results aren&#39;t all that surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are overwhelmingly young men, irritated by rising immigration rates.
But on the other hand, &quot;those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.&quot;
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and policy researchers use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends hidden behind status updates, wall posts, and &quot;like&quot; buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides an average of three different data per day, which makes this social network literally an &quot;information supernova&quot; that is behind the development of many new researches. The number of academic theses with the word Facebook in their title has increased by almost 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the ability to study people without having to harass them on the street.
&quot;It used to be that if you wanted to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;You would have to get to a side where they would never let you in,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook is breaking all of this down — you just go straight to them.&quot;
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid social-health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that college students who discussed their drunken outings on Facebook were much more at risk of developing alcoholism than students who kept quiet about the topic.
Moreno suggests that students&#39; peers monitor the page and offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
&quot;You can&#39;t solve a problem if you can&#39;t diagnose it,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, Dr. Moreno&#39;s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children&#39;s Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
&quot;We found a way to identify at-risk children that we would otherwise have no chance of discovering.&quot;
Facebook itself is constantly probing the data of its users.
The site&#39;s information team has compiled statistics regarding the connection between relationship statuses and St. John&#39;s Day. Valentine&#39;s Day, 2010 voter turnout, and the nation&#39;s satisfaction quotient (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its trove of information available for research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is tracking them whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you have to give the site your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don&#39;t even know about?
Researchers have clearly defined rules about how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
&quot;I don&#39;t think most users had any idea that researchers could look at their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study he conducted using his students&#39; public Facebook walls.
&quot;As far as they were concerned, they took it as if the information was just between them and their friends.&quot;
Subsequently, there is also the issue of methodology to consider.
Even with offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way on Facebook to verify how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; explains Selwyn.
This is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, believes that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tools to use in research.
&quot;When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, that&#39;s something that can&#39;t be replaced,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities still happen offline.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who pleaded guilty to masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighter during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar,&quot; he declared outside the court, where 500 people had gathered.
&quot;I object to the court because you were mandated by organizations that support an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I confess to my actions, but I accept no guilt for them.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he &quot;did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which he could preach his views.&quot;
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for a further 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 weeks and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up tight.
All attended with the goal of bringing the case to an early conclusion.
&quot;I thought he looked cold and inhuman,&quot; one survivor of the attack told an NRK commentator.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved a little further.&quot;
Breivik, wearing a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When entering and leaving the building without difficulty, looking the present journalists and survivors in the eye.
Despite Breivik&#39;s bizarre notion that he was part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
It may be comforting to some that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically lessen the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
&quot;I wish she came off as a monster, but she&#39;s not,&quot; said a relative of one of the victims.
“If it did, everything would be a lot easier.
7 lessons from the lost interview with Steve Jobs in the movie heading to theaters this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, opinions began to emerge from people comparing him to Henry Ford - and voting him the Greatest Modern Inventor for his genius.
In a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that was dusted off for a special film heading to theaters this week, it will be clear to all Apple fans that his creative mind had an absolutely perfect understanding of the business processes and workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a meticulous organizer and a person who adjusts every little thing to the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from &quot;the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [ but] between a great idea and a great final product there is still a long way of a mouthful of work.&quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of the Computer Nerds, which discussed the dawn of personal computing. A unique, more than an hour long interview took place during the filming.
By then, it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, eagerly awaiting the general public&#39;s adoption of the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely&#39;s entire interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transit.
However, shortly after Jobs&#39; death, VHS copies were found in the director&#39;s garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to select theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has a reputation for reluctance to give lengthy interviews, here Jobs seems surprisingly excited to talk about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
And he also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there is a long pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thought, when you can see how Jobs thoroughly thinks the answer to be as concise and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs&#39;s perfectionism surfaces, when he seems impatient with Cringely&#39;s questions and pushes him to get to more important issues and topics more quickly.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, the interview is eerily prescient as Jobs assesses what other companies are doing right and wrong while offering his own vision of the future of computing.
It&#39;s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs&#39; career, but there&#39;s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here as an eager dreamer in the prime of his genius.
He has his own vision of how things could and should look like.
It wasn&#39;t long before, after expressing his ideas, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from The Lost Interview that are definitely worth watching:
How he learned to run a business:
&quot;Throughout my years in business, I&#39;ve always asked, &#39;Why do you do this?&#39; and the answer has always been the same: Well, that&#39;s just how it&#39;s done.&quot;
No one knows why they do what they do, they never think deeply about business matters.
That&#39;s what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was totally confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often started with the words &quot;standard costs&quot;, he could only guess at the amount. At that moment, he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that ensured that they could determine business costs in a matter of seconds.
How he grilled the Pope:
Jobs recalls the &quot;Blue Box&quot; he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
Much has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs&#39; enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He recounts how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone, switching from one AT&amp;T network to another during a call while using as many satellites as possible.
&quot;At least half a dozen times we&#39;ve gone round and round the world like that, so when we yell something into a pay phone, it&#39;s answered a minute later from the other phone by the door,&quot; laughs Jobs.
&quot;We were young and we found out that we could build a thing ourselves that was capable of running billions of dollars worth of infrastructure around the world.&quot;
The two of us made a tiny little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been created without it.
Jobs continues by describing a prank he and Wozniak almost pulled off. Through the Blue Box, they called the Vatican in the middle of the night and asked if they could speak to the Pope, impersonating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Gradually, more and more senior members of the Catholic Church were called in to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was only just before the Pope himself was woken up by the phone that the pair laughed and hung up.
How he fell in love with technology (and on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for parts to build an oscilloscope, he found Bill Hewlett&#39;s number in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;She had an incredible influence on me. She was the only company I knew at the time, and she shaped my view of what a company really is and how it should treat its employees.&quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company&#39;s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;
It was the size of a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I instantly fell in love with it.
As a teenager I worked my way up through HP, hanging around that computer and started writing programs for it.
How they innovate:
At several points during the interview, Jobs talks about how he invents new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he set out to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together an entire computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which he had to devise, assemble and deliver the finished device.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing the computer mouse:
&quot;I remember we had a pretty wild argument... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a $300 mouse] until I got bored and went out and found a designer.&quot;
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies run out of breath:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs presciently predicted that many industry leaders would falter in their vision and lose market share.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what?&quot;
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can&#39;t be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing already rule, so companies are headed by people who are in charge of just that, while people in charge of their own products are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That&#39;s exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times the size it is, it could have been the Microsoft of the nineties...
However, instead of winning, they earned a loss.
How he takes innovation as an art form:
&quot;There&#39;s still a long way and a lot of work between a great idea and a great finished product... and as that great idea evolves, it changes and grows.&quot;
You will learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to make a number of compromises - you just can&#39;t make electrons, glass, robots or factories do certain things.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end it comes down to taste - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in some way you try to reflect them in what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I&#39;ve never been shy about robbing the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so wonderful and successful because the people who worked there were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren&#39;t for computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the health care law while their case was before the court
On a day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to consider the politically controversial question of whether to take up a challenge to President Obama&#39;s health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will participate in proceedings before the court.
The event took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the motions filed.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the radical health care overhaul passed by Congress last year - a law that has mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the suit. However, a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, the outcome of which will further stir up the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will appear in court and try to get the bill thrown out will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement&#39;s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a longtime conservative legal advocacy group.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the aforementioned case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican representative in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the health care law.
And featuring guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It&#39;s nothing new: The pair of judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is certainly not about anything that would be in conflict with the rules of ethics.
In effect, these judges are exempt from the code of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behavior would definitely fall under principle C4, which states that &quot;a judge may participate in events organized by related and other organizations for the purpose of raising funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or be featured on the program of the event.&quot;
Still, Scalia and Thomas&#39; relationship with the two law firms involved in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest in the case, was enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in government.
&quot;This shocking breach of ethics and disregard for the code of conduct flies in the face of several justices&#39; claims that the Supreme Court is held to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
&quot;Judges wined and dined at a social benefit with attorneys awaiting their case before the court.&quot;
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this event undermines any claim of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics, telling them that they too have no problem combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas&#39; wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives object that the ethical problem mainly lies with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was serving as attorney general under President Obama when the first challenges to the law came before the court.
Kagan&#39;s critics are pressing her to recuse herself from the case, saying she fought too hard for the law then to be dispassionate now.
Kagan has given no indication that she is going to step down.
Boeing has won a record $18 billion jet order
Emirates Airlines orders 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets with an option to buy 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it will collect more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of its products, it&#39;s usually nothing to celebrate.
However, if that company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 planes totaling a record 18 billion USD is something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
The Chicago-based company estimates airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years, according to a forecast released Monday.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its largest-ever order in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The sensational order came from Dubai-based Emirates Airlines.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline has an option to buy an additional 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to $26 billion.
Then on Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes called Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger amenities.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds 1 billion USD.
&quot;This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company,&quot; said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
&quot;The quality of these particular customers is very high.&quot;
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil producing nations there.
This means that not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in the price of fuel - which usually hurts airlines because it is one of their biggest costs - is not as decisive because the country itself is making money from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora says.
&quot;They have that natural protection,&quot; he says.
The Emirates order cements Boeing&#39;s leadership in the wide-body market and puts Airbus SAS on edge, which has been keen to try to disrupt Boeing&#39;s dominance with its A350 transporter.
Boeing&#39;s victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of its largest aircraft, the A350, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be postponed.
The pushback occurred because customers demanded more aircraft payload and range, so the manufacturer took time to give the machine more engine power.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president was apparently defeated in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was helped by drug traffickers in his pursuit of the governorship.
Felipe Calderona&#39;s sister appears to have lost a violent state election for governor in Michoacán. On Monday, she subsequently declared that one of her opponents had been helped by drug traffickers to win.
Preliminary results gave Faust Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the lead in the western state&#39;s gubernatorial election.
&quot;The intervention of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in yesterday&#39;s election itself is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country,&quot; said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday&#39;s elections.
“They threatened our candidates, members of the polling team... They confiscated ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and let people vote to order for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
But he plans to return to power soon, and winning the Michoacán elections is an important step in that effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly defeated Calderon, who was leading a day before the election.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother&#39;s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has until now controlled the governor&#39;s office, came in third. It is a very unfortunate defeat for a divided and ill-fated party ahead of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital Morelia, denies any ties to drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against traffickers.
However, the violence continued.
A PAN mayor, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However, whatever the results of the Michoacán elections look like for the PRI, a victory will help the party gain new momentum.
The PRI&#39;s expected presidential candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto, of Washington, congratulated Vallejo, saying, &quot;I think this victory could be very encouraging for the coming year.&quot;
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB bank, said the world&#39;s two fastest-growing economies must &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements .
He warned that the Bric nations [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching Europe&#39;s troubles &quot;too dispassionately&quot; and said that Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and resources, would help avert a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We&#39;re all in this together.
&quot;So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is a good fit,&quot; he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is certainly not immune.
&quot;So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it.&quot;
The European Monetary Union has been severely tested for several months by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy&#39;s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe&#39;s growing debt crisis has raised fears it could plunge the global economy back into recession, and calls have emerged for the booming frontline economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channeled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as buying bonds from the European Union&#39;s Financial Assistance Fund, the institution for European financial stability - would give European countries&#39; Asian partners greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India&#39;s commerce minister, said that &quot;India will do what it can&quot; to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and drying up of foreign capital inflows.
&quot;Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless,&quot; he said.
&quot;We have a tough task ahead of us and we have to maintain a high growth rate.&quot;
&quot;This is not an alternative, this is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot;
Others argue that developing economies such as India&#39;s have no business helping European economies when they are forced to face serious economic problems of their own.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain European aid to India&#39;s 1.2 billion people, when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
&quot;One day they might find out that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their vacations on beaches, which would probably be hard to explain to them,&quot; he noted.
Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian reserves should be used to keep many Greek citizens in good-paying jobs in mismanaged and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag emphasized that the Eurozone crisis threatens a &quot;dangerous domino effect&quot;.
The bank&#39;s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a &quot;downside risk&quot; due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must create &quot;contingency spending plans&quot; to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warning about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave Congress a hard time Monday when he warned that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and set off a financial chain reaction that starts at the Pentagon and continues across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next decade, but now fears another $600 billion in cuts if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
He said the inability of Congress to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called impasse will cause a 23% flat rate drop and halt many new projects.
&quot;Such a huge cut, used in this reckless manner, will make it impossible to do most of our building or shipping projects -- you can&#39;t just buy three-quarters of the buildings or ships. And it could seriously damage other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote to senators.
&quot;We will also be forced to furlough many of our civilian employees, and since the cuts are going to happen so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to put civilians on furlough in order to be able to meet the target requirements.&quot;
&quot;These changes could shake the faith of those who care about our military and seriously damage its readiness.&quot;
Eventually, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta announced.
&quot;Although accounts for financing possible military operations overseas will not be directly affected by this shutdown, operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets,&quot; Panetta warned.
&quot;There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in delays in negotiated contracts supporting the war effort of our people.&quot;
&quot;The number of paid employees will be reduced, which will result in delayed payments to suppliers and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support.&quot;
Both senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago asking him for details regarding the possible impact on automatic cuts at the Defense Department.
&quot;The consequences of the shutdown at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power.&quot;
&quot;We are strictly opposed to this tough measure,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta&#39;s letter.
&quot;It&#39;s not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don&#39;t want to sign up to it.&quot;
&quot;The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow.&quot;
&quot;It remains to be seen whether Panetta&#39;s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to pass the budget and strengthen voices calling for the Pentagon to be removed from the cut list.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken in recent talks about possible cuts, even though he himself came to his top Pentagon post with years of experience passing budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was in for an uphill battle.
At a press conference organized last week, the Minister of Defense gave a brief picture of what his department can expect - a shell of the army, inside which, however, the core will be missing.
“It will be like a ship without sailors.
“It will be like a brigade without ammunition.
&quot;It will be like an air force without trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks and buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission,&quot; Panetta said at the start of a speech at the Pentagon.
“It will be like a unit without morale, unprepared and unable to match a possible enemy.
&quot;As a result, he will welcome aggression...&quot;
In an addendum included with the letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the cuts will result in &quot;significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reductions in airborne and deployment capabilities worldwide; projected unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot;
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could face termination, including those that are already being tested and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a next-generation ballistic submarine, a new littoral combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps wanted to replace the Humvee with.
Halting further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next 10 years, but supporters say it is a necessary next step in upgrading the military, which is needed for the country to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals .
How to spot a lie
A cursory glance at recent newspaper headlines suggests just how serious and pervasive lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full amid allegations that he sexually harassed multiple women -- both sides say the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University have been accused of perjury when they tried to cover up records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling US President Barack Obama into a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie was able to destroy entire careers and undermine the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing campaign funds to try to hide his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that erupted around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating at school and university abound.
There are cases where teachers themselves will give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite send the message that lying and cheating is acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that you lie anywhere between 10 and 200 times in a single day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Lie detection, or &quot;lie detection&quot;, is an essential skill that everyone should learn, whether for personal or professional reasons.
However, it is not a party game similar to, say, Charades where one shouts &quot;I got you&quot;. Deception detection is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you straight in the eye.
It&#39;s not like they stammer, stutter, blush, or fidge.
However, do not assume that it is somehow difficult to spot and detect liars.
A trained lie detector can detect the truth from sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are phrased and their timing.
I&#39;ve spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from the vast and growing field of lie detection, and it&#39;s clear that deception detection is a modern skill that&#39;s easy to learn and can be of great help in today&#39;s complex world - especially if your job duties include include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing people.
Good liars are also good at reading others, letting them down, channeling their emotions and intuitively realizing how the other side is receiving them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more &quot;self-centered&quot; lies, while women tell more &quot;other-centered&quot; lies - mostly to protect someone&#39;s feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (however, the lies they tell are usually &quot;outrageous&quot;).
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the subject&#39;s normal behavior.
This is called an &quot;initial observation&quot;.
Thanks to it, later findings will have something to compare with.
Notice the subject&#39;s posture, his laughter, voice work.
You should know if someone habitually taps their feet all the time so that you don&#39;t falsely accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of fake verbal and non-verbal behavior.
However, take these only as warning signs, not as proof of a lie.
People who tell lies may stop moving their upper body as they try to recall their fabricated story, turn their toes toward the door, lean toward the exit, change their posture significantly, or show &quot;relief when the conversation is over&quot;—exaggerated sighs of relief and change positions when a difficult confession is behind them.
Interviewers will often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like when it is over.
Also note the subject&#39;s language.
There is a famous story about how Scott Peterson once misspoken and used the past tense when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, sparking a nationwide manhunt for her body.
Lying individuals may also say measuredly: &quot;I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinska&quot; or repeat the difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal signs are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of &quot;mitigating language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge.&quot;
We don&#39;t learn too many facts in such an answer and it is often another warning signal.
There is no magic that can detect every lie, but it is possible to learn the skills to spot a lie.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a better chance of not encountering a liar and a fraud in his personal and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan to be redirected after US government approval threatened to be delayed
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - antagonizing unions but reassuring environmentalists - the company building the pipeline said it was willing to redirect the project so that things are moving again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it will move the pipeline&#39;s planned route out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills region of Nebraska, and is confident the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada columnist Alex Pourbax says the company is confident the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will take a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was delaying a decision on a federal permit for the project, pending studies of possible alternate routes that would avoid impacting Nebraska&#39;s Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground reservoir of water.
&quot;This is really a step forward,&quot; Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department would likely delay any decision until 2013, a year after next year&#39;s election, but authorities deny that politics played any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a State Department request and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
700,000 barrels of oil flow daily from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This route will have to cross 6 states.
The project is absolutely loathed by environmentalists, but loved by work crews who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created by the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers have opposed the plan and are considering laws that would force the company to stay out of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing State Department-commissioned environmental impact study found the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the department&#39;s inspector general has ordered a new review of the entire original study process, focusing mainly on two questions.
One was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, presented a conflict of interest in the program.
Another is whether the firm that was hired to do the original study was improperly chosen because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of causing a toddler to throw up with fear
A New York family says singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter into vomiting.
The &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; singer&#39;s outing scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disturbances&quot; and &quot;increased fear of strangers,&quot; her family claims in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk pulled up the car, Roseanna Monk came down with her luggage into the foyer of their Riverside Boulevard home, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped for a moment at the door and put the baby down for a moment.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and said, &#39;Do you know what your daughter is doing?&#39; I said &#39;yes&#39; and went to pick her up.&quot;
LaBelle angrily scolded the pregnant woman.
&quot;She said to me in an aggressive tone, &#39;You shouldn&#39;t put your daughter at the door,&#39;&quot; Roseanna Monk said.
&quot;I told her, &#39;I don&#39;t care about your opinion.&#39;&quot;
She became enraged and began to speak obscenities - loudly shouting the most obscene expressions...
She had a water bottle with her and started splashing water on me.
She claims that Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
&quot;I said to the woman, &#39;Look what you did to my daughter,&#39;&quot; the child&#39;s mother said.
LaBelle lunged at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to be stopped by her escort, who then dragged her to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
Meanwhile, the daughter screamed so much that she threw up, she added.
The family later sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle&#39;s attorney and spokesperson did not return calls for comment on the case.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family&#39;s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took on the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money awarded to a children&#39;s cancer charity.
&quot;The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed at a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms.&quot;
The adverse climate slowed down the economy
During the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and with it the economy
The year 2011 will go down in Sinaloa&#39;s economic history. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to unfavorable climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February caused millions of dollars in losses in agriculture, limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, and are responsible for the reduction of economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historic decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% was partially damaged. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, maize and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state has seen an increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose to 5.28%, and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise to 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed increased by 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
Several factors are responsible for unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa. According to Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the level of public policy.
&quot;We are witnessing rising unemployment that is related to various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of the anti-money laundering legislation passed by Congress. For people who illegally get their hands on dollars, it is not easy for them to earn it, invest it or use it for something,&quot; he emphasized.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
&quot;The number of people going to work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficulty of entry and also because even when these people get across the border, it is difficult for them to find work. So people stay and they demand work from our state, so unemployment is growing&quot;, he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa also worsens due to the increasing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state work without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Unemployment and unreliability are compounded by other features of the labor market, such as low wages. This administrative territory has the lowest salaries in the whole country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa state was 5,352 pesetas as of September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening foreign direct investment
Together with the decrease in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, 2011 also saw the most significant decrease in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, foreign direct investment reached the amount of 630,697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74% compared to the amount of 5,143,312 dollars for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government reports investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly aimed at companies in the service sector.
Debt
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with the aim of revitalizing the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. By November, there were no gains on debt, in any sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés highlighted the lack of management skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
&quot;The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really slight during this year. We have to work intensively to regain the ground we lost this year. In 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, there was a lack of harmonization of the efforts of all of us and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better,&quot; he said.
Slow economy
Loredo López said that events such as frost at the beginning of the year halted the state&#39;s economy and limited its development and growth.
&quot;The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to re-establish the dynamism that would allow to reach an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That is why we are at at the end of the year they found themselves well below the expected forecasts&quot;, he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
&quot;Generally speaking, we observe that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared, in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has&quot;. he said.
The work ahead
The Coparmex chairman emphasized the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the government&#39;s efforts.
&quot;In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there has been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan&quot;, he said.
He said the current administration has shown progress in conducting public policy.
&quot;There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that the work done here is visible, and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead,&quot; he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican Army units on June 7, 2010, while on an errand in Cipriano Valdez Street, across from Station 80 in the neighborhood of El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving a white pick-up van. He had a black bag in the car shelf and a small backpack on the passenger seat. Troopers found 8 kilograms (23 grams) of marijuana.
For these reasons, the arrested man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Department and the proceedings remain internal within the Center for the Implementation of the Legal Effects of Criminal Offenses.
He owes contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants face the risk of not being completed or of being greatly delayed due to a lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of the city&#39;s social development said that while the construction work has gone ahead until now, the state government is now in danger of not being able to secure the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in the three programs is nearly 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have provided funds for the work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
&quot;They are supposed to provide almost 12 million and although the year is already coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. And this despite the fact that we were supposed to receive a part already in July&quot;, he said. &quot;In order not to waste time, we have started the projects and they are going very well, but we lack money&quot;.
He said that last year under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padillo, the state did not fulfill the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new term, the city had to ask for a loan to be able to pay the more than 7 million that the state administration did not give them.
&quot;The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to raise funds to cover what was not completed state&quot;, he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise from state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armando Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance, to speed up the procedure and the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
&quot;They were supposed to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we still haven&#39;t received a peso&quot;.
Court approves &quot;end of analog broadcasting&quot; in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuit presented by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to speed up the so-called &quot;switching off of analog signals&quot; and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. It stated that the necessary eight votes that would invalidate it were not found.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree outlining the steps that will lead to the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed, because the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). Thus, there is a violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he does not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures through general standards to prepare the public administration.
&quot;I don&#39;t think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body&quot;, recalling that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital ones is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would mean delaying the benefits of digitization, which requires a decision in the public interest. Digitization does not only have a technical dimension, but &quot;also affects economic, social, political and national security issues&quot;.
As he emphasized, these issues &quot;require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the hands of the state government&quot;.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to a digital system and had done so through their governments, despite having highly specialized technical authorities at their disposal.
He stated that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree which encroached to some extent upon the powers of Congress, to bring into the domain of administration the observance of the laws prepared by the legislature.
In Michoacán, they are analyzing the possibility of a vote-by-vote census
According to data released by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is less than 27 percent. The votes of 879 of the 6,074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
The vote-by-vote counting option appeared in this year&#39;s elections in Michoacán, where, according to data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is less than 27 percent, and that&#39;s not counting the votes of 879 of a total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of measures that should harmonize local norms with the federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially ratified its political constitution or its State Electoral Code or Law on Electoral Justice. Indeed, the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force this election period was to expire, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected to publish them within the deadline set in the Official State Gazette Law, saying that he had some objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state&#39;s vote on constitutional reforms &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; because he has no right to &quot;neither approve nor veto&quot; them.
When asked about the possibility of a vote-by-vote count, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it would be possible for the local electoral body to carry out partial and total counts.
In this way, a partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or it is not available to the chairman in question; or if there were errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever there is an express request at the beginning of the session by a representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place.
A total recount of votes will also be possible if, after a proper count, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the runner-up is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an express request of the political party whose candidate finished in second place. In such a case, electoral parcels for which a partial count was carried out will be discarded.
It should be mentioned that the election in Morelia is in such a situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is less than 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. A solemn ceremony and funeral mass will take place on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel&#39;s last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinámé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the others who died in the crash, Bacio Cortés&#39; family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel&#39;s ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza Avenue, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 in the afternoon, a farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former classmates from the high school of technology and members of the American football team, which Felipe Bacio was also a member of during his graduation.
&quot;He wanted to return to Saltillo and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains. That&#39;s what he always told his family and friends,&quot; said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot&#39;s sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the peak of his life, &quot;he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, son, loving brother who lived for his family&quot;.
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age and entered the Colegio del Aire aviation school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn&#39;t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, however he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, &quot;as soon as he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo&quot;.
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old he went to Zapopan for his uncle&#39;s graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
They bid him a final farewell
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to pay him Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, leaders and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter he was piloting crashed. Also on board was the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of that state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Saltillen native Bacio Cortés (cremated) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force under the command of Major Jaime Martinez through a funeral service at the plaza, where meanwhile the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives had gathered , students and teachers.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in the area for offenses related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by gunshots to different parts of the body and head were found in an abandoned farmhouse in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery occurred 1.5 kilometers from the road from Cadereyto to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved around these places noticed that the cottage with the beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the dead bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the persons was wearing a yellow sports T-shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him lay a person also in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying face down.
According to the data obtained at the locations, all three persons were probably murdered at another location, as no bullets were found.
Messages addressed from one organized crime group to another were found on the fence of the cottage, as well as numerous bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
They detained 11 suspects in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyt area and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to published information, in the first attempt on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony, 8 people were detained and one detainee was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were seized. They confirmed that they are members of a criminal group called &quot;Los Zetas&quot;.
The next raid took place on November 12 at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they noticed a car with no license plate and two people inside.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a cartridge case and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices was arrested in the area of La Frauda on November 13 around 2 p.m. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to run away.
They were accused of illegal burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government to tackle the crisis that is keeping the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet Italy&#39;s president tomorrow to present him with a new government to tackle the crisis that is keeping the country on the brink of economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The presidential palace issued a statement announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
He is expected to introduce a government made up mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
&quot;I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country&#39;s ability to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles had been overcome.
&quot;The framework is now well defined&quot;, he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy struggles to combat a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders. Only in this way will it be possible to restore Italy&#39;s shattered credibility.
There is a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry up. Because of market volatility, interest on Italy&#39;s 10-year BTP bonds exceeded 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for a bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers&#39; organization Confindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we will support this government very much&quot;.
We believe that this government is the last option to get Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti&#39;s hopes of success have been greatly boosted by the PDL&#39;s support for Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
&quot;We believe that Professor Monti&#39;s efforts are destined for good results,&quot; Angelina Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy&#39;s largest party, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed Monti&#39;s technocratic majority government.
Parliament support
Monti&#39;s new government must have strong parliamentary support to push through unpopular austerity reforms.
Any setback or delay in that effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti&#39;s failure could spell disaster.
On Monday, Monti opened negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women&#39;s organizations.
The round of negotiations will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who has enabled a very rapid response to the crisis.
After a brief decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond yields have returned to a critical level, reacting to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, whose public debt stands at 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the means of the eurozone&#39;s current financial reserves.
Monti has said his government should stay in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians will only give him time to implement reforms and then call early elections .
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be made up of experts only to lead Italy out of the trouble the country has been in due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to include political figures in the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the threshold of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players called up reached the 50-game mark.
A huge contrast in the Costa Rican side if we compare the 22 players of the two countries who meet today in a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA&#39;s monthly ratings, have a wide range of A-class internationals to their credit, Costa Rica only have defender Michael Uman, the only player to have played 50 international matches.
He reached this number last Friday during the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star Game and in the powerful clubs of the English First League maintain intense activity throughout the year in league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in European cups such as the Champions League.
To the previous one, we must also add the experience of the national Spanish team during the complicated elimination matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that goalkeeper Íker Casillas has the most number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team, who last Saturday before England (0-1 loss in London) caught up with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreto with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also start today against Costa Rica and will get a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player for Barcelona, has 106 games under his belt.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced by UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have reached 100 games. Among them the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke center forward Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol also came close to 100 with 97 matches.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fabregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and close to Michael Uman are left winger Júnior Díaz with 48 caps and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 have surpassed the 30 game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Fewest number of matches.
With less than 30 games in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) figure.
The national side with less than 30 caps are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not even exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain&#39;s top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in their tour to celebrate twenty years of existence
&quot;A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We&#39;ve been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band itself assures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for them.
So said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate twenty years of existence and will make a unique stop in Central America on Sunday the 20th.
On this day, he will perform from 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on La Nación&#39;s website.
It&#39;s a dream come true for your Costa Rican supporters. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is also our dream that is becoming a reality.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and the experience so far has been great.
I&#39;ve only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It is a beautiful country and I believe we will be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the group here, the fans experience these preparation days very intensely.
What do you say to your staunchest supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry it took us so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve put on in the last 21 years have been created in the space of a few weeks.
We played some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get ourselves in shape for the gig in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfable waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And that&#39;s how we found out about Costa Rica, through people who love to surf.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What do you have planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we&#39;ve never played here, there&#39;s no limit to what we can&#39;t do.
We will try to put on the best show possible with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think part of it is because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it&#39;s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven&#39;t played for a long time, we focus on them and are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have already forgotten about it.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s more interesting for people.
With this tour you are celebrating 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe all you accomplished?
Yes, that&#39;s for sure.
First of all, I don&#39;t think any of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realize how much has been given to us and are touched that we can continue to play together.
We like each other and we like making music.
We are lucky to be able to see the places we have always wanted to see.
We couldn&#39;t have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were a significant part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the greats themselves are represented.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It&#39;s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, it doesn&#39;t happen very often.
From time to time a group will form in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at once.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky to have all of them as our friends and honored to be a part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It&#39;s also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a lot longer than the usual duration of a band.
I think that firstly, we are all lucky to still be in this world and secondly, the fact that we are always interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to that we have managed to open musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we respect each other&#39;s music and I think it couldn&#39;t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame was not simple. However, thanks to your success, you can do whatever you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it gradually became easier to find the balance.
We try not to tour too much because it&#39;s very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for the music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You mustn&#39;t get carried away by being famous, rock stars. Neither of us ever really cared.
How do you remember Mother Love Bone&#39;s next project?
I think we wrote great songs and it was something spectacular at the beginning.
We were a band for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at photos, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you&#39;re familiar with their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that&#39;s why you chose them as frontmen?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas will offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That&#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&#39;t know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
The first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge going even though it&#39;s out of style?
I think we&#39;ve all always felt slightly detached from the word grunge.
When I say grunge, I think of the bands I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out at the same time. And if the music is still valid like that today, that&#39;s a great thing, because it&#39;s music worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
It&#39;s interesting because I feel like there are a few songs on the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very dark, even though they can sound positive.
Both of them made me cry when Ed played them, and they&#39;re deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and have some kind of trauma in your life, lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital where he will undergo tests due to muscle loss in his lower limbs, his attending physician said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four operations and is currently under control by doctors.
Rep. Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days to find out why he is in pain and losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, however, the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and added to these problems were other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a killing squad of troops operating illegally in the first years of his rule.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by the Uruguayan president, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch upon the political issues of the given region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with political, business and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information regarding political matters between the two countries,&quot; the Uruguayan presidential office posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to back Uruguay in a dispute with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that continue to be tax havens will be excluded from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world&#39;s most powerful developing and developed countries. Since January of this year, it has signed an agreement on the exchange of information with the aforementioned Latin American country to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been striving to concretize fiscal exchange agreements with the aim of getting off the &quot;black list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives in all stores worldwide this month, has been created from the ground up to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without the need for glasses.
&quot;Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,&quot; said Nintendo of Spain&#39;s specialist press, Omar Álvarez, during the video game&#39;s presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;Nintendo&#39;s first video game created specifically for this carrier&quot; because until now successful pictures like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; were adaptations of already existing titles .
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to being 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is an &quot;accessible&quot; video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you beat this level, you can start a &quot;second round&quot; of game levels that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and &quot;not succumb to optical illusions&quot;.
This new arrival of Super Mario in 3D also foresees the return of the character to a portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the tune of those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula of the previous installments. It consists in the fact that the plumber of the bearded man will have to pass through dangerous mined platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find new things in the movements, in the environment, in disguises and also among the enemies, the &quot;playful&quot; Luigi will also appear.
Colom approved the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has advanced the issue of the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for conspiracy to launder 70 million US dollars.
This ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the northern country&#39;s request for Portillo&#39;s extradition to stand trial.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, and that he was mindful that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he did not &quot;interfere&quot; in court decisions and allowed all extraditions that came to his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom&#39;s move marks an execution step after all judicial and constitutional avenues have been exhausted to prosecute the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling 120 million at the Ministry of Defense during his presidency. That process preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to help children without education so that they do not find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinijove social support organization is very important: 6,000 young people who were at risk of social exclusion received help. The organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday&#39;s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet in a celebratory event that took place in the former Fabra and Coats factory premises and was attended by more than 300 people.
The Trinijove organization was established in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, without work, struggling with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday&#39;s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Arturo Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the former socialist advisor for education, Ernest Maragall, and the former deputy mayor and current ecological-socialist councilor, Ricard Goma, took part in the ceremony.
The current advisor for Social Welfare and the Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also appeared in the great hall of Fabra and Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was created in a very difficult time and that today also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to date &quot;is a good foundation&quot;.
The President cited Trini as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
&quot;Crisis is nothing new for this organization and the work it does,&quot; he said.
There was an eviction of a foreclosed house in which gigantic parties were held
The intruders appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the house at noon yesterday without resistance
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors of number 51 Balmes Street is finally over.
Yesterday at noon, twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying and where they organized gigantic parties that woke up the neighbors. They left the building by order of the court and without the police having to intervene.
After the operation, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
&quot;From now on, the entrance will be guarded&quot;, declared the administrator.
The occupiers, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the given building - the rest are inhabited -, took away all the electrical and partly also the water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind all kinds of rubbish, especially cans of alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments hosted huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales dropped by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupants of the building were giving her unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while at the disco they cost 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment establishment had to respond to complaints from neighbors due to noise. However, the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially those who participated in the parties organized here, the frequency and intensity of which has increased in recent weeks, according to angry residents of the area.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that they even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and he has been forgiving her rent for nine months.
City police also confirmed that they had received multiple complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The head of the municipal group of the People&#39;s Party PP at City Hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded last week that &quot;the building be immediately evicted and thus put an end to the problems of civil coexistence suffered by the neighbors and to the destruction of the area&quot;.
The chairman of the People&#39;s Committee explained that only one floor had been occupied before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and one of them had even been robbed.
In this regard, he added that &quot;it is necessary to put an end to impunity and be consistent when it comes to acts against civil responsibility that occurred in the building&quot;.
Yesterday, the city police also cleared a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at 35 Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the procedure, which entails more than controversy regarding fees
The municipal tender for 16 gates opens the debate again about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, during the heyday of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What&#39;s more, it was accompanied by a numerical comparison with New York&#39;s Central Park.
After the CMB ceased to exist in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that is not oriented on the axis north - south, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of Yogi the bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate is more reminiscent of the idea of a park.
Either that or someone is trying to put a gate on the field.
So the only question arises: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and based on reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It&#39;s a theme as old as when two members of this old caste of the chosen shake hands when they meet in an elevator.
And it was this act that caused one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects think and the leading university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure has its merits.
According to Roldán, after the issue of the bay side started, &quot;it is necessary&quot; to discuss the &quot;mountain side&quot; as well, so Ildefonso Cerdo&#39;s speech about green apples was not finished.
&quot;We have to start from the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex&quot;, declared the architect, for whom the name &quot;gates to Collserola&quot; contains a &quot;lexicological trap&quot;: we must not imagine them &quot;as entrances to the park, but rather as defining zones where it is possible to act&quot;.
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers&quot;.
The danger arising from the &quot;uncertainty that the public place project represents today&quot; after the experience of the 1980s, which had &quot;its swan song&quot; in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
&quot;To define something means to take another step&quot;, that is, basically to move one step further.
&quot;The new urban planning and planning tools need to be kept in mind because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster&quot;.
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be &quot;considered a park&quot;, but the Barcelona part cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola, which &quot;must not end up in the landfill&quot;, although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his board to intervene in the project from &quot;the first moment&quot;.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to join the debate, but he &quot;doubts&quot; that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;it&#39;s all about skills&quot;, he adds) that need to be created: &quot;Architects should only be tools&quot;.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the title to this game is complicated, because the tender documents lack the global vision of Collserol: &quot;16 tenders have been announced, all dealing with the mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal study, which would look at the area and understand it as a whole&quot;.
This causes that at least he applied for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may conflict with the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the town hall should guarantee that the strip located immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the zone of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardoned Jonás Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days in prison, Cadino Red&#39;s legal representative pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after Casino Red&#39;s legal representative granted him amnesty before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which was hearing a case of extortion in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was accused.
After the Casino Royale assassination, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás was supposed to ask him to pay an economic quota in order for Monterrey City Hall to allow an illegal operation in the betting house.
After the public indictment, the State Prosecutor&#39;s Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panist mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then after spending 4 hours in front of the Public Ministry Agent number 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after a second detention order was issued and a Public Service agent ruled out complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was taken to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of extorting one and a half million pesos from the owners of Casino Red. However, he only stayed a few hours in a medium-security prison because he received death threats.
Officials allowed him to remain in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that after nearly two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to prove Jonás&#39;s guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino officials in exchange for a promise to allow the operation.
This Monday, Casina Red&#39;s legal representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for clemency for the brother of the regional mayor. Based on this, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damages had been repaired and which of the companions decided to grant the pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name will remain confidential.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal. There will be no appeal possible in the trial that was conducted against him. It is also not possible to request compensation for damages or punishment.
After a discussion with the legal representative around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Bretón.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been granted an official pardon and his case had been placed on file.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor&#39;s secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed Secretary of the Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter hit the terrain directly with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the plane took off, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions allowed the flight.
&quot;Parts emerging indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings became entangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost the fuselage&quot;.
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met all the requirements for transporting personnel.
Additionally, he stated that based on the investigation conducted in the impact area, no parts were found on the ground.
&quot;During the search, it was found that the parts of the plane were not located elsewhere, so the plane hit the ground as a whole.
&quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for transporting people.
The terrain has a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the most important thing at the moment is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, stated that at the moment of impact the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was traveling at cruising speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
&quot;This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine overflight operation at the time of the accident,&quot; he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, that is, the crew must be able to see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, accordingly the aircraft proceeds towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and better visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact location.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar match, it is likely that there was no loss of control or violation of the flight path before the impact.
Dispersal of aircraft debris in a limited area:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A scatterplot of the aircraft debris indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of impact with land.
No fire or explosion was reported.
No evidence of an explosion or fire was recorded at the scene of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with land.
During field work, the remains of the plane were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show footage of what is likely to be a breakup along the said route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in an area larger than the demarcation area, no remains of the helicopter were found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact occurred while the helicopter was still intact.
Mexico&#39;s Health Insurance Institute has begun research on the gene that causes obesity
The Health Insurance Institute is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for childhood and adolescent obesity. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to uncover the gene that causes obesity in children and young people. The research entitled &quot;Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents&quot; will provide results related to overweight.
In the report, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been established.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without authorization, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in the Valle de México, where tests will be carried out on young people every Sunday from 8 am.
He emphasized that the research started in the Sports Center of Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and since October 8 this activity is also carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (East of the State of Mexico).
Once data from 500 to 600 children have been obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics when it comes to the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years old, with parental consent and supervision, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He specified that every Saturday all participants are taken anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined and genes are examined (they try to identify genes that are involved in the formation childhood obesity).
Cruz López said this research reflects the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in children&#39;s weight.
&#39;Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in only six years there was an increase in obesity by 77% in boys and by 47% in girls. A dramatic increase also occurred in the case of overweight&#39;, said an expert from the IMSS.
He stated that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that a country&#39;s population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Native American genetic makeup, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the children&#39;s condition, which will determine if they exhibit any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
For now, the information is confidential, and doctors pass it on to parents in writing, explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order for their children to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle meaning a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the television all day and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Being overweight is also caused by high caloric intake, i.e. higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic load, which is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in Asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, independent of climatic conditions and temperature
If paving was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan Region of Valle de México, pointed out Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if construction and maintenance asphalt pavements were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or it would even be possible to eliminate them completely.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Potholes, which he delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should result in a mixture having similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low , so at high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules called asphaltenes and low molecular weight ones called maltenes. Together, they give asphalt its typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the durability of asphalt in streets is not uniform, but changes throughout the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Between the uppermost layers is an asphalt insert, made of small pebbles embedded in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that makes up the liner is covered with asphalt.
When cars pass by or when pressure is created, it is thus possible for the forces in the pavement to be well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, they would decompose even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the final layer, called the casing, is placed on top of the asphalt liner, consisting of fine stone, i.e. sand also embedded in the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with vehicle rims, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and must provide road friction.
Since it will be subjected to heavy loads as part of the paving, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken with the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, is also a very important factor to keep in mind. Water in particular has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt liner.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads in and it is difficult for it to get out, this causes the softening of all the layers of the paving and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the formation of potholes, the casing film is damaged first and then the asphalt liner is damaged. However, damage does not occur in one moment, but is a gradual process that should be stopped at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes, so the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must match the vehicle load and ensure that this load is not exceeded. This is the only way we can prevent the frequent occurrence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and the research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow potholes to be easily repaired without having to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from Valle lack to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyzes of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multi-miss.
Valle del Cauca again fell short of the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winner&#39;s podium, receiving a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multiple Miss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday&#39;s final in Cartagena, in which Miss Atlántico won and took the scepter, the aforementioned department won the 14th title of the first multi-miss. Melina thus joined the multitudes of women from Valle del Cauca who came within reach of the winning crown, but in the end were declared the first multi-misses. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question that many ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who showed in all the previous rounds that she has what it takes to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing that she became the Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took home the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name her only the First Multiple Miss is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question: &quot;Which book did you like the most and why?&quot;, asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the literary editor Leamos.
The candidate answered the question:
&quot;I read a lot. I strongly believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of culturalization. The book that influenced me the most in my childhood was &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, a very deep book.
I am currently reading &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book called &quot;El ardor de la sangre&quot;.
This answer was not liked, firstly because of the term &quot;culturalizing&quot; and secondly, because the candidate did not explain how the individual mentioned books made an impression on her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: &quot;The world is wise, what is meant to happen, will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book.”
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite positions.
A Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, the most celebrated from the start and the one who had won all the previous awards (the Oster Gastronomic Challenge, the public title for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) aroused the envy of the other candidates, stressed the queen, who then she burned on stage.
It was evident during the first presentation of the swimwear on the Hilton beach and during the two parades before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both, it was clear that she lacked the power and passion that the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the &quot;At Home&quot; program on Canal RCN, believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first multi-miss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up with the crown of the queen&quot;.
In addition, Valle has taken a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days, and this has not paid off for him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Pageant.
On a side note, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
&quot;In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects even before they enter the competition&quot;. she explained.
There is also speculation that candidate Valle lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and the fibrosis that was visible on her bottom. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her as Miss &quot;Natural Beauty&quot; for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, &quot;but the problems with the fibrosis on the bottom, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points only on the last day&quot;.
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the Valle native made a mistake by undergoing several surgeries.
&quot;Surgeries are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong point and here it took its toll&quot;.
Because of this award, which was given for the first time by the National Beauty Convention, after the swimsuit show there was a cruel prediction that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction Raymundo gave Melina so that he would not have to give her the ultimate crown in the end.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that today Melina began the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her thrilling success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
Such was the work of the Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A fingerprint expert from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th of last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc&#39;s supreme leader: &quot;Alfonso Can&quot; through fingerprint comparison.
Of the seven fingerprint experts who work in the CTI department, this week it was the turn of Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada who has worked in forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days trudging through the jungle to get to the location of the corpses that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle and, after completing the relevant courses, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week when the operation against the said Alfonso Can was carried out, Eliazar was told to take at least three days&#39; worth of clothing with him.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected one of them was the man who led the world&#39;s oldest guerrilla group. So they asked him to take the fingerprint card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the location where the corpse was found, he did not recognize him due to his physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in the area, no glasses, much slimmer.
But prints don&#39;t lie.
Along with a galton magnifier, ink and transplanter, and light, Eliazar began comparing the corpse&#39;s dactyl records with the card entries.
The eye did not fail him: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejada was assigned to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, whether he was indeed the supreme commander of the Farc.
Searching for clues
For the typist from Sijín de Cali, the appreciation shown to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operative service against &quot;Can&quot; is very significant.
A lot of people don&#39;t know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in the investigation of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of those caught.
When caught, many criminals present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief leaned to take out the safe full of jewelry and money.
Walls are difficult because they are not designed to take fingerprints, but in this case we were able to get a print of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts&quot;, he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in a murder case.
Not long ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Upon investigation, it was determined that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and indeed the print on the bottle confirmed this.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed the murderer, it is clear that he appeared at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that objects are &quot;rubbed with chemical or physical reactive agents.&quot;
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to collect them.
Then the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or to the Registry.
&quot;The problem is that at the moment there are still many Colombians whose data is not entered anywhere&quot;, said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it appears on the CSI TV show.
Just as all that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch leaves a mark.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
&quot;Outrageous&quot; protest in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to set up tents.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York City officials on Tuesday as they sought a court order to re-enter the Manhattan square from which they were escorted out earlier in the day. They then tried to take over another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get there thanks to a court order allowing the &quot;outraged&quot; to return to camp on the site. A second part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park in the north of the city, where further arrests took place.
&quot;If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the &quot;outraged&quot; to the eviction of the camp ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg himself, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the site and allowing the protesters to continue camping there.
In addition, another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parsonage property of Trinity Church were also occupied by &quot;outrages&quot;.
They managed to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the protesters. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw some journalists being handcuffed as well.
The organization assures that several hundred people settled on the site. A delegation of religious leaders also came to show their support and also try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Piazza Zuccotti, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even carried and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to officers patrolling the square, causing &quot;some small clashes,&quot; said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; movement or using &quot;laws that were published after the occupation began, or denying protesters access to a park with shops or other places they used to use.&quot;
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city has suspended the reopening of the public space and warned the protesters that local laws do not allow them to return the tents and sleeping bags.
The city&#39;s top official personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the protesters were &quot;breaking the law&quot;.
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming &quot;a place where people didn&#39;t go to protest, but to break laws and in some cases hurt others&quot; because &quot;some businesses had received threatening letters&quot; and &quot;neighbors were worried about their quality of life.&quot;
&quot;The morning evacuation was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people,&quot; added a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of &quot;not respecting freedom of expression.&quot;
Representatives of the Occupy Wall Street movement also said they planned to organize &quot;major events&quot; on Thursday in cooperation with community and union organizations to mark two months of protests. They started on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will portray the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other notable Canadians, he will appear on the TV program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen&#39;s assistant in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, a lifeguard in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, a bunny in &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of the musician of the year Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other notable Canadians, will appear on the Dec. 1 telecast of &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; as the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from the TV program, in which Anderson, also known for her Internet home porn videos, appears with her ex-husband, &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot; engine Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a baby Jesus doll in a manger.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently acted as a presenter on Charlie Sheen&#39;s &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; tour, will appear on the scene.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special will feature Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a &quot;fox&quot; at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is coming back to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, thus ending the period of decline that began in March
Paralyzed since March last year, Japan&#39;s economy is now recovering from a devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put material losses at $300,000 million, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September was in such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japanese people the tax year starts in March 2012 - also predict the greatest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery, which is necessary for the reconstruction of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Enterprises increased their investments by 1.1%, expenses will decrease by 0.9% compared to the period January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy comes entirely from the impulse to use the crisis to emerge stronger or to restore infrastructure. It&#39;s about using scarcity to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up. Especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan&#39;s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Flows have been handed to the internal market as the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the &quot;rescue assets&quot; for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time it is a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is a negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to September precisely to the exchange rate of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege EU peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda&#39;s government is cautious.
&quot;We must pay attention to risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
An indicator that predicts stiffness in the world economy showed that the economies of major powers are slowing.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even fell below the average, which is at the level of 100. It reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be passed but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With quick and risky margin guarantees and uncertainty reigning again, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in the labyrinth leading to the exit from Europe&#39;s major debt crisis.
The assumption that the &quot;agreement&quot; of the new transitional Greek government is due more to the demands of Brussels than to the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days he was given on his appointment were likely to be short to implement them, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said the new austerity measures he will not support in any case and repeated his demand to call new elections on the expected date of February 19.
&quot;The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of October 26&quot;, declared Papadimos yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, a reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not clear any doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else&quot;.
The leader of the Conservatives went a little too far in his address to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are supposed to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he declared that he would not support or sign any commitment regarding the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angered by the impact caused by Papandre&#39;s fiddling with the referendum, emphasized yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and representatives of the main parties sign &quot;a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible&quot;.
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from the Troika will return &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens and negotiate with the new government about &quot;what it needs to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
The Greek spinner still has a little while to knit.
Queen Sofia: &quot;There are tools for progress and hope&quot;
The Queen highlights Spain&#39;s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain has &quot;achieved an important position at the global level in terms of microfinance&quot;.
Yesterday, Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become the planet&#39;s second donor in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is that &quot;it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It is it&#39;s a tool based on trust in a person&quot;.
Yesterday, the Queen opened the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid, believing that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that this kind of operation &quot;is absolutely necessary&quot; for us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. &quot;In particular, it is about fulfilling goals to achieve a reduction by half of the number of people who live on less than one dollar a day, that is, the amount that defines the poverty threshold&quot;.
Spain &quot;will continue to work&quot; and expand the network of volunteers &quot;in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly&quot;, emphasized Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, &quot;will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women&quot;, to whom these loans are primarily intended.
&quot;We have already achieved a lot&quot; and &quot;many challenges are still ahead&quot;.
The summit on microloans should not only be a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support &quot;basic goals&quot;.
Her Majesty explained that the aim is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015, and for 100 million families to rise above the poverty line where they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries of the world after &quot;the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, embarked on this journey,&quot; the queen said, adding that it was &quot;an act of justice and necessary recognition.&quot;
She described the father of this tool as &quot;an admirable idealist who embarked on the path of fighting poverty&quot;. She became familiar with his work 15 years ago, when she went to Bangladesh to learn first-hand about his lending policy.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Côte d&#39;Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. &quot;At all these meetings I could note a constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned yesterday the title of &quot;head of the family &quot;, which was awarded to her in Valladolid by the &quot;movement of the poor&quot;.
Queen Sofia ended her speech by calling on the participants to engage in discussions and find solutions to enable the fight against poverty to continue.
&quot;The Ethical Imperative&quot;
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; that must be followed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the Balohobyt period, because this cooperation is a &quot;permanent obligation&quot;.
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a &quot;serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty&quot;, and now more than ever the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microloans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success, which celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to people to whom everyone else closes the door. The mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants to the city, which &quot;opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious&quot;.
The CDU proposes to elect the European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, without any serious problems for the chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it became one only in the autumn, mainly to satisfy party members who consider the government&#39;s policy today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates were against and 10 abstained.
The several-minute standing ovation at the end of Angela Merkel&#39;s speech and then a few hours later for Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the answer to the crisis is &quot;not less Europe, but more Europe&quot;.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro&quot;.
According to the chancellor, &quot;the time for change has come&quot; in Europe.
This could take the form of changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union&#39;s control over the budgetary policies of the eurozone member states, but it could also result in the election of the president of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage &quot;in order to give Europe one face&quot;.
Such, in any case, is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Great Britain is opposed, and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is set.
In the same way, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Concerned to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to win the Congress by talking about &quot;small&quot; European states or states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of &quot;French-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel did not cite France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago a bloody battle took place near Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon&#39;s army.
What constitutes unemployment fraud?
After the subsidies, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against work incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Assistance Office, where he will deliver a speech on the recurring theme since 2007 of the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, due to budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of sick leave on private sector workers before they start taking sick pay.
To put it plainly, without the company&#39;s consent, an employee who falls ill would lose four days&#39; wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day of unpaid sick leave (so far they have no sick leave compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching the topic of fraud, this time focused on malpractices linked to work incapacity.
&quot;The checks will be much more extensive and, in addition: if you are caught, you will return&quot;, warned Xavier Bertrand in an interview given to the station RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth about disability wrongdoing.
These have in fact been subject to constant monitoring since 2002 and a political onslaught that has borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let&#39;s stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d&#39;assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance company), in 2006 more than 237 million euros of daily benefits were paid out.
According to the French Institute for research and documentation in the health sector, in 2008, per diems, with their 11.3 billion euros, represented 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity allowances and occupational accidents and 54% related to incapacity for work, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
That is, only 2.5% of healthcare costs.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of sick leave in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that hides some variation: another survey published in 2007 on the jobs website Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a sick day.
Another study, this time conducted by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010, 37.8% of incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to sick leave than elsewhere.
One long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS (National Research Center) researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated between 10% and 11.8% in France against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on sick leave represents only a very small part compared to undeclared work.
As far as scams go, these are only on a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks aimed at work incapacity of more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM stated that out of 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 carried out due to short-term incapacity were &quot;unauthorized or too long&quot;, i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked incapacities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of &quot;not adjusted or unauthorized&quot; were counted for 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
So a total of 169,000 &quot;unauthorized&quot; cases for several million employees who were unable to work.
A number that represents much less than the number representing work in the black.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of a June report on the issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout to get its economy back on track.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish the task.
&quot;In order to get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan,&quot; the prime minister said as he made his first public speech at the start of a confidence vote debate in parliament on Wednesday.
Implementing the decisions taken on October 27 at the Eurozone summit will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, as our country&#39;s participation in the Eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted the country&#39;s public deficit would be &quot;around 9%&quot; of gross domestic product between now and the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday voiced his support for measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit to any additional austerity measures.
&quot;We will not raise our hands for any new measures&quot;, emphasized Samaras at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
We have agreed targets for reducing the deficit and debt and fighting waste, but we oppose any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
To Mr. Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economy and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU will not unlock the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties that will support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word is enough and that he will not sign anything under external pressure .
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says a commission of experts
Canadians are being denied death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada.
On palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions along those lines.
That&#39;s one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts working in a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government amend the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia where this choice appears necessary in a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cite a recent poll by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.&quot;
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This average is valid for all of Canada, while the province of Québec has the highest number with 86% of people dying in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&#39;s authors reach conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to make any changes to the criminal law surrounding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who also checked all the countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuses in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on unauthorized or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday during a teleconference more than numerous cases of these mistakes in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
&quot;Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal&quot;.
&quot;Assisted suicide is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are pro-euthanasia
Recall that according to a survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people at the end of life to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
When it comes to people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the people interviewed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing a patient&#39;s care, the situation is less clear, the report&#39;s authors say.
Also in their list of recommendations, they suggest that the criminal law states that withdrawing from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a crime.
The expert commission also requires that medical professionals be educated on the duty to respect refusal of end-of-life treatment without fear of criminal prosecution.
On palliative care, the commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health care facilities, the commission calls for it to be considered euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society&#39;s expert report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the experts-signatories of the report as &quot;extreme&quot; because, among other things, it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
&quot;This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask to be helped to commit suicide&quot;, says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé of the news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For &quot;in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions&quot;.
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a &#39;manifesto for euthanasia&#39;&quot;.
Margaret Somerville, herself a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly skeptical of the report&#39;s data regarding the absence of wrongdoing in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus Talks &#39;Conspiracy&#39;
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressures on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad intensified, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting them and talking about a &quot;plot&quot; against his country.
Two days after Syria&#39;s membership of the Arab League was suspended, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria&#39;s neighboring countries, took a stand in favor of President Assad&#39;s departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to &quot;hand over power&quot; in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime&#39;s military forces were killed.
&quot;If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; said the king of Jordan, a country neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that efforts dedicated to Turkish mediation with the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
&quot;Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,&quot; he said, referring to neighboring Syria, towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States rejoiced at the &quot;strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the dishonest behavior of the Syrian regime&quot; following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
&quot;The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly hard line&quot; against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.
As reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, during this time 16 civilians and 19 members of pro-regime forces were killed in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed &quot;during gunfights and concentrated fire from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar&quot; in the Homs region.
Nevertheless, at a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Mouallem, estimated that the country &quot;set out on the way out of the crisis&quot;.
After all, he also reacted vividly to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus&#39;s membership, which, according to him, represents a &quot;dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;will not bow down&quot;, he added, assuring that &quot;conspiracies against Syria will not succeed&quot;.
Following its decision to suspend Syria&#39;s membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a &quot;mechanism for the protection of civilians&quot; and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorable to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by a regime that he says is behaving &quot;paranoid&quot;.
A new special meeting of the League is being convened in Rabat tomorrow to take a position on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on December 2 and which specifically envisaged the withdrawal of the armies from the strife-torn cities and the release of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday dismissed the Arab League&#39;s decision as &quot;wrong&quot;, while China urged Syria to accept a plan to resolve the crisis, while avoiding any support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices from the Italians
Italy&#39;s next prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include &quot;victims&quot; to regain credibility lost in the final months of Berlusconi&#39;s rule.
The former European Commissioner held talks with political parties yesterday before meeting trade union and employer representatives today.
He should form a relatively lean cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
&quot;Monti talked about an important program with many victims,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting the prime minister-designate.
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Yesterday, Mario Monti commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In a &quot;democracy, precise deadlines apply&quot; when it comes to the preparation of the government and its program, he emphasized, adding that he is &quot;sure that the markets will be patient and understand&quot;.
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by markets, but concerns resurfaced after an unexpected fall in eurozone industrial production in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should assemble a team including mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include &quot;politicians&quot;.
He expressed his belief that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of the Parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy &quot;again a strong link&quot; in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that &quot;even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change&quot;.
The European Union is convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of a balanced budget in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, and is demanding new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria business union, Emma Marcegagliová, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy &quot;because a country that does not show growth cannot maintain deficit parameters&quot;.
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, a &quot;professor&quot; symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, &quot;a call to seriousness&quot; and a &quot;different Italy&quot;, represents an &quot;epochal change&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;Berlusconism&quot; .
The big unknown will be the lifespan of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has until April 2012 to place government bonds worth 200 billion euros.
Soviet scientist helped Iran&#39;s nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for an atomic weapon, a US-based non-governmental organization specializing in atomic risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other leaked documents from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its &quot;serious concern&quot; about the &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, drawing extensively on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades from the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), where he should have been engaged in the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to leave the center to found a company producing &quot;nano-diamonds&quot; in Kyiv.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was to collaborate from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian program.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls &quot;clear evidence that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran&quot; was based &quot;on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew the method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency - worked during a substantial part of his working careers on this technology within the military nuclear program of the country from which it originates&quot;.
Anti-Muslim crimes and misdemeanors up 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, crimes and misdemeanors targeting Muslims rose by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or increased little over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in anti-Catholic violence, a 4% decrease in anti-Jewish offenses and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious criminal acts and torts.
The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
&quot;After a decrease in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and offenses rise again&quot;, emphasized the Human Rights First organization dealing with human rights, &quot;the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant&quot;, the organization added in its communique.
&quot;Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; adds one of the organization&#39;s senior officials, Paul Legendre.
&quot;The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these atrocities,&quot; he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reporting of &quot;hate crimes.&quot;
The &quot;hate crime&quot; in US federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legal order was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color, religion, national origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and becoming more like Facebook
Microblogging site Twitter rolled out design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, somewhat resembling its Facebook services.
The new &quot;activity&quot; and &quot;name&quot; menus allow you to better and directly know the activity of other people who follow you or of people whose replies (&quot;tweets&quot;) you follow.
This lets you know if they allow you to follow posts, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have favorite posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter was tested &quot;in August on a small percentage of users&quot; before being rolled out across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with somewhat incomprehensible terms (RT for re-spreading someone else&#39;s post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s&#39;ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their &quot;tweets&quot; assess the significance of this innovation in different ways.
&quot;It&#39;s pointless, takes up a lot of space, and looks too much like Facebook,&quot; writes @jemb123.
&quot;The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter,&quot; posted @dannykronstrom.
Austria
writing the golden rule about a balanced budget into the constitution
The government of the grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write the &quot;golden rule&quot; of budget policy into the constitution with the aim of reducing the public deficit and thus avoiding a possible downgrade of Austria&#39;s rating by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt, at 74.6%, is well above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If Austria&#39;s solvency was reduced by just one single grade from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest every year,&quot; argued the Christian Democrat Christian Democrat Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus follows up on the request of the summit of the Eurozone countries held in Brussels on October 26, 2011, where the heads of state and government strongly requested that by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of a balance of public accounts should be written into the constitution or a law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the &quot;German model&quot;, Germany was the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule&quot;.
Until 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting from 2017, the federal state&#39;s public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as the municipalities, they will have to show a balanced budget.
The goal is to bring the public debt below the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 horizon.

Noda threatens a new intervention in the foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if he were to continue strengthening.
&quot;We will intervene as we did last time if we find too much volatility&quot; in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken a record against the dollar that had stood since 1945.
But only since then has it risen regularly, supported by purchases by investors who consider it a &quot;safe haven&quot; in the uncertain times of the global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell back below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar, close to the levels that prompted the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency hurts the island&#39;s exports by raising the price of Made in Japan products and reducing the value of the revenue Japanese firms receive from abroad when converted into domestic currency.
&quot;Japan is recovering&quot; from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the country&#39;s northeast, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that the appreciation of the yen will kill the fragile recovery still in its infancy.
The world&#39;s third largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to a survey of growth in exports and household consumption burdened by the disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect &quot;Japan&#39;s national economy&quot;.
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its policy and monetary councils on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution&#39;s multiple governor Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that the BoJ had already taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot; suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities and Exchange Commission increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5 trillion yen (47 billion euros) and raised to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling on the amount it spends on purchases of various securities with the aim of flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, stock markets crash
The risk of debt crisis contagion continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the weak countries&#39; rates continue to rise.
European stock markets, still worried about the stability of the Eurozone, fall into negative expectations today, Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 a.m. the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
&quot;With new tensions surrounding the debt yields of struggling eurozone countries, equity markets around the world continue to pare recent gains&quot;.
&quot;Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo closed down 0.7%, which it suffered as market participants worried about Europe&#39;s ability to deal with the debt crisis.
&quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe, and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized,&quot; estimates Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This rekindling of uncertainty about the future of the eurozone is hurting the currency itself, which continued its slide on Tuesday.
The euro is hitting its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday that would allow countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This morning, Tuesday, the Italian 10-year bond yield is at 6.85% and the Spanish 10-year bond yield is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly asked the markets for time to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the October 27 Eurozone summit will be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government.
Spain is once again in the bullish line of markets as the country holds parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The difference in rates (&quot;spread&quot;) between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical high.
In anticipation of figures announcing eurozone growth
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, driven mainly by household consumption, slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, France&#39;s National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised down the second quarter figures to a 0.1% drop in GDP instead of stagnation.
And in truth, it&#39;s the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, during the same period, Germany registered a growth of 0.5%.
The first estimates for the entire eurozone are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must prevail over dogmas
If there&#39;s any topic that can&#39;t be captured on short-term balance sheets or emotion, it&#39;s energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is only natural that the election meeting should be an opportunity to think about such investments and the place that nuclear power occupies.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are currently 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will cause the demand for electricity to double between now and 2050, if we do not want to deprive a significant part of the world&#39;s population of important parts of life.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be faced in order to continue to generate electricity, and we cannot forget the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a topic that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor in Switzerland, which considers it correct to build only the latest generation power plants.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name at least some countries, continue with their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by resuming the construction of one plant suspended after the Three Mile Island plant accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, and a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European wind power champion, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the biggest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, causing CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices to be 65% and 65% higher respectively. 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay an electricity bill 40% higher than what French households pay.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy represents a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining industry on national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a sharp increase in the price of electricity, rendering illusory the beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay, just as they are not fundamentally opposed to this energy, as opinion polls show.
Let us recall that the energy policy of our country made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 downstream jobs.
A heavily exporting industry draws a large number of small and medium-sized specialized enterprises to international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to abandon nuclear, it would sacrifice a significant number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the 6 billion euros a year that the country earns from exporting nuclear equipment and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while its manufacturer is scheduled for bankruptcy?
In solving the energy equation, one must admit that there is no magical source for energy production, and indeed no diabolical one.
The development of low CO2, nuclear and renewable energy equipment by the French industrial group AREVA testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute must.
In France, we have the National Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of the new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accidents.
The only one at Three Mile Island occurred under normal operating conditions and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor design and inexcusable human error caused the drama.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it did from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR type reactor represents a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While he is being considered by all those interested in building a nuclear power plant, stopping its construction at Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to rivals AREVA and EDF, clearing the way for them to take the lead in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate a debate so crucial to our country&#39;s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overloading of the police, the courts and the administration subjected to the politics of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the &quot;country of human rights&quot; that France boasts of.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see Libération of May 23) declared that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, masons and waitresses&quot;.
But so far, it has rarely been discussed from an economic perspective.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone in 1976 when he declared that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with 2 million immigrant workers&quot; and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France &quot;cannot accept all the misery of the world &quot;.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of hordes of Polish plumbers on French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we deign to extend to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limits himself to banalities when he states that common development will make it possible to solve our &quot;migration problem&quot;.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may be valid in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): there is a wide consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and hurts employment.
Concerns about the impact caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled ones, and create downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complements than substitutes for French workers by doing jobs in sectors with a shortage of workers.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to supply jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anesthetists, these additions between French and migrants make the arrival of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements will cause a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, averaging 1% of the total budget.
The World Labor Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany, one gray-haired immigrant at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (revenues minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his desire to fight for the missing percentages of growth &quot;with bare teeth&quot;.
The aforementioned teeth used to repel immigrants had just the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also a very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, after all, despite the fact that it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the XX. century, the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make an election, and make it as direct as possible.
However, it has been known since Napoleon that it was about ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an &quot;instrument of oppression&quot; as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, departmental organization and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just that and from the beginning a crisis of politics and democracy.
Admitting the error of the Greek yes-no referendum will in this respect have the value of a double revelation: revealing the necessity of a great return of political power, but also revealing the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic struggle have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer firing in the right direction.
There is nothing to be gained if we demand a series of national referendums conducted on a case-by-case basis and in a disorganized manner.
Blank exposed to a European absolutist monarch or leap with bound feet into the emptiness of the nationalist abyss: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a joint, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn&#39;t even know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
Indeed, it is the whole of Europe bowing to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its peoples.
There is an urgent need to return the governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the rule of the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will presuppose decisions at the European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After we have fought for a long time against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, today everyone is strongly demanding a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;be&quot; republicans.
A revolution in interests could not be enough for this.
This lesson still applies.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe and a true European democratic sovereignty.
Let&#39;s become Europeans to build Europe.
&quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world trade fair for smart cards will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, the year 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, phones with a SIM card) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The segment with the most support is contactless technology, which makes it possible to pay in public transport or make purchases simply by bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share should rise further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total smart card market (6.925 million cards).
After long trailing the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big chain stores work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to move into a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
&quot;Two large French companies have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,&quot; announced Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only the first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary for carrying out transactions.
&quot;They got delayed&quot;.
&quot;But their real boom should happen next year&quot;.
&quot;For the year 2012, we estimate their sales in the world at 80 to 120 million units&quot;, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
The Crédit Agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in the city of Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and associates will be equipped with a case enabling contactless payments.
Bank BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone contactless.
The terrorist front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-standing suspicions that there are ties between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerien sect Boko Haram are being confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria&#39;s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria &quot;became certain&quot; about it from now on.
&quot;The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them,&quot; he explained without elaborating.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help shed light on the links.
After being kidnapped by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the rubble after the strike, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terror axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several individuals in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian man who has long resided in Maiduguri, the northern Nigerian city that is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQMI and Sect.
&quot;It is progress, but without a doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram&quot;.
&quot;But it is possible&quot;.
&quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,&quot; says Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this &quot;support&quot; has become more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the issues raised by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quick success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; in the Hausa language, approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and demands strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its followers launch a struggle against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram followers became extremely active and increased their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government&#39;s response is still the same.
The army surrounds the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group becomes radicalized and leaves its base in the north.
On Christmas 2010, he carried out an assassination in the city of Jos, in which 80 people died, then another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it&#39;s Abuja again, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, worries all security specialists as of now.
Now that Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and iger and Somalis from Al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
In an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan last week in Nigeria, Alain Juppé said France was on alert and ready to &quot;pass on all information&quot;.
The world according to presidential candidates
On issues concerning China, Iran or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America govern the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point of the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or helping Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; nomination race, has threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and charge them &quot;for manipulating their currency,&quot; a hot topic in America fueled by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Even worse if this has to involve starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama&#39;s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with any sophisticated vision for foreign policy, almost choked on the &quot;smoothing&quot; attitude.
He called for tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama&#39;s current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in last place in the polls, remains unlistenable.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
&quot;If I am elected, I will imprison Iran&quot;, he declared boastfully.
&quot;If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.&quot;
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a tough stance against China&#39;s military threat as Beijing &quot;tries to develop nuclear capabilities&quot; - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has possessed an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the US military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and fellow candidate Michele Bachmann.
All of them are a far cry from 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and still won the Cold War.
They point out that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine on the issue of the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thereby attribute to him the label of weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population assesses the national security policy of President Obama, who eliminated Bin Laden, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to a stalemate.
And with arguments that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership position, Obama hits the right spot.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance gas pipeline directly connecting Eastern Europe to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has started operating.
It must supply gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will directly connect Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte together turned the control wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
Through this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow to Western Europe every year through the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the federal state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be supplied, an amount equal to the entire French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third gas pipeline on the same route is already being mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without it being routed through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing a bit of power: it becomes more difficult for them to pressure Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to a &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot;, referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that it is a politically sensitive topic.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe gained greater certainty in its purchases.
But it comes at the cost of weakening Europe&#39;s energy, as the project has created rifts between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Only 5 years ago, Russia managed to push through its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western gas-consuming states whose deposits are nearing their end.
&quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us&quot;, affirmed François Fillon at the ceremonial opening of this gas pipeline, demonstrating at what point large gas contracts are both political and economic matters.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom executives present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical feat.
The submarine pipeline is made of steel with a concrete jacket to protect it from the anchors of marine vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
&quot;Nearly a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed for safety reasons,&quot; says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipeline itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted anywhere along its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
One inspection platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it as the Swedes were less than eager to see a Russian state-owned company set up permanently off their coast.
&quot;In the event of a fault, we stop the flow of gas in less than 1 minute&quot;, explains Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, because the welds were designed so that a leak would occur once every 100,000 years.
The outside of the pipeline is inspected by an underwater robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is inspected by equipment that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the destination, after the entire three-day journey at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds a share of 51%.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, tasked with building and operating the pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely favorable.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transportation capacities to this company for a five-year, renewable contract.
&quot;Gazprom will make a profit from the total capacity, no matter what the amount of gas actually transported&quot;, explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs thus rose to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be recouped, since only Gazprom bears the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas exit gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to provide the joy of writing again.
It brings the scent of adventure, of hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its leaves of a faded white color that seems to have aged over time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born already in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides to launch a new designer but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes on the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique &quot;moleskin&quot; (imitation leather), which is used, for example, to modify the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine brought back to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far removed from the secret production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to construct an artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will attract the businessman as well as the student or professional.
The image of the Moleskine notebook belongs to the fact that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded people.
The small Italian company, which in its beginnings had 12 employees, today has almost a hundred and since 2008 has had two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and, through the FNAC chain of stores, to small boutiques in city centers, where he has been able to assert his identity.
&quot;We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of emails&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition &quot;Walk&quot;, where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
It also launched new leopard-like notebook boards in August at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases... The brand expands to a whole range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the proportion of unemployed disabled workers so high?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Handicapped opens today.
Despite the voluntarist public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it daunting?
&quot;No, underlines Éric Blanchet, general director of the Adapt association, which organizes the Week for the employment of the disabled.&quot;
&quot;The progress made in 15 years is remarkable.&quot;
&quot;At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher.&quot;
&quot;However, much remains to be done.&quot;
It must be said that there are still numerous obstacles for unemployed disabled people before they start working.
These are elderly people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a high school diploma and only 10,000 are disabled out of 2.3 million university students.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make returning to work particularly difficult, and which represent &quot;the heart of the problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the association Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses hire disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
It remains unspoken, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that interviewed managers had a &quot;poor level of knowledge about disabled people&quot; with &quot;an exaggerated idea of people in wheelchairs and psychological or mental deficiencies&quot;.
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from meeting the 1987 law&#39;s goal of employing 6% of disabled workers.
The last known figures, which come from 2008, indicate a state equal to 2.6%.
&quot;Now we&#39;re around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization tasked with collecting fees from businesses that don&#39;t comply with the law.
The proof is the number of &quot;fined&quot; companies, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty companies to 46,000 (from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law that increased contributions created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc.&quot;
&quot;But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, especially in large enterprises.&quot;
According to the Department of Labor, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: &quot;How lucky&quot;
Before they challenge the French national team (Bleus) on Tuesday evening (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was an association between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker&#39;s angry gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach had nothing but praise for his player.
&quot;I am very happy with Eden and his progress, also with the fact that he loves his country&quot;.
&quot;I want to move forward&quot;, assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, &quot;it&#39;s one and the same, he apologizes.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot;
“I need to clear my mark.
Hazard, spared against Romania on Thursday night for this game against France, comes to the Saint-Denis stadium to finally &quot;shine&quot;.
At the same time, the concept of &quot;joy&quot; cannot be neglected.
To play against the Bleus, who he supported from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I&#39;ve always been a fan,&quot; he says.
This necessarily adds even more to the &quot;special&quot; character of this meeting.
All the more because &quot;there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)&quot; opposite, he reminds.
&quot;We crossed paths immediately.&quot;
&quot;To be able to play against them is just a pleasure!&quot;
Good-hearted Leekens also mentioned &quot;pride&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; to win a &quot;match - holiday&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; to also note the quality of the &quot;neighbors&quot; that a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna, France &quot;became a team of a very high level again&quot;.
&quot;Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job,&quot; he enthused.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 towards... Brazil.
&quot;Our little Belgians will become big&quot;, he underlined.
&quot;We are building something right now, the players are ambitious, they have a healthy hunger.&quot;
&quot;You will realize it for the next matches&quot;. Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portugal coach Paulo Bento starts the tie against Bosnia Bosnia (22:00) this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
Both teams lacked realism on the way there.
&quot;At the end of those 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country&quot;.
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, at the helm of which he has been in charge since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is one match left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday&#39;s result (0-0) in the Bosnian hell of Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had the upper hand for more than an hour, but were unable to score such a rare goal to relieve them.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but it&#39;s a risk because we didn&#39;t score away.&quot;
But at home in their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident of progressing in front of a crowd that should create a seething cauldron, although the game certainly looks &quot;very close&quot;, says an optimistic but sharp-thinking Bento.
&quot;We expect a very balanced match, but we are completely convinced that we can have the upper hand&quot;, said the forty-two-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012&quot;, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
Friday&#39;s indecisive game in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn&#39;t score away,&quot; regrets Bento.
&quot;We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities&quot;, he added.
Just like in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so as not to &quot;give them time to think.&quot;
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
