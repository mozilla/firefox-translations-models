GOP strategy against Obama&#39;s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center calls such fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die from being struck by lightning.
After all, Republican attorneys have only recorded 300 cases of voter fraud in the US over the past ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the US individual states are responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in this spirit, since 2009, most US governments have promulgated new laws that make the process of voting or registering to vote more difficult.
This phenomenon took off after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights were introduced in 41 states in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register to vote on election day, and disenfranchise citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no US state required voters to present a photo ID.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian Act was upheld by the US Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities hurried to extend this procedure to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored such bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any government-issued photo ID.
Furthermore, about five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
In addition, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% African American, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000; Therefore, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that&#39;s not all.
Students, known as voters for leaning toward Democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their school-issued photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who tend to vote for Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, about twelve states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are US citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws in eight states that would cancel voter registration on Election Day.
They also limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These limitations have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register approximately 10 million residents.
However, measures taken after 2009 caused a drop in new voter registration in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early voting period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African Americans made up 33% of early voters, even though African American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They constituted only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of early voters.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the passage of laws that limit voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their vetoes.
The Attorney General of the United States even intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They managed to limit the damage to some extent.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics talk mainly about the bias of the approved laws and consider them an obvious effort to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states where these laws have been passed account for 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win a presidential election.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain already today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: To Get Screened or Not?
The PSA test sometimes gave erroneous results that were falsely negative or even falsely positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitancy of the men, who were already reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To get tested or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
In the studies conducted in the USA, a high level of contamination between the individual test groups was shown, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, noted a difference in mortality between patients who underwent an examination and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year gap that those who do not go for examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
I therefore recommend examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also a more at-risk group.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and types that are indolent.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and in these cases focus more on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their type of cancer is not aggressive and not life-threatening.
Rather, we suggest active surveillance and offer treatment in case of disease progression.
More and more often and with greater precision, we establish criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend taking the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyles appears to be the best means of reducing disease risks.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and exercised enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
&quot;If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,&quot; emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer is caused by heredity.
A certain percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for the Canadian Cancer Society, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
&quot;There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,&quot; says spokesman André Beaulieu, shaking his head.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Mass
Fertility and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease, according to SCC.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
&quot;Research suggests that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; the report adds.
Nutrition
The said organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
If consumed too much, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid cured meats, for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
&quot;They can cause damage to the body&#39;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; adds the report.
Vitamins
Recently, various researchers have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet produced clear conclusions.
Studies focusing on vitamin E are conflicting, according to the SCC.
Although, according to one of them, the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study is more likely to increase it.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu goes on to stress the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor.
&quot;Getting tested doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to get cancer.&quot;
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a justifiable stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And then there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
However, physicists are still not 100% certain that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a brand new particle that closely resembles the Higgs boson as predicted by the Standard Model.
New data released this week during a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but we still need all the data to be absolutely sure.
However, let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a Higgs boson, since the risks of error seem small, and see what it&#39;s really about.
In this world there is an absolutely indisputable law that no two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
There&#39;s no way around this rule - and don&#39;t try too hard or you&#39;ll hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that there is a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which no two particles can occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state&quot; roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
Physicists further divide particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find ordered citizens, or fermions, which obediently obey the Pauli principle.
And at the other end are the bosons, vile anarchists who value nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the (absolutely awesome, by the way) facility that is The Particle Adventure at Berkeley Labs: mesons, which we&#39;ll ignore here, and &quot;force particles,&quot; which propagate the great forces of nature and which are the Higgs boson probably related in some way.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you&#39;re reading this article, it&#39;s because of a boson of unusual banality: the photon, or &quot;particle of light,&quot; which is the &quot;carrier&quot; of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it &quot;disrupts&quot; the electromagnetic field in that particular place, similar to a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this &quot;disturbance&quot; an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) will arise, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, the &quot;carriers of force&quot;.
A more stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be &quot;disrupted&quot; in order for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very high energy values, similar to the frozen surface of a pond, which only a very large boulder will clear.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - the Large Hadron Collider with welcoming beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to be able to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and matter.
Neither all particles nor all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don&#39;t - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick on the fridge by itself.
And anyway, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have some mass, while others (such as a photon, let&#39;s look at it) do not.
And Ms. Nováková asks what all these researches are for, what will they &quot;bring us&quot;?
From a science perspective, this is a confirmation of the validity of the Standard Model (SM), allowing physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and SM predictions.
In addition, quite a few physicists literally wish to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of &quot;new physics&quot; and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not provide any clarification of gravity (whoah!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the cosmic mass (again whoah!).
However, the CERN facility has so far not discovered such contradictions.
Responses
The responses of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Novák can only be predicted with great difficulty, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Behold: in the very early 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would spark.
They envisioned a scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first steady laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I&#39;ve already said - the laser was initially considered as such a &quot;lab toy &quot;.
Just imagine it...
And besides, application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn&#39;t initially plan it that way, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC must necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that one really never knows...
Palliative Care - The best way to end your life... | Le Devoir
Through its Commission on Dying with Dignity, Quebec has recently become involved in the delicate issue of end-of-life.
The debate should continue before long and a bill is being prepared at the same time.
Much work remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look into this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating away at him gave him a two-year reprieve.
&quot;They gave me five years to live and now it&#39;s seven,&quot; he says emotionlessly on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
&quot;But it&#39;s still a shock, you can&#39;t prepare for this,&quot; he adds.
The disease has done its work: the immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or to eat alone.
He looks resignedly at the delicious looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage to an ordinary death.
&quot;My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me,&quot; he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
&quot;You learn throughout your life that men urinate standing up,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
To return to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
&quot;It depends on the abilities of the person&quot; whether he accepts the return, says the psychologist.
According to many palliative care professionals, the crucial moments occur at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them do not provide them with so-called &quot;curative&quot; care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die &quot;from suffocation while fully conscious&quot;.
But the illness allowed me to discover my children.
&quot;I have good children,&quot; he adds.
&quot;I have no more wishes in life,&quot; she says, then allows us to put her on a respirator.
Nevertheless, he is still looking forward to his son&#39;s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like, which starts when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little if we consider that we all die one day.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it&#39;s a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
For example, when a person is dying, they can be given a sip of brandy or Pepsi, depending on their taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they carried beer to Mr X who died later that night.
His son will finish his beer this morning in honor of his late father.
&quot;We help patients as well as their loved ones,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, director of the nursing service.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, the days go one after the other, but they are not alike.
Next to a 93-year-old man rejoicing in his last reunion with his family, thoroughly propped up on pillows as they toast him in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying every option to survive.
&quot;For six months now, there have always been three to five beds intended for people with cancer under the age of 45,&quot; says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concern.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come here from their homes, and 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It says 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, care designed to ease suffering once a person reaches the end of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home .
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Greater Montréal Region, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental inaccessibility of health care in Quebec that leads many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the best in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelová, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all persons have access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be agreed to.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in excruciating pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is concerned that patients may not request euthanasia because they are not receiving appropriate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hopes for Hélène Richard&#39;s survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I was ending treatment, she said she regretted giving up the fight, she tells us.
And at the same time she was telling me that it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative care team relieves their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is definitely not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal Region, patients resist pain management in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either intermittently or continuously.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient whose pain is not relieved will have an increasing possibility of access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not sedated always say the same thing: &quot;I want to die&quot;.
But that doesn&#39;t always necessarily mean &quot;I want you to euthanize me&quot;, it means more &quot;I want you to relieve me of pain&quot;.
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and experts on the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing &quot;system&quot; in which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mobsters mix.
This &quot;industry&quot; was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially between the years 1990 and 2000.
&quot;It&#39;s interesting how the system has crumbled since we took major measures,&quot; says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief, wryly.
Thanks to him, a scandal erupted in 2011 following a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which the then Liberal Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest, approved only after long delays.
The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of public officials.
&quot;Since the investigation began in 2010,&quot; he says, &quot;the Department of Transportation alone has saved a billion dollars in contracts,&quot; when some people restrained their instincts to get a share of them!
Charbonneau&#39;s commission &quot;has already led to the resignation of two mayors,&quot; he adds, hoping to &quot;expose the cunning of some people.&quot;
Permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also joining the fight with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of &quot;Marteau&#39;s gang&quot;, who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal &quot;cartel of money conduits&quot; significantly reduced the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of raids and indicted a number of municipal councilors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality, for fraud and corruption.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec&#39;s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal traffic engineers and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have already received formal charges.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when he explained to the commission the mechanism of the &quot;system&quot; of obtaining public contracts.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montréal to an intermediary connected to the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000, donating more than C$88,000 (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to the then-incumbent Liberals.
He also pleaded guilty to organizing illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money conduits whose prices he inflated
In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption was very active.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: over ten years, he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pocket money from construction companies totaling $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money conduits, for which he inflated the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they were paid bonuses for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false overtime.
The mayor&#39;s party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of unabashedly turning a blind eye to a concurrent budget that brought dirty money into his coffers.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a wide-ranging crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to developers right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will finally be launched, he says it is &quot;pulling strings to understand the workings of the ant-soaked system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits&quot;.
According to her, the process is &quot;painful but positive&quot;.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and ensure oversight so that these questionable practices cannot return.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that &quot;public officials embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but he is particularly concerned about the role of &quot;deputies informed of this ruse&quot; if they did not get caught up in these scams!
He estimates that 70% of the financing of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and adds ironically: &quot;I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s just a weak decoction of reality.&quot;
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not solve the situation, he says: &quot;Until election expenses are strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics.&quot;
He proposes a comprehensive review of the system of public procurement and party funding: &quot;We cannot sink any further; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can build again on firmer foundations and with greater control and compliance with the law.&quot;
If the story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau advises all those who mock him to look in their own backyard...
&quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot;
You set a whole new pace with PSG this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all the individuals went together, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players came to us.
Every day I get closer to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of my game.
And it&#39;s easier during matches.
Everything happens very fast in football.
But I&#39;m not losing my mind.
From my beginnings in the preparatory school at INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I always moved up individual steps.
So you are taking advantage of the competitive environment established by Carlo Ancelotti...
The signings from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training session is essential.
And it follows that a player like me has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
And in addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive say at the right moment?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in the 1st league and is among the best European coaches.
He has vast experience and has won many titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had a comforting interview with him in January.
I had a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you see PSG&#39;s first part of the season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took away our leading position.
But we remain behind.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we reached the last eight very easily.
What is your club&#39;s goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first against Porto so we can play in the round of 16 second leg at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the resources to make this plan a reality.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We still lacked a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had what it takes to win.
We had an excellent season.
We collected 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are the clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will be successful this year.
Although big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also chasing the title, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It&#39;s not unusual to expect a lot from us given what&#39;s been invested here and the kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It&#39;s a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there&#39;s still something they blame us for in the newspapers, it&#39;s not exactly pleasant.
One wonders what more people could want from you.
Of course, you can&#39;t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a play style.
You need time to build a team.
We proved in the Champions League that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who failed to reach the round of 16 for the second season, and they also invested big!
Given the amounts invested, you would expect to be 15 points ahead of the others!
You are insulting other clubs and the French league by doing so.
The clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not do very well last season, moved to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing League 1 is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties we managed to win.
It seems as if PSG are relying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic&#39;s performances for everything.
It&#39;s good that they say there is a &quot;Zlatan addiction&quot;.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
That&#39;s what he came here for and he&#39;s proving he&#39;s a League 1 star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the person and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to up their game as well.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I couldn&#39;t play the way I would have imagined.
But I experienced it and came out stronger.
Today I manage to play good matches in the national team as well.
And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been hoping for since joining the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to be exemplary in our conduct.
How do you see Didier Deschamps&#39; first months in charge of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in the qualification for the World Cup.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can get excited about victory.
Laurent Blanc was like that too.
But I don&#39;t want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the 1-1 draw in Spain on October 16th a solid starting game?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (convertible, however, to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which enables the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to 2 dollars, today it hovers around 10 dollars (an overview of the exchange rates is given on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world&#39;s exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
He describes Bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual money&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar and the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to ordinary money&quot;.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like &quot;credits&quot; used to progress in a video game that one earns by playing or that one can buy (and sometimes trade back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are custodians of the current account book, controllers, issuers of money, and both buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses using email.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public ledger that is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction in this ledger.
It takes place by solving a mathematical problem given to computers, the solver of which, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the file cutting phase; i.e. about transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers will &quot;take over&quot; this new transaction and add a number to it, only then &quot;chop&quot; the whole.
The goal is to find a number that gives a specific fingerprint (lots of leading zeros).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily check its correctness.
The transaction then appears indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would alter the print.
If the user wanted to fraudulently pay twice with the same money very quickly (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, since each of them has a different fingerprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 Bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to hundred millionths, so there is room for margin...
The difficulty of the given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and stored Bitcoins have been stolen.
&quot;The exploited loophole is not related to the protocol itself,&quot; assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks money laundering possibilities thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia reject donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the ledger of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
&quot;Huge discounts&quot; were launched in November.
&quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; exults Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a bitcoin-to-gold exchange.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of an educational book about this money, has great faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions, which makes it cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up at dealers, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to tell the address, which can be &quot;photographed and recognized&quot; with the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement towards challenging hierarchical systems and moving towards more horizontal systems.
&quot;It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a decisive year,&quot; he predicts.
In addition, the ECB in its report foresees a reassessment of the various risks that are considered to be elevated today if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what else?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of their territory and for the Afghan people to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside suffered the greatest harm, whom we punished because we considered them to be terrorists.
And we too, after all we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often rural people who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They now enjoy tolerance and frequent aid from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the tops of the mountains covered with almond trees thanks to French loans, was orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul unattacked, escorted by helicopters.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable advance between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty then and the country was in blood and fire due to fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, who have been completely controlled by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved in our time.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries from the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seizing government land that they sold as building plots to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and taking advantage of huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They have discredited themselves; moreover, most of them have never even been in combat.
From what I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity will leave: capital flight is significant.
Young people are already tired of the war and the ideologies associated with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and were intrigued by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, both girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the previous parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes cell phones; they watch television and Turkish series that show the modern world everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand at its head be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias, which will be outside the control of the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should have enjoyed a certain degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is functioning, no vital irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be essential.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed vast mineral wealth.
And this only fueled the feeling that the Western powers were only there to seize it.
But without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site and the means to transport raw materials over the mountains, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have all but abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) to explore the sprawling Buddhist compound to maintain its role as the province&#39;s most important employer.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of its imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls&#39; and boys&#39; lyceums, French departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, there has been a &quot;getting heart and soul&quot; initiative attempting the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, within which the &quot;civil-army steps&quot; service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic) operated, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved thanks to numerous French NGOs, a series of successes in the field of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which involved many local workers, helped to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil conservation and expansion of cultivated area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from insurgencies led by foreign groups, these farmers, they say, wish to achieve a small amount of civil assistance in their favor that would be properly controlled and directly affect them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian constitution
President Muhammad Morsi has started another game of poker.
As Egypt remains the most divided in its history over the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else&#39;s opinion, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been amended many times, weakening the country&#39;s constitutional stability and leading to legal disputes.
This new initiative only further strengthened the country&#39;s divisiveness.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president persists in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continues to &quot;break his word&quot; and &quot;tramp on the law&quot;.
However, his supporters assure that it is a means to turn around the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of clarifying the text to the Egyptians article by article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy as protests sweep the country.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially since this hastily organized vote presents the Egyptian people with an ultimatum: &quot;Either approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers&quot;, which should otherwise end after the new constitution is approved.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 deputies of the mentioned constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the promulgation of the constitution, they slammed the door saying that they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 substitutes were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that the articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further noted that one of the few controversies that day revolved around... the clock for prayer, when some committee members opined that the meeting room clocks were not adjusted properly.
The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains the same as the 1971 version of the constitution and states that &quot;the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law&quot;.
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental demands, hoped to replace the term &quot;principles&quot; with the term &quot;rules&quot;, which would allow stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect towards other parts of Egyptian society.
&quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; object the liberals, who see in it only a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar University with an advisory role, especially for issues of checking the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because &quot;the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see in it the beginnings of a theocracy&quot;.
The fact that the next chancellor of the university should be less moderate than the current one is fueling the liberals&#39; fears even more.
&quot;So far, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a largely civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of them studied in French schools,&quot; mitigates the concerns of Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that &quot;there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious vocabulary.
There is a particular reference to &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence, note ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to what extent civil judges are competent to comment on this&quot;.
In addition to the religious aspects, the text approved yesterday is highly criticized because of the expanded powers it grants to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that they have been significantly curtailed compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the army representatives, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the Parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, trials involving civilians will not be prohibited in military courts, as requested by associations for the protection of human rights.
These associations talk about their doubts regarding the text, which they say is directed against freedom.
The criminal offense of blasphemy is retained and insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayefová from the Human Rights Watch organization.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture mentioned in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will demonstrate on Saturday.
Holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of saturated salt solution await Ukrainian tourists in Israel
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AaF has identified the top five reasons why you should visit Israel.
Pay homage to holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God&#39;s mercy will descend upon all who enter this &quot;spa&quot;.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus&#39; miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
This is also where Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Here, believers will walk the Way of Pain, or Jesus&#39; Way of the Cross (Via Dolorosa in Latin).
It starts at the Fort Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial was held, passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, grew the tree from which they made the cross for Jesus&#39; crucifixion.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remnant of the Temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes here, which are then filled out.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada fortress remain from the secret shelter from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who engage in mountain climbing can reach it by their own efforts.
The others will be taken to this historic mountain by cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus transports tourists to this ski paradise from the bottom of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
You cannot visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the ancient Qumran manuscripts, or the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Art Museum in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
Impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented in his exhibition.
In Acre, you can visit the Al Basha Spa Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of an ancient Turkish bath with mannequins of spa users and spa attendants from that time.
In Caesarea, the unique private Ralli museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the sculptures of Dalí and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or gift shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children&#39;s Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You step inside - and find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are twinkling.
And there are the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
The three main spa centers of Israel are located on the coast of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead seas.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, because the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people swim in it all year round.
By the way, the Dead Sea is the most special sea in the world, it is located at the lowest land point on the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps even non-swimmers afloat.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Head here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and medicinal mud that can treat health problems such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to heal your frayed nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
A famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love wandering through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press yourself against the walls in the alley of &quot;your&quot; sign, luck will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries to have their photos taken.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and &quot;conquer&quot; the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for a word
If you are going to Israel, you don&#39;t need to worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population in this country speak Russian.
On the trip, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and the city of Haifa has the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
Basically, it is an underground cable car.
Traveling by all types of city public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel for 1.5 hours with transfers.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop working.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus porridge, various types of sauces, ground chickpea balls - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many fattened cats that gracefully &quot;wander around according to their taste&quot;.
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Purring cats love crowded places and will gobble up every treat with gusto.
Renting a car will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the car brand.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels per day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to get to know the country and rest.
118.8 thousand people visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012. of Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
The &quot;Great and Powerful&quot; will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on the language
While parliamentarians and human rights defenders are still debating the law on mandatory language tests, fraudsters selling &quot;fake&quot; certificates have already appeared in the country
13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support their families back home.
On December 1, a law entered into force according to which every working migrant will be required to pass a test on the knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing and community management, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Even people who successfully managed to achieve certification and obtain an academic diploma before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to this law.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of examination sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; already today more than 160 such centers are opened in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law entered into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question many times in the press: what will it actually bring?
What will the obligation to know the language change for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service answer - it will make it possible to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of &quot;slave labor.&quot;
Today, many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should begin even before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will make it possible to solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowing the language - Sebelev says with conviction - the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a &quot;voucher&quot; to terrible, cramped hostels, in which he and dozens of others like himself will languish for months without food or documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
&quot;They promise them one thing in their homeland, but upon arrival they cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages,&quot; confirms Tolib Šaripov, head of the Main Tajik Labor Migration Administration of the MS.
Don&#39;t curse!
Even less, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to enter, but they do not even have experience in the work in question.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as it is a misfortune: very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly clothed, shod and equipped for school.
As children reach working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language it is difficult - they admit.
&quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot;
It is true that with regard to the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be done for those migrants who have legal status.
If they don&#39;t have it, they won&#39;t pass exams or get any other official job.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
&quot;Welcome, or Uninvited Entry Prohibited&quot;
Many of the incoming workers claim that it is not easy to get official status in our country.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and from this there are cases of extortion.
&quot;They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,&quot; - Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov shared his experience with journalists.
&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be stingy, buy a painting&quot;
On the first day of the language law&#39;s validity, it was discovered that not only migrants&#39; registration documents are fake.
FMS employees have already seized several fake certificates of completion of the language test.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the problem of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more than taking the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, both government officials and human rights defenders agree on this.
For now, government authorities can promise foreign workers who fail the tests the necessary time to complete a course in the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas that do not require active interaction with people.
The MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not allow the illegal arms market to circulate
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of Interior of Russia presents a proposal to tighten the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: spurred by shootings at weddings, which ended without victims, and a massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people died.
The police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the State Duma&#39;s Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who has promised that changes to the arms law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem in a &quot;tightening of the screws&quot; way.
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the &quot;pointless tightening&quot; of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist in an interview with the Russian editorial staff of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of legal regulations in the field of civilian weapons will not force criminals to switch to the &quot;black&quot; market.
According to them, you can currently find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The &quot;black&quot; arms market is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept orders for weapons
The first of them - &quot;army or military road&quot;, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
&quot;Russian officers and Caucasians themselves stole weapons,&quot; says Baraněc.
Another type of &quot;black weapons&quot; are weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses as well as weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal &quot;barrels&quot; are sold from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military warehouses.
&quot;It is proven that some of the fires were set deliberately - to cover up the shortage,&quot; says the former soldier.
According to Barance, weapons manufacturers also contribute.
&quot;Currently, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive on the international market, and they are scrapping weapons that they supply to the black market, including to Moscow,&quot; says this expert.
Another source of the &quot;black&quot; market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and assault rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
&quot;There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in small quantities, and a mafia was formed that organized their smooth production,&quot; explains the former soldier.
Where is the gun from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of individual sources of illegal weapons supplies to the &quot;black&quot; market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Analysis of Problems and Projecting of Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from the military and executive agencies.
Half of all weapons ended up on the black market &quot;because of officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; the report said.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases weapons were stolen during their production, 5% is &quot;black archaeology&quot;.
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons shops, who asked not to be named, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black &quot;archaeologists&quot; have long since been bought by no one - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, sellers go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through the ensign, the interested party buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you over the fence.
&quot;He takes it to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,&quot; he says.
&quot;The truth is that the police are well informed, and that&#39;s why whenever their plan to solve crimes starts to burn, they will make a control purchase from dealers with illegal weapons,&quot; adds the adviser.
&quot;Like in a luxury store&quot;
Sellers and buyers most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy appeared who offered me the opportunity to go to the &quot;Trial&quot; platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to a &quot;corner&quot; where we would deal together.
I only found out about the price there
Military reporter Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a weapon, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, says the salesman - adviser. - I have such an acquaintance, but I do not fully trust him.
There are sellers in the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically &quot;from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to take care that the daughter&#39;s tooth fell out.&quot;
And now I&#39;ll get there through a person I&#39;m sure of.
He will also supply them only to me, because he knows that I will not betray him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article for a publication on this topic.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
They gave him a photo album with &quot;everything you could think of&quot;.
&quot;I felt like I was in a luxury store,&quot; recalls the soldier.
According to Baraněc, the buyer is not offered a rabbit in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, simply do not buy - we go to the forest with the seller and set a target.
&quot;They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we start to act,&quot; the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on sofa
Search engines on the Internet will lead you to websites and groups on &quot;Vkontakt&quot;, where weapons are offered for purchase &quot;for various purposes&quot;.
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required for this.
&quot;It is enough to have a certain amount of money,&quot; they write in the advertising headline on the website &quot;Buy a combat pistol or a machine gun&quot;.
On these pages, users leave their announcements and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
&quot;Without a license, of course,&quot; asks user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling preserved).
&quot;I will buy TT.Moscow&quot; - succinctly formulates the demand of &quot;Fedorenkov.&quot;
The Federal Security Service has recently cracked down on a vast network of bogus websites and can scoop up those looking to buy a military weapon.
People flock like hungry fish to the bait and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military official Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
&quot;In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden,&quot; says Dmitri Kislov, a press spokesman for the &quot;Right to a Gun&quot; NGO.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can be left without a weapon and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has recently cracked down on a vast network of bogus websites and can scoop up those looking to buy a military weapon.
&quot;People flock like hungry fish to the bait and then mine coal in Siberia,&quot; he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will usually pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the non-governmental organization &quot;The Right to Arms&quot;, you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon is shipped from the warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle link.
According to the official statistics office, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% in total, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of solved cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at the cash register of &quot;McDonald&quot; establishments
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot;, &quot;Burger King&quot;, &quot;Taco Bell&quot;, &quot;Wendy&#39;s&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Fried Chicken&quot;.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or whether it is destined to die out soon.
This whole action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the meager wages that rank-and-file workers receive at Walmart and fast-food chains, the goal of the protest organizers is to get them to form their own unions.
Currently, this economic sector is practically untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The actions began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, engulfing millions of residents and in some cases being accompanied by fights.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, walked off the job and demonstrated with unions and left-wing activists of multinational chain companies whose goods are aimed at lower and middle class people.
Worldwide, Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That&#39;s why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheap in part because it pays its workers so little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or manual scanners.
The &quot;Black Friday&quot; protesters demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of company-provided health insurance had skyrocketed from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker is paid $9.50 an hour, but that doesn&#39;t match the cost, employees say.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart shifts the wage increase entirely onto the shoulders of consumers, each store visit will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend approximately $12.39 more than today.
Walmart&#39;s defenders point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should cause virtually no damage to the company.
&quot;Black Friday&quot; at the company&#39;s stores ran from 8 p.m. Thursday night until midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on &quot;Black Friday&quot;.
Company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning website Huffington Post that &quot;fewer than five&quot; Walmart workers walked off the job in total, and that the protest was, after all, &quot;another media stunt&quot; orchestrated by the union.
&quot;Vacant checkout!&quot;
Protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart (they are not very popular in the said progressive city and therefore are almost absent), but &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald&#39;s says they sell billions of servings and then they don&#39;t even pay you sick leave or pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Councilman
Currently, the federal and New York state minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually raising that wage, but only slightly, and on average, their rank-and-file workers in New York are paid $8.90 an hour.
No one is underpaid in this expensive city.
I don&#39;t quite understand how you can exist in New York on that kind of money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the counter after school part-time and live with their parents go through McDonald&#39;s employment.
Few see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for long.
Currently, I constantly meet in conversation with &quot;McDonald&quot; workers who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children with it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum where the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&#39;t know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at the McDonald&#39;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at the fast-food chain be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage. wages.
They also demanded that unions be established in the fast food industry.
US law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of unions and punishing union activists with harassment and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food companies for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
Loud protests were also held at a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants that day.
The event culminated in a midday rally at a McDonald&#39;s near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, notably City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&#39;s says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn&#39;t even pay you sick leave and it doesn&#39;t pay you properly for your honest work!&quot;
The protesters also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must stand together in support of fast food workers so that they can achieve fair pay for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves! &quot;
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended, although not all of them were fast-food workers, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement is still unclear.
&quot;So far, the brain manages to deceive averagely&quot;
Augmented reality is a popular topic among fans of modern virtual reality technologies; lately it means perceiving the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a working model of this innovation, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed an application for a corresponding patent.
From an interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft&#39;s Cambridge laboratory, Šaram Izadi, it follows that for scientists of this company, glasses are already a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us roughly what your research group does?
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and today almost no Xbox is on sale without Kinect sensors, because the possibility of controlling with gestures is very interesting for everyone.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although the Kinect system has brought interaction to a physical level, a great many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow has not yet improved.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
This is a popular thing, but isn&#39;t it overrated?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not sweeping ones, just such stingy, short ones.
At the same time, gestures would not be captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
It&#39;s big so far, but in theory it can be shrunk down to the size of a wristwatch.
However, in general, the future has a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- And how?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make the user adapt to what the machine can or can&#39;t do at that moment?
- This is not necessary at all, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can detect human reactions more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - that&#39;s what we can bounce off of in our 3D recognition work.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it&#39;s not just about the megapixels themselves, but like the matrix and depth.
Looking at it now, all the current technologies are insufficient for us - this gives the algorithm designers work.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So the speed, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movement is quite dynamic and current 30 frames per second streams are frankly a bit low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100ms, while current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the latter value (60-100ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don&#39;t need so many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - it&#39;s actually a regular visible range sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of performed calculations.
It would be nice to make a flexible analog Kinect system, play around with the curvature of the camera placement and see how that helps with 3D positioning.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don&#39;t you think that this is one of the most promising platforms when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding a smartphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a &quot;portable&quot; form of augmented reality, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to a smartphone, projection display and more at any time based on the cloud platform all the way round.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (only you can see private things), and at the same time also a weakness - augmented reality based on glasses does not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also to an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don&#39;t feel anything!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is being used - using the second hand as a kind of background for imaging.
It records compressions in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding tactility to these &quot;images in the air&quot; - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located creates a tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - like blowing on a the bellies of the fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you ever tried to trick your brain?
For him to think he feels what he seems to feel at that moment when he sees something?
- That&#39;s a good idea, we haven&#39;t tried that yet.
Here comes another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very confined space believe that he is walking in an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all, like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If tricking the brain becomes the goal, then the work is still many years away.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot;Rosbalt&quot; is a continuation of the &quot;St. Petersburg Avant-garde&quot; project, dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the framework of the city, often finding recognition in Europe without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and at openings.
Cyril Miller&#39;s paintings always attract crowds wherever they are exhibited.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets brings a smile to the face of the citizens, raising everyone&#39;s spirits.
He recently took up the bottler and became a St. Petersburg bottler, because he matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around town all in red and not yellow or, for example, turquoise?
- I chose the color red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the color red represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the public.
Although it is generally true that anything that is slightly different from gray arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The entire history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture on Něvské, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my path is.
Then the wave of the old free unofficial artists passed and I couldn&#39;t understand the new, free types of artists.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonev artists who brought us to the &quot;Pushkinská 10&quot;, and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to the theater, dressing up, music, all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your art-clinic ...- It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg culture, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a place at Pushkinská 10, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg&#39;s bohemia, even before the reconstruction.
Many things were born there: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don&#39;t forget how Šnur was brought in with the &quot;Van Gogh&#39;s Ear&quot; project.
Šnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight leotards, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trachtenberg led many programs of Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, that&#39;s how his great career began, he got his basic education and professional training from us.
Gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, club &quot;Gribojedov - this is the echo of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests left.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press, the special prize was &quot;People in our town&quot;.
I was named in the &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; nomination, that was the end of my peak.
In new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In today&#39;s age it is easy to become popular but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular but not very cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits, in which actuality and insight are vividly captured.
I will have a program exhibition &quot;Russian Museum in Clowns&quot;.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, now being so is painful and horrible.
But in clowns, everything is erased, the tragedy is erased.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by means of a totalitarian disguise in an orderly order.
Today, people meet by their clothes, they are oriented towards the outer mechanics, not the inner person.
Or maybe you can&#39;t shake his hand and need to spit in his face.
And delusion will be removed by changing clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of a town bottler. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial, applied art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people gathered in groups, the bohemian loved one, simple people the other.
Today, everything is broken in micro-society, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I&#39;m not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Stas Michajlova!
- Female fans will come to him, the sexual social sphere is involved there.
And 300 people come to the cultural ground and 10 thousand don&#39;t come, and the result is less management, less money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and does not violate what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted such pictures, which hung on the wall of a collector together with Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse terms.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that&#39;s from somewhere else.
I am a man of yesterday&#39;s culture, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money to paint pictures.
And I am for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is lacking in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an activist through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
During the time of the proper tsars, it was not like that in everything, the tsars may not have understood the culture very well, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked away somewhere in a corner, because great experts are needed who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, taste thrives.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that we do not accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petersburg is?
- Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is the right soil.
And in our wasteland, art is doing poorly.
We need cultural ground, but today there are more writers than readers here, that&#39;s wrong.
In Europe, there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St.Petersburg grant
Giving birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board set off in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to maintain their race in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don&#39;t think the selection is very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, if only hypothetically.
&quot;It&#39;s Venus and Mars,&quot; says Vladimir Surdin, a high-ranking scientist at the State Astronomical Institute PK Šternberg (SAIŠ).
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live there at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists started solving the issues of reproduction in space with flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then an insect was carried into orbit - very small Drosophila fruit flies.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to test how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
&quot;The problem arises with the fact that this bird has to find a foothold, stand on its own two feet and start moving,&quot; says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and do somersaults.
After 10 hours, there was a complete loss of instincts in the newly hatched birds.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the problem was that within four days they simply perished.
&quot;We let the birds hatch twice, but then we refused because it is simply impossible to work with them there,&quot; comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last &quot;miniarch&quot; with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But there will only be beings of one gender in the biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot;.
An experiment was conducted with rats that were sent into space already pregnant.
Basically, they didn&#39;t discover anything supernatural there.
&quot;It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment, and such experiments should be carried out,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on earth, the space rats gave birth to offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It&#39;s a tough task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instinct when they lose their usual environment.
Humans, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova was in the greatest danger.
The most precious thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive the flight into space.
Whether she can give birth to a child after such a flight.
&quot;After all, no one has answered this question yet,&quot; says Vakhtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Těrešková, gave birth to a daughter.
The child&#39;s father was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolaev.
In 1988, a son was born to the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savická, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have had healthy offspring after many years.
&quot;Moreover, it can be dangerous even during orbital flights,&quot; says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero-gravity conditions, cosmonauts learn the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although for adults water is a comfortable but in a way strange environment, for small children it is a natural element.
The tiny ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is in the mother&#39;s amniotic fluid for an average of 9 months and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
&quot;That&#39;s very little for a child to forget,&quot; says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn baby, then the inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is more natural for women.
Abdominal muscles and pelvic muscles atrophy very quickly in a state of weightlessness, the body&#39;s ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can leave that aside if the muscle activity stimulators work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother&#39;s organism expels the fetus.
&quot;What next?&quot; Valery Polyakov asks difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the earth&#39;s attraction does not act on the organism, it will not be able to properly form the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed like an adult in a special weighted suit to train in.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
&quot;If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment,&quot; predicts Igor Pestov, head of the commission for bioethics of the IBMP RAN.
So the birth of children in space is only a theoretical question today.
One day, however, the time will come when it will become a reality and Earthlings will set off in their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their space-born offspring.
The head of the SAO: The control of the black system failed because of the politicians
The Czech Republic has good inspectors and high-quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but it falters in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala says so.
&quot;The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that&#39;s what I think we lack,&quot; Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also indicated by the joint inspection of the Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of incorrect practice, he cites Petr Nečas&#39;s approach to the so-called &quot;black system&quot;.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its checks - is it banned or allowed?
&quot;The law must be set somehow, and if it prohibits something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to check and enforce obligations,&quot; states Kala.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the legislation related to public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel inspection that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, the point is that European legislation regulates how public contracts should be handled, followed by individual national legislations and then also by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and even though the inspection is not yet finished, very interesting differences have become apparent to us - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps &quot;stricter and more perfect&quot; in our country, however, the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually help you with, what will come of it for you?
It is this kind of joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to make the laws more precise, reduce and improve the limits, when it does not have such a positive effect.
Economy means obtaining the appropriate item at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, in order to exclude enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by lowering the order limit, we don&#39;t necessarily achieve that.
Perhaps the system will be overwhelmed with so much &quot;paper&quot; that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw from it much more easily than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the inspection system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there like the SAO, which is organized similarly to us, it also has a collegium, only it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, it also has these accounting courts at the level of the individual federal states - that&#39;s where the system differs from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, in our case represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by regions and municipalities in our country, are checked there at the level of federal accounting courts.
As for the legislation there, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
So is it because they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but I say again, I don&#39;t like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider to be role models are facing a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our office, right?
With regard to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are its effects already being felt somehow?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in our control actions.
Since we do ex post checks, a certain delay must be expected.
We observe this so far only in the process of preparing future controls - we launched our new tool &quot;detection of risks of wastefulness&quot;, through which we ran through almost 14 thousand public contracts, and analyzed them - there, of course, the changes will be reflected, because the limits, conditions will change some types of selection procedure will be modified and so on.
So do you consider the approval of this law to be more of a benefit, or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise here is that the rules will become &quot;tighter&quot; and it will not be possible to follow them.
Already under the operation of the previous rules, controlled persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programs by the regional council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it worth tightening the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to challenge and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how to get out of it?
Let&#39;s show where the road does not lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called &quot;blackmail system&quot; - and what does that mean?
Is the black system disabled or enabled?
After all, the law must be set somehow, and if it prohibits something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activity of the office, which has the duty to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, &quot;We&#39;re going to change the law and allow it,&quot; but he can&#39;t say we&#39;re going to act like nothing happened.
There are fairly strict rules in the Public Procurement Act as to what is to be formally done - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the applicant with the best offer is excluded only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that&#39;s what I think we lack.
The roads are icy in places, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are icy and also covered in snow.
However, the roads are mostly passable, sometimes with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region this morning, the roads were passable, but in some places icy and snowy.
The temperature dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero, but it should warm up slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and only a thin layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
Visibility was also lower in places due to the fog, according to the data of the regional road traffic control.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads are now freely accessible in the region.
However, caution is in order, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be icy and slippery.
All roads of the second and third class, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some sections, there are still remnants of frozen and drifted snow on them.
Above all, in higher positions, you need to pay extra attention to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
There is a risk of frost on some roads in eastern Bohemia, and there may be a layer of snow on the roads at higher altitudes and in the mountains, the Directorate of Roads and Highways informs on its website.
Road officials are warning drivers about icing, which can form especially in the higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can be found in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýt, especially on second- and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav are chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads in the Krkonoše and Orlické mountains.
The snow cover is at its highest on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly clear to partly clear without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, there is a light wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, but in some places with increased caution and driving needs to be adapted to the weather.
It is freezing in the morning, with temperatures between three and nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some roads may be icy.
In places, drivers must also expect fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This follows from the information of the dispatch of regional road workers.
The D5 highway is passable almost without restrictions, however, road administrators recommend extra caution between kilometers 80 and 131.
Most of the first class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, there may be icy sections in southern Pilsen and Tachov.
The second and third class roads are wet, and also in this case the warning for icy sections applies.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the highest points of the Olomouc region have to reckon with slush on the road today.
After the chemical spraying, it remained on the Červenohorské saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Snowfall drove the road workers out into the terrain at night, according to the road managers, about three centimeters of snow fell in Šumperska.
In other parts of the region, roads are mostly passable without restrictions.
&quot;There are remnants of snow at the highest points in Šumpersk.
&quot;Drivers must expect snow slurry on the Červenohorské sedlo in the direction of Jeseník,&quot; a dispatcher from the Šumper road administration told ČTK today.
Their colleagues in Jesenice also went out into the terrain at night, according to them, the paths up to and to the highest places are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are passable without restrictions, but in Šternbersk, drivers should be careful in the forest sections, where the roads have remained wet.
Ústí Region, Liberecký Region
This morning, road workers in the north of the Czech Republic are reporting several difficult-to-drive places.
In addition to several places with falling snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústeck is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures stay below zero even in lower locations, so ice and snow will probably last on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, on the other hand, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of ice is reported by road workers especially from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and frost at night.
Unfavorable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by the bent branches of the trees, which bent under the snow all the way to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at the concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It&#39;s just one of the other alarmist messages we humans like to fall for.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we rather joke about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can muster enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also organize a completely unique project, three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 am.
The day before, December 20, from 9 p.m., 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we came up with everything together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original keys to the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The group The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called &quot;End of the World Canceled&quot;.
She is already very popular on YouTube today, will she also perform at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, that is, if we succeed in everything and the end of the world does not happen...
It is sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
The anthems will also be linked together in a unique live broadcast on Czech television.
He wrote the words to this song and Tomáš Hanák plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you come to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We try to intensively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world go to?
For the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been realizing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap at the Jedliček Institute.
Lecturers regularly visit the students of the Jedlička Institute schools and engage them in activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves don&#39;t have the means to hire tutors on their own, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar &quot;bombastic events&quot; in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests here as well.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and personally, when we are in the USA, I would like to connect it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of disabled people.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It is not as terrible as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric cart, their carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we haul a lot of cargo and tool boxes...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were excellently prepared for us, that I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how each country differs in accessibility, public access to the disabled, and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than here, it was in Russia that we witnessed that everything is still in its infancy in the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person to move alone in the city center on an electric wheelchair.
Even the obvious things, such as giving priority to wheelchair users in the elevator, do not apply there.
Fortunately, civic associations are already being formed there as well, which try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still behind on...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is completely normal that even people with a severe handicap can move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life there, on the contrary, we and The Tap Tap are a little ahead!
Respecting the public or accessibility is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things really start to change.
So far, these are rare cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let&#39;s go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlička Institute as an educator, where I was surrounded by many young people who were interested in doing something.
And since I&#39;m a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so I founded a hobby music club together with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity came only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It&#39;s true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the band.
We realized that work that cannot be seen is essentially as if it did not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to take The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I daresay Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is of course regret, that&#39;s natural...
But that pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering all abandoned beings that we have to pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, provided of course that they have the necessary means to do so.
I say that when people with disabilities succeed in something, it is not only a shift for them, but for the whole society.
Has being a strict boss, as many people have described you, also contributed to this success?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that&#39;s completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and with their head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend rehearsals and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there when it started in 1998?
Only one Laďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, you can&#39;t help it.
Anyone who has the will and desire always has an open door with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynoje with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by a telebridge during the joint singing of the song &quot;The End of the World Canceled&quot; by the band The Tap Tap
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedliček Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
The entrance fee for the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 are admitted for free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on November 12, 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of the agency&#39;s projects.
However, Poland&#39;s journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already involved in spaceflight before the Second World War; but they were not always met with understanding.
I will remind you, for example, of A. Šternfeld&#39;s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, who on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Introduction to Cosmonautics.
The thoughts of the young engineer (b. 1905) left listeners cold, and years later Šternfeld recalled that only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his Entry into Cosmonautics in France.
The aforementioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of space travel, and his contribution was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway sink was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are not known either.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to start the dredsin or to brake it.
Information about this dressing is known only from the contemporary press.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to deal with rocket missiles.
The research was carried out by the Chamber of Arms Technicians in cooperation with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and prof. by Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, the research was interrupted by the arrival of German troops.
In 1937, a proposal for a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year, the work Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakitebomba lotnicza by Leliwa-Krzywoblocký was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was devoted to all projects of military use of rocket technology, which coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities were terminated by the start of the war.
Other works devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The company is first mentioned in the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problems, in which there are four more extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the fall, the PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the RM-2 two-stage rocket began in the Bledovská Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next development type was already supposed to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor high-altitude winds.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 became the successor of the first RM-type rockets.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
A space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters was available in the rocket Meteor-1A.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, development of the Meteor-2 rocket took place at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of around 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were subsequently built.
Poland&#39;s entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later should also be mentioned.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of more, unregulated economic competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic entities, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of significant differences in the price of labor (wages), there is a price tension.
By this term, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer tries to survive the economic competition by importing cheap goods by &quot;undercutting&quot; the competitor&#39;s price in order to capture a larger share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or to buy there cheaply, or to disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus responsibility for the unemployment produced by it, the social expenditures of the state necessarily increase.
The whole situation is exacerbated by the complete reluctance of the businessmen to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
The reckless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population to private capital regardless of social decline.
This is manifested primarily in changes to applicable laws.
The goal is to economically force the own population to accept the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This happens on the one hand through a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand by limiting the rights of employees in the area of labor law.
The result is growing poverty along with a widening gap between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, there have been public food pantries for many years for the poor who cannot support themselves through their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for cases where properly employed people receive such a wage that the state has to pay them up to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures of practically all southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation, when people are forced to either emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or live on starvation wages at the fringes of society, under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in the social level, in the hope that one day private investment capital will come.
But here it is necessary to ask where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, or a Turk, a Moroccan, or an Egyptian, or an African still work for a fraction of a European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim ad nauseum that the state cannot capitalize on its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital fiercely insists on the position that the state must not intervene in the economy through management interventions.
Then one must ask whether private capital does not influence, and now actually controls, politics and thus the entire state in its own egoistic sense.
The answer here is a definite yes.
The proof is the existence of a practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the field of corruption, giving mutual benefits, legislation where practically everything is punishable, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries, due to a lack of funds, outsource the drafting of draft laws to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
In this way, all power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions proclaim, but from financially powerful groups preferring their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation as described by Appianus in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: &quot;The state had long been in complete disintegration and the authorities were filled by force.
By bribes, illegal favors, and by means of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption ran rampant without any inhibitions and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote&quot; ...&quot;characteristic people did not run for office at all, so once as a result of this disruption the state was without consuls for eight months&quot;.. ..&quot;It began indeed to speak of the fact that autocracy is the only remedy in a bad situation and that an energetic man must be chosen..&quot; Appianus did think of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who changed permanent democracy to autocracy.
Conclusion As in ancient times, today&#39;s society is based on a reckless preference for one&#39;s own benefit, regardless of the interest of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is no longer capable of understanding and applying the benefit of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elites without any attempt at reforms of a deeper nature.
We must therefore look for the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As it stands, the demise of these systems in favor of a liberal-type democracy can be seen as a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
What is particularly catastrophic is the fact that the current elites completely ignore the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social catastrophes we are already witnessing along with the crimes against humanity as we know them from old and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of economic competition both at the international and intra-European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
&quot;Nothing comes from violence and never can&quot; Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is &quot;let&#39;s not forget how fragile we are&quot;
&quot;If my sons did not want wars, there would be none&quot; dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a lot of reaction.
Some stand behind Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and the Palestinians fit the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel fit the role of a terrorist state.
I don&#39;t want to think about who is the culprit and who is the victim in the periodically recurring waves of killing, after all, today&#39;s residents of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who primarily serves the tension that has lasted for 95 years (calculated since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts, some are derived from them based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who completely autonomously directed their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world&#39;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have happened in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out who could be considered the head of the octopus (I don&#39;t know if anyone still stands above them, but I don&#39;t rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) back in the 1890s to stop their name being associated with the highly criminal acts behind which they stood and which for them always meant consolidating power, increasing wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where they do not have stakes in the central bank they are fighting or preparing wars (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only four remained, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore Rothschild&#39;s Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (meaning government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Rep. Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression of 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree of initiation, Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of eliminating large monarchist state units in Europe, the second was supposed to eliminate the colonial dominions of Great Britain in particular, and the third should lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such an amount of slaves is enough for their comfort and luxury and they do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a prelude to such a solution) and the ultimate assumption of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises like the one they caused in 1907 would not be repeated).
So after they succeeded in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the RU throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Czarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for a war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating the premise of the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was push the Germans a leader who was strong enough, who pointed out the culprits and offered simple solutions, and so on by the creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and did play, the function of the fifth column in igniting the conflagration of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (a return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler broke free from the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or everything he did was planned is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany&#39;s war reparations caused World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focus of the third war.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, like in the latter, will be victims in the front line of the fighting, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (just consider how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where grievance begets grievance in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power stood at the beginning of everything?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, like here, the international bankers push the people to choose only their own candidates in the elections.
The current prime minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, politician who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran&#39;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan. ..), threatened to turn into a global conflict and, given Iran&#39;s control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all the world&#39;s oil travels (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 now appear: &quot;All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.&quot;
The new world order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at birth with a chip that turns them into a totally controlled being.
&quot;And he compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that he may not buy or sell who is not marked with the name of the beast or with the number of his name.
This must be understood: let him who has sense count the numbers of the beast.
That number denotes a man, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six.&quot;
Movie Argo: Calling Hollywood when it&#39;s worst
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students overran the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were supposed to be released in exchange for the deposed shah Mohamed Réza Pahlavi, who fled to the USA after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as it would fundamentally jeopardize the trust of allies in other countries.
But she was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter&#39;s loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The movie Argo, directed by actor Ben Affleck, describes one episode of that history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy, six employees fled.
After complicated vicissitudes, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of a film crew that was inspecting locations in the country for the filming of a sci-fi blockbuster.
A combination of genres
The plan, devised by &quot;exfiltration&quot; expert Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend believable, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck&#39;s film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time a so-called &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of a successful stunt, a failure - an example can be the series of Danny&#39;s partners.
The film thus alternates moods - on the one hand, the documentary sequences from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic period photographs of the events are shown as well as the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, light-hearted passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the meeting tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to reboot his career in a remarkable way.
From a mocked actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime thriller Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The City (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck&#39;s first film that does not take place in the director&#39;s home Boston.
At the same time, the feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that raised the director&#39;s older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;played&quot; by Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, while reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere out of the blue.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake crew in a Tehran bazaar).
Too many plots in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not really offer much in the cinematic sense of exciting scenes.
He almost works with it quite successfully, sometimes he comes up with something to match reality - things don&#39;t work out so elegantly there anymore (the scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America and the chase down the runway seems rather far-fetched).
But Argo&#39;s weakness is the distraction resulting from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck&#39;s film loses a bit of its dramatic thrust, it is a film that can be watched with mild interest, to appreciate the execution and the retro style evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
But it&#39;s hard to pull off.
As a reminder of a still-in-a-way living history and a proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, it will suffice.
Rules for blowing up balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a poll for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for &quot;the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop&quot;.
&quot;We were led to this by the latest event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies,&quot; survey organizer Patrik Nacher told Práv.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court on the unification of insurance premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women have been favored in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
&quot;People can nominate other incredible ideas from the EU workshop until the end of this year.
The voting itself will then take place until the end of February 2013,&quot; informed Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the compulsory mixing of bio-components into fuel, which as a result harms nature, the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of hen cages, which made eggs significantly more expensive this year .
The de facto ban on the use of the term spread butter or the removal of classic light bulbs from sale also faced criticism earlier.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of one or another business or industrial lobby, whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic is now enforcing the demands of its banks even with the threat of a veto).
The interests of the lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show &quot;anomalous curvature&quot;.
At the same time, the European Commission defended itself by only harmonizing the existing inconsistent national standards, which complicated trading.
The EU has already softened the standards regarding fruit and vegetables, despite the opposition of some states, pointing out that the existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year&#39;s EU regulation may also be a candidate for victory in the poll, according to which inflatable balloons sold must have a warning that children under 8 years of age must not blow them up without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to American research, according to which balloons among toys are the leading cause of death for children from suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under the age of 14 when blowing fairground puffs.
Curious ideas are also born at home
The rule regarding the European officials themselves is also rather absurd - everyone who has an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia due to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated for the poll, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, for example, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU established the maximum volumes of food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies upon application for a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
&quot;We are handicapped by not having the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund,&quot; declared the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was harvested in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the fact that the Czech Republic is closer to the ports.
In the end, the European Commission came to the aid of the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Municipalities were offered a subsidy to obtain a subsidy by the Ministry for Regional Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically they were supposed to write a subsidy application from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although the regulations easily become a target of criticism in the member states, the EU&#39;s efforts at regulation and at the same time more efficient functioning and development of the entire Union deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
According to experts, a more serious problem is, for example, the use of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced by the member states during budget negotiations.
The fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to a specific label for its traditional products also arouses emotion among the Czechs, and it does not always succeed in this struggle.
After a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs won the name Olomouc tvarůžk, but our producers had to rename the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, to dozemák.
Only products made from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet, can bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck in Germany and Parma ham, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, Pohořeličky and Třeboň carp and Žatec hops have already found themselves.
Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice tubes can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to save the republic, but I&#39;m an amateur, Okamura claims
Senator, how does one get the idea of running for president?
I&#39;m not about being a senator or president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I wouldn&#39;t run for office anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how the country is being robbed for the last twenty years, how thieves are running around, people&#39;s taxes and retirement age are being increased.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don&#39;t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I&#39;m already in my forties and an independent non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you soon left for the Castle.
Are you not turning your back on the people who elected you?
I said all along that I would go into the fight for the Castle depending on the result of the senate elections.
I later clarified that if I am elected senator, I will run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool to realize my visions.
That&#39;s why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the problem is not only that as a nation we curse in the pub and on TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Added to this is the media, which defames a person and confuses freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I was bribing journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let&#39;s get to your visions.
You started the fight for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retrospective asset declarations of over twenty million.
You need to change the law for that.
But as president, you don&#39;t have that kind of authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
When I lobbied as a citizen for guiding to be a free trade, it succeeded.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, it is deliberately rejected, and that delays the citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without partisan pigeonholing and dogma, I can take what is best for our country from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It doesn&#39;t matter to me if it&#39;s a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me it is important that we move forward.
It&#39;s not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by KSČM or ODS, and I will be against a bad idea anyway.
You&#39;re kidding yourself when someone says you&#39;re a populist.
But don&#39;t you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, all you&#39;re left with are slogans.
And you can&#39;t get by with that in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to push it through.
If I were elected president, it is not a problem to organize a live television broadcast where I will ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to tell why they don&#39;t want her.
When there is a strong personality who will name the wrongdoings, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, that was due to public pressure.
To be honest, I say that I am an amateur, that I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just started in politics and I will try to get majority support for my program.
I&#39;m trying to move things on my own, if it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I&#39;m no savior.
I know that I can&#39;t do anything in one person, that&#39;s why I went around a number of well-known people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, he refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud with light heating oils.
I ran with people being really unhappy, but now I&#39;m on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who did, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate in such a way that it will be difficult to enforce changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Thinking of starting your own party?
I haven&#39;t considered this yet because I don&#39;t have the time or money to do background checks on every potential matchmaker.
I don&#39;t even have money for the presidential campaign, there is only 20 thousand in my transparent account.
Don&#39;t have money?
You talk about asset declarations, what is yours?
I estimate private assets at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, an art collection for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in a car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil and evil.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have assets worth 60 million and no money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don&#39;t want to put much of your own money into it.
That&#39;s not very convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for a campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors indicates that there is probably not that much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign out of my own money.
The cost of the campaign will basically be covered by what I will receive as a senator.
But I wouldn&#39;t be able to make a living from it, for example, I wouldn&#39;t be able to pay for my son&#39;s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn&#39;t run for office.
So you&#39;re going to keep doing business for a living?
Didn&#39;t you say you were going to tone down these activities?
But it is not related to the amount of salary.
As I promised, I have partially muted my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the travel agent in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need something to live on.
How much were you used to taking monthly as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take further.
And if I were president, I would shut down my business.
You can find the entire interview in the Saturday edition of Prava.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don&#39;t just happen in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
&quot;The building looks cheerful to me, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again,&quot; says Lisette Verhaig, who is walking around on the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company nearby, opines: &quot;Sure, the house is nice.&quot;
However, I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPads and e-books.
Nobody voluntarily goes to any of these old-style libraries these days, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate very close to Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own and not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To solve this stupid situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of the fictitious bridges that are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councilors realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture studio MVRDV, a master of insanely bold bar graphs and builder of humorous, often even cynical structures, took the matter with his usual calmness and appeared at the competition meeting in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around in amazement and shrugging its shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled his gifts on top of each other according to size and ended his activist-reasoned speech with the words &quot;Dear city council!&quot;
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was topped for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town greyness, which until now could not offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an extraordinarily ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is thanks to this a little bit more contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: reader eldorado under the cheese hatch.
There is an elevator through the massif of the mountain, but you will discover the true spatial and reading passions only when you conquer the topography on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear from all sides, the floor made of burnt wood and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog, and boys and girls playing soccer.
And books, books, books everywhere.
&quot;Normally there are bookshelves along the facade and there is a large dark space in the middle which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic spatial configuration upside down and moved the space for readers from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is skilfully used: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a home technology center.
The black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, window sills and stair railings, are a special treat.
The appearance, structure and smell seem alien.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
&quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials here,&quot; says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse municipality, when asked by the Standard magazine.
And so one day we came across a suitable agricultural waste product at a Frisian farm.
Millimeter fleece made of synthetic material has been used as a substrate under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands for many years.
It is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile will last one or two seasons and then it is ready to be thrown into the bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such a quantity - was pressed into boards with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and heavy-duty material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you get to the top.
At the end of the almost 500-meter-long journey, you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficuses.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly of the right air humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
&quot;You probably wouldn&#39;t believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled by the earth&#39;s heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass cover, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds will handle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as the &quot;long-awaited soul&quot; of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the town was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from their personal fund.
Thus, the optical gaps in the still not fully equipped library, which currently has 70,000 items, were to be filled.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are fully stocked.
&quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas.
&quot;I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
In this way, MVRDV got involved in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a bigger role&quot;
Germany abstained from voting on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think he will not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO prevailed here.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that they are currently changing their foreign policy from a policy that was, so to speak, directed by the US to a German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because the Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just settling into their role, but they are on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or Great Britain.
What exactly does &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows a readiness to take positions in the case of national interests that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, for example Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany&#39;s economic interests are to some extent different from the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to scare the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
That matters anyway.
But I wouldn&#39;t even want to attach too much importance to it, it&#39;s not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, it plays a significant role in German thinking anyway.
Did Germany&#39;s abstention on both important decisions, such as the Palestine vote, damage Germany&#39;s relations with the US?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding of the German position.
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t think it was as dramatic a turning point as in the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from it.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, was clearly in favor of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic politics.
I think that the Obama administration probably secretly has considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, he cannot take this position publicly.
I don&#39;t think the differences in opinion are really as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very enthusiastic about Netanyahu&#39;s policies.
Isn&#39;t it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think this is exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently happening.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European stance.
This is of course not easy for Germany, especially because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a touchy subject.
But I think that it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he even want to take over the lead role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role for obvious reasons.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes a bigger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
It&#39;s actually an old problem: we don&#39;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
US influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is currently not filling this vacuum. Who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don&#39;t like it, it makes them uncomfortable and will make them even more unpopular - c&#39;est la vie!

&quot;Brand protection&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, as is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection as long as it is not sued by the actual owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will get justice.
&quot;It&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney at the firm Taylor Wessing, which specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few more letters to register their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they will register Prada-Kny.
In this way, even German companies, for example the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder containing the records of the Stamp Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma trademark protected there. An artificial name that is also a parasite on the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The Chinese are known to be world masters at copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-story department stores that almost exclusively sell fakes.
But Pattloch&#39;s cases are different. On behalf of its clients, it is proceeding against Chinese companies receiving from the trademark office the right to use a mark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, an associated brand.
This word focuses on &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;.
This refers to women who prey on rich men.
Chinese authorities are not aware of any wrongdoing.
&quot;It&#39;s hurting business, we have to fight it,&quot; urges Pattloch.
&quot;The brand will be diluted, the exclusivity will disappear, the damage to the image is enormous.&quot;
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries run into the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
At €15 billion a year, China is the third-largest luxury goods market and the fastest-growing market, according to market research firm CLSA.
However, the removal of dubious entries in the trademark register is difficult to achieve and comes at a cost.
Proceedings can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch recounts cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the challenged name had become a &quot;market reality&quot; after a long period of time.
When the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes it&#39;s the law of the jungle.
Known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction equipment maker Sany, the company that had recently taken over German concrete pump maker Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
Chinese authorities are not aware of any wrongdoing.
The stamp office CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and premises.
But last year, allegedly, &quot;the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal&quot;.
For example, the number of pending objection proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
Nevertheless, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Doing something about it is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and marks the 10th consecutive year that China leads the list of new applications worldwide.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected in fees.
In simple terms, this means that each login costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros on average.
Starting a dispute against this costs several times as shown by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
This concern has been fighting against Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The Germans did achieve that his illegal production of imitation car parts was abolished.
However, the counterfeiter still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget it ourselves, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The stamp office CTMO also rejected the Munich company&#39;s objection.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg won the right, but the defendant continues to fight in the dispute to this day.
You have to be very careful
The matter is now being heard in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case will be brought to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: &quot;Management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot;
Internal costs cannot be quantified. They even had to look through hundred-year-old files in the company&#39;s archives to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party &quot;a high six-figure sum in euros&quot; to settle the dispute.
&quot;You can see what it means to us,&quot; Wentzler says.
There is a threat that the danger from the Far East will affect Europe as well.
And that&#39;s in the event that imitators secure unprotected brands there.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
The concern gave up this area of business activity a long time ago, but still managed to avoid registration.
&quot;You have to be very careful,&quot; says Wentzler.
Both he and attorney Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners should rather &quot;declare everything that is worth protecting in any way in China,&quot; says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs in the final act of its drama with the brand, then it will probably have to pay royalties on its own name in return, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, orphans of parents who died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there&#39;s the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women&#39;s pumps and men&#39;s loafers search the dance floor for a beat and find it quickly.
One two three four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise, urging, beckoning and chasing each other.
It almost lifts the 29-year-old conductor Fiet Hopf out of his textile shoes as he connects the voices with his lithely wild gestures.
It&#39;s Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
There were fifty male and female singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a human genetics researcher to a janitor.
&quot;Om&#39;Obani&quot; is not an easy composition, each choir voice has a different text and moreover in a very foreign language - Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that there are approximately 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans whose parents died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is already HIV positive.
For 180 orphans whose parents died of AIDS in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
You can take over patronage for 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees the child school fees, a school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means &quot;storyteller&quot; or &quot;one who praises&quot; in the Zulu language.
No one can speak fluent Bantu in this space, only sing.
For almost ten years now, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign soft language, and sometimes also bringing them back to where they originally came from: the south of Africa.
At an aerial distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the power of the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud or straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, you can see in a small way what the whole of Swaziland is: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the whole world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunocompromised virus. It is not uncommon for them to die in their early thirties.
This village was discovered by the congregation during a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a completed school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
At first, it was still a private effort by individuals, which for a few euros a year made it possible to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir of the &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; association was founded, which since then has been taking care of orphans whose parents died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ringworm and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Who belongs to the most affected group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydial infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (yeast), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
HIV is relatively rare among heterosexual adults in our country, but roughly 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV belong to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
Moreover, human papillomaviruses are often found among teenagers in our country.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is roughly one-tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent changes of sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most STIs and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the royalties the choir earns from singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
&quot;In total, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says the president of the association, Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village itself by Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can get her way.
She also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, for example with one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in the Zulu language, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them even took in 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children arrive on time in school uniforms every day.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisila, a lone woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; established a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get tested for HIV.
This is not a given. Even though the disease is so obvious across the country, everyone is silent about it.
A king with 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is absolutely taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot;
Quite strange actually in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
Black Africa&#39;s last absolutist monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his extravagant lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, this state-sanctioned way of life is also to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in the past decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are available for free on every corner, &quot;but nobody uses them.
The culture is different - unprotected sex.&quot;
In order to promote cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi Choir travels together once every two or three years to the south of Africa and sings songs full of sadness, militancy, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the Negro language - such an award not only brings cheer and joy, but has already brought tears to the eyes of many a wild frontier soldier.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, it is more than well known in the Ezulweni River Valley.
&quot;Go to Esitjeni, there is light,&quot; say the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see that light shines here too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that an ice sheet exists in the region of this planet that lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
This water apparently came from comets or perhaps asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let&#39;s not connect the discovery of ice with the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help us shed light on how water and other basic elements of life got to other regions of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved by earthlings, participate in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, pictures will be sent to Earth, small windows into the infinite distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a &quot;planet&quot; according to the International Astronomical Union&#39;s new 2006 definition.
This slice of Spitzer&#39;s infrared image shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, harder to identify are the pink-colored &quot;newborns&quot; in the birthing room of stars.
This star-forming region - scientists unromantically call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This changing glow of a dying star was captured by NASA&#39;s Spitzer telescope.
The donut ring is made up of material ejected by the star during its dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
The photo of the galactic &quot;cradle&quot; was taken by NASA&#39;s Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may appear like a red eye to observers in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the Earth&#39;s continent earned this nebula the name North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the originator of the unusual coloring.
The infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to photograph this &quot;baby&quot; among the stars in its full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn&#39;s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of Hubble&#39;s largest and sharpest images: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become real works of art according to their coloring.
The image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided into three parts, three-pronged), as dark streaks of dust divide the burning heart of this star maternity hospital into three parts.
Astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision in the Hadonosh constellation: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing toward each other and a collision must inevitably occur.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don&#39;t like technical abbreviations, you can call it the South Windmill.
This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a slice of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
Called Arp 273, this group of galaxies was spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call this larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This star nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of the stars gives birth to ever new additions.
Also, these star clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are constantly giving birth to new young stars. They are 5000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the entire universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the largest telescope in the world was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. The mirror alone measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches approximately eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap construction method: the telescope is secured by a hook at an elevation angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This is comparable to the world&#39;s largest reflecting telescopes, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), scientists search for extraterrestrial signals in space.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner who makes available their computing power can help.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - and it lives up to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also shine through the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO&#39;s Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to be a full 42 meters long and composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted on in 2018 at the earliest.
The two Keck telescopes on Hawaii&#39;s Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, looks into space with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be built - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope gives us the most significant impressions of space.
It has been providing us with images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The picture documents the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the Space Infrared Telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is ice even at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for several decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, launched in 2004 and the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now know for sure.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In South Azerbaijan, many people will live to the biblical age.
There is even a longevity museum.
Finding clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.

Finding clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Driving in the Talyš Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along a road with many bends along densely forested hills, raging rivers and simple farm buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the Black Forest.
But this here is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The Caucasian Talysh ethnic group lives here, about whom not much is known, except that they speak both Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This small town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from Azerbaijan&#39;s capital Baku is too difficult.
Eight hours are required for the 323 kilometers as the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulajeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
&quot;Baku was made famous by the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world here,&quot; says Fatulajeva.
She is the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the lives of almost eight dozen Talyš people from the surrounding area, who are over a hundred years old, are documented. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still fathered a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslümov&#39;s age seems extremely doubtful.
&quot;He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulajeva.
This man was said to have been married three times and had 23 children. He is said to have fathered a daughter at the age of 136.
Wasn&#39;t Şirali Müslümov wrong in his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, had heard about elderly people in Central Asia.
&quot;There is also a noticeable number of very old people living in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;and Sardinia also has an extremely large number of very old men.&quot;
However, due to the lack of documents, no scientific proof of age can be given, especially when the registers are missing.
A glass of melted butter every day
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik live to the biblical age remarkably often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatuljeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talys, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy does not seem plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayev lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butter churn which he tirelessly rocks.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva&#39;s sons and a daughter. They are both grandparents a long time ago.
Two small children are also jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for the guests, which is served in typical bell-shaped &quot;armada&quot; glasses.
Mirzaeva&#39;s white teeth form a perfect row, and she hides long dark blond pigtails under a scarf, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn&#39;t look bad and kept the color.
&quot;I also never used shampoo,&quot; says Mirzayeva.
A monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never once bought groceries in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But everything improved when &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took over.
Propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros). By local standards, that&#39;s an amount that can make a good living.
And maybe Mirzaeva&#39;s long-grayed son is right: &quot;Old people are held in high esteem in our culture.&quot;
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
Unless it&#39;s a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of &quot;human rights&quot; is missing from the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The bitter demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country&#39;s deep divisions.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is hotly debated.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We need to create a transition.
&quot;And for the fact that we succeed, I am responsible, before people and before God,&quot; he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, until now hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a &quot;state of God&quot; on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said almost apologetically that he temporarily limited the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to &quot;save the revolution&quot;.
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, neither the Egyptians nor the world is clear.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
The 234 articles that the rigid Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly hastily approved in a fifteen-hour night marathon are partly worrying.
As in earlier constitutions, this proposal says that jurisdiction is based on &quot;principles of Islamic law&quot;.
But what does &quot;principle&quot; mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use this unclear formulation and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this is clarified by the newly added paragraph: In all matters related to the Sharia, al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on all of Sunni Islam, must be consulted.
This may not, but may, mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over legislation, which would effectively deprive the judiciary of its autonomy.
There are many matters of interpretation in the draft constitution
Another problem is that the civilian jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served to suppress the opposition under Mubarak&#39;s rule.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
According to the proposal, the state should also protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values&quot;.
This is formulated so imprecisely from the legal point of view that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this section.
In plain language, it means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph explicitly defines the equality of men and women in writing.
On the other hand, another section forbids defaming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
However, it remains unclear what defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
The wording that &quot;insulting people&quot; is prohibited is equally dubious.
In this case, is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts enough?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Morsi will present for signature and, he says, will present to Egyptians for a popular vote &quot;very soon&quot;.
&quot;The Revolution Has Returned&quot;
For several weeks now, the opposition has been forming against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Cairo&#39;s Tahrir Square in unusual unison on Friday evening, vowing to destroy the constitutional document before it comes into force.
&quot;The revolution has returned and we will win,&quot; said Hamdín Sabbahí, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej declared that the draft constitution belongs &quot;to the dustbin of history&quot;.
Through the short message service Twitter, he accused Morsi&#39;s supporters of wanting to carry out a &quot;coup against democracy&quot;.
&quot;If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,&quot; said opposition member Jásir Said.
&quot;We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished,&quot; Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
&quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot;
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood announced a counter-demonstration, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who shouted: &quot;The people demand the application of God&#39;s law.&quot;
They called on Morsi: &quot;Clean up the country!&quot; and assured: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot;
The fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a situation similar to a civil war.
Morsi&#39;s supporters clearly did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country should go.
The majority in favor of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
&quot;The word &#39;human rights&#39; does not appear once&quot;
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is postponed by Hafiz Abu Sa&#39;da.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
&quot;And now the words &#39;human rights&#39; are not even once in the new constitution,&quot; he complains in an interview with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
Morsi&#39;s extension of power to all three branches of power in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
&quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the president effectively abolished it,&quot; Sa&#39;da complains.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Sa&#39;da also feels abandoned by the international community, which watches the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: &quot;You have created a monster that you can no longer control.&quot;
Norwegian rakfisk: The smelliest fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country&#39;s success be linked to the local appetite for an extraordinarily smelly fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet soccer gear.
Let it sit for a week.
That&#39;s how you get a sense of the paralyzing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway&#39;s greatest delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a beautiful view - and an omnipresent smell in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to stink.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, how best to say, most captivating food.
&quot;You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called &quot;Rakfisk general&quot; who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people are eating small cubes of fish and washing them down with copious amounts of alcohol.
&quot;Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,&quot; says Havard.
The drink can overpower the smell.
I&#39;ll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it&#39;s not so bad - it&#39;s akin to a piece of sushi that&#39;s been on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the fall.
Then in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they were pulled out and eaten - senses dulled by the alcohol, no doubt.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, most emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
Residents of Sweden, an old rival that until recently was much richer than Norway, are flocking to the country for work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, if rather smelly, part of Norway&#39;s past.
It is among the more expensive dishes on the market.
Everything is expensive though - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will set you back £9 ($14) each.
Norway doesn&#39;t often make the global news - and most residents seem to be fine with that.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is being called &quot;the July 22 incident.&quot;
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway&#39;s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world&#39;s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
&quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; says our waitress Anna, who with her long blond hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents the prototype of Nordic prosperity, as she serves plates of rakfisk.
We are, as you say, sensible people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is absolutely flawless.
We don&#39;t show off, we don&#39;t like ostentation.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - apart from a small percentage, most of the money from the industry is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else was blowing money they didn&#39;t have in the years leading up to the global financial crash, the Norwegians had their purse strings tight.
&quot;As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we&#39;re happy,&quot; says Anna.
&quot;And eat rakfisk,&quot; he adds with a carefree laugh.
I&#39;m standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I&#39;ve had enough of rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the smelly fish is here again.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places that serve rakfisk for dinner and where the guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding fish for the sense of smell.
They have a connection to the live TV broadcast, in which the presenter in a bow tie is surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It&#39;s like the Eurovision song contest.
&quot;What&#39;s your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?&quot;
“Here&#39;s our scoring, Havard.
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, possibly incapacitated by aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all that fish.
Mexico&#39;s Enrique Pena Nieto is off to a rough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC&#39;s Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city that is congested even at the best of times, steel barriers have been erected blocking several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico&#39;s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and assume leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has done well economically under outgoing Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
&quot;My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence,&quot; President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader are mixed even in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered fondly.
Citizens credit him with the development of tourism in the resort and the building of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement over the potholed and bumpy roads that used to be here.
Plaques with his name also hang on the walls of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive climate change museum.
&quot;We expect him to bring real and lasting change,&quot; says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state lawmaker for President Pena Nieto&#39;s Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We especially hope for the interesting and real changes in security and economy that our country so desperately needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted by Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected of Enriqua Pena Nieto within the party.
And he rejects the statement of the opposition characterizing the new president as a person without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward person, very engaged with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a great statesman and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state, that&#39;s not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Tucked under freeway overpasses, it resembles in many ways the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called in to help deal with drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, violence against women particularly acute.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in barren places next to a huge garbage dump.
During Pena Nieto&#39;s time as governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
At best, Pena Nieto&#39;s critics say he failed to adequately address the issue of femicide during his time in office.
And in the worst case, they accuse his management of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna, and chokes back tears.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
&quot;When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone had washed her body,&quot; Mrs. Buendia recalls.
There were marks of blows on him, and the post-mortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from a picture on the wall, right next to a cross with a single word: &quot;Justice&quot;.
However, this, the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker and a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
&quot;But that can&#39;t be right when there have been so many errors and omissions,&quot; he says.
The sash that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has vowed to make them a priority while in office.
&quot;I hope he will be the same president as he was governor,&quot; says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, military prosecutor claims
Military prosecutor seeks to refute Bradley Manning&#39;s claims of abuse in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning&#39;s time in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed based on Manning&#39;s rough treatment in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in US history, missed numerous opportunities to complain about the rough treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor maj. Ashden Fein cross-examines Private Manning at a preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede argued in Maryland that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during his nine months in custody in Quantico, Va., show no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing on the defense&#39;s motion to dismiss the case against Manning on the grounds of custodial abuse, a punishment in itself, came a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody .
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday&#39;s hearing, military prosecutor Fein went over with Manning the forms officers filled out after meeting with Manning at Quantico Detention Center, where he was held in maximum security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When asked by Fein about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as &quot;excellent&quot; and the overall treatment at the facility as &quot;very professional.&quot;
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the manner in which he was being treated, Fein argued.
Manning responded that he had verbally expressed concerns regarding various issues and that the officers who visited him had discussed those concerns with him and indicated they would address them, but had not noted the issues.
&quot;They wrote down &#39;no issues&#39; (after discussing the concerns), and that didn&#39;t necessarily mean I didn&#39;t bring them up,&quot; Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment in January 2011 when he met with the commission to assess the suicidal thoughts he had expressed on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that during that meeting, his intention was to get the &quot;injury prevention&quot; regimen down.
The military said it placed him on this restrictive regime (one level below suicidal watch) for his protection and the safety of others.
&quot;I wanted the custodial officers to know that I was fine and that I wanted to get off this injury prevention regimen ... so that I could enjoy an increased quality of life as I saw it,&quot; Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once passed out due to the heat.
He stated that not being allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was going on in the world around him was very disheartening.
&quot;My world just collapsed to Arifjan, that cage,&quot; Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said he struggled to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning stated that he always slept with the light from outside the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other way at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning&#39;s attorney filed a formal complaint about Private Manning&#39;s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about the allegations he made in Thursday&#39;s deposition that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico one night, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and fellow inmates during the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket during the count.
During questioning by a judge on Friday, Manning said he believed his guards ordered him to put down a blanket to cover himself, but admitted he was not ordered to put it down.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use the waistband of his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn&#39;t.
Manning testified that his underwear, his slippers and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that if he is convicted before a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and to fight the other charges because they are too extreme.
A hearing is scheduled to begin this week, with a military prosecutor expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations governing all arrestees held in maximum security custody.
Charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawfully causing intelligence documents to be published on the Internet, transmitting information relating to national security, and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made my way through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;) and the other for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Foreigners&quot;).
I stood there for a few seconds not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California and was called &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life.
It&#39;s an ethnic shorthand, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves &quot;Irish&quot; and my friends in New York refer to themselves as &quot;Italians&quot;.
So later I ended up with the &quot;Mexican American&quot; label.
But this was Mexico.
And there was no need to take shortcuts in my grandfather&#39;s homeland.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of a conversation in that language.
However, I don&#39;t have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can&#39;t shake the American accent.
So I pulled out my US passport and stood in line for the &quot;Extranjeros&quot;.
I was thinking about the moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
On the agenda were the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are just as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico&#39;s war on drug cartels, though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders at gunpoint to cede half of Mexico&#39;s territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere.
So the minute after a representative of the United States says something even remotely critical of Mexico, you hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about how Americans are encroaching on their neighbor&#39;s sovereignty.
And Montezuma&#39;s children set out on the warpath.
And yet the real challenge for Mexico is its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about hostile feelings?
There are a lot of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people to whom the country offers opportunities and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, who was in Mexico denied the opportunity and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person fit the profile - dark skin, poor education, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we are now living the American dream, going to good schools and having good jobs, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may be unclear at times, but our loyalties are not.
It is against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and view us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
According to them, our existence is only about failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would never have left it.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are and Mexican-Americans resent it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don&#39;t feel like a part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico they look at us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
And to further complicate relations, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia, I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as &quot;provisional ambassadors&quot; and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should be telling our fellow Americans how great it is to visit the country and press political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Well
So that won&#39;t happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren&#39;t sure it&#39;s a great country.
I have a feeling it&#39;s up to you, amigos.
That&#39;s fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel resentment for the way their family members were treated in the considerably more recent past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be a shaky basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such mishap is futile.
Amidst the usual unnecessary conjecture about who started it, many buildings were reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has upended the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the resulting chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think it may break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there doesn&#39;t appear to be much reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire struck on November 21 holds, this week&#39;s fighting has strengthened hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim they forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite killing several Hamas leaders and trapping the 1.7 million residents of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has not succeeded in destroying Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another slice of Palestine currently controlled by its arch-rivals Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained more influence, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas. So is Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Jubilant Hamas people say the Islamic crescent wraps around Israel, north from Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/militia rules, through Syria, where increasingly Islamist-leaning rebels may oust Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on Israel&#39;s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be excluded even by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the crate.
Israel&#39;s Iron Dome anti-missile system proved its worth and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as steadfast as ever. Many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
And most importantly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, thanks in part to the wall that extends into the West Bank, the main part of what might one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements. which are still growing despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party allied with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the campaign for the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why coddle those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn&#39;t they be firing rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
We&#39;d better keep them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
Perhaps the hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Although the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries have little love for Israel, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel&#39;s defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
That President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that must one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories - just like the bus that blew up in Tel Aviv last week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is making this situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody forays against Gaza every few years to push back Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides proclaim, most of the outside world, and this newspaper: two states, with Israel ceding territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that the ceasefire will give outside pressures at least a little more leverage to push the case.
Egypt, which along with Turkey and Qatar must push to stop arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Outside Arabs must also push for an accord between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has a part to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to enter the process.
This is woefully short sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Ugly cigarette packaging laws have come into effect in Australia
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, display warnings for smokers and diseased parts of the body.
Australia&#39;s unsightly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws, the first of their kind in the world, came into effect, replacing brand logos and colors with generic olive-green boxes bearing hideous images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and newborns sickened by their parents&#39; smoking.
Apart from the various health warnings and images, mandatory from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes are the brand names, which are printed in the same small font.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government says the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by de-appealing the habit.
It relies on studies that show that if people don&#39;t start smoking by age 26, there&#39;s a 99% chance they&#39;ll never start smoking.
&quot;Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell them with their product,&quot; says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of to be a princess
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that the bill would increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
&quot;This legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; says British American Tobacco Australia&#39;s Scott McIntyre.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in many more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Another claims that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said demand for silicone cigarette wrappers used to cover unsightly boxes had fallen two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain&#39;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their an appeal of the laws to the Australian High Court, raised from almost zero sales.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stock.
It&#39;s a good deal for us.
As a potential snag, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
&quot;If you&#39;re a marketer in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space left to promote your products, the online space is an unbeatable place to be,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. .
Ms Freeman saw an increase in brand ratings on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook by the &quot;average Honza&quot;.
We have to ask, is this just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and went to the trouble of making this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how it will deal with the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization that say trade is unfairly restricted, despite none of the countries doing significant business with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001.
They have now expanded to over 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia are defiant.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
&quot;You just take out a cigarette and put the pack back in,&quot; says Victor El Hage while buying a pack with a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there is only one reason for me to quit smoking and that is my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack newsagent in central Sydney, says the uniform boxes make it harder for him to line them up on the shelves.
&quot;It used to take me one hour to unload, now it takes me four hours,&quot; Yu said.
&quot;The government should just ban them completely, then we&#39;d be like, &#39;OK, that&#39;s it, let&#39;s close the shop,&#39;&quot; he said, throwing up his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it&#39;s not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won&#39;t lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some researchers and child development experts are increasingly coming out in praise of boredom.
They say it&#39;s good for us (and our kids) to be bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don&#39;t have a chance to enjoy boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I&#39;ll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at Canada&#39;s University of Calgary and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011), says.
&quot;In fact, boredom has a long history,&quot; he said.
A Latin inscription relating to boredom has been found on the walls of Pompeii, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of &quot;wanting to do something that would satisfy me, but not being able to&quot;.
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that in apathy there is no urge to do anything.
He says that at the heart of boredom is a &quot;disruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and a sense of time passing slowly.&quot;
Boredom can look a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may be related, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we&#39;re bored when we&#39;re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading an article from magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly they barely noticed it, while a third group didn&#39;t hear it at all.
Those who listened to the TV program in silence reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating but weren&#39;t sure why and attributed the trouble to boredom.
When you&#39;re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distractions can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study&#39;s authors.
On the other hand, when you&#39;re doing something boring, &quot;like looking for bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.&quot;
In fact, he said, we now know that doodling and doodling, often viewed as signs of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
&quot;Research shows that children who are allowed to move around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,&quot; Professor Fenske said.
We&#39;ve all experienced boredom at one point or another - my flight being delayed, a blaring speaker, a particularly long movie.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the Boredom Proneness Scale in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions such as: &quot;Many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous,&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I don&#39;t have time to do them all.&quot;.
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
However, teenagers are generally apathetic.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren&#39;t at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knows that &quot;adolescence is a prime time for boredom,&quot; which is largely due to children and youth not being given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, &quot;Is boredom good for you?&quot;.
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse substances as a way to relieve it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have debated the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the issue for more than two decades.
&quot;Boredom is the brain&#39;s way of telling you to do something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn&#39;t always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not long term.
So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they won&#39;t be bored anymore, but they won&#39;t learn how to entertain themselves or self-manage, Professor Fenske said.
And &quot;this independent management carries over from one situation to another,&quot; the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don&#39;t think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn&#39;t be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant hum of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
&quot;We accuse her of needing to be even more bored, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful,&quot; he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
&quot;In an environment where we&#39;re constantly overstimulated,&quot; he said, &quot;it&#39;s hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise shuts off.&quot;
There is no handbook in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old college student and football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing felony charges for something that will soon be legal statewide -- possession of several grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said he was driving with some friends one day in September in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was pulled over.
After an officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia -- petty offenses that carry a $100 fine each -- and a court date.
&quot;They treated us like criminals,&quot; Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following Colorado&#39;s vote to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the answer to hundreds of minor drug cases depends on location rather than law.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession cases have already been dropped here and in Washington state, which has passed similar measures.
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 and older for possession of the small amount that will be legally allowed after the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado&#39;s more conservative districts said they would continue existing marijuana cases and still charge people with possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains west are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their municipalities.
&quot;This case is moving so quickly that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads.
And they&#39;re looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sales - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
&quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith conceded, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
&quot;There is no real precedent to follow,&quot; he said.
Washington&#39;s law, known as I-502, takes effect Dec. 6, which also leaves a one-year vacuum during which the state&#39;s licensing system will not yet exist, but legal possession will.
And there are tricky mechanical questions that must be worked out during that time, such as how to balance the state&#39;s &quot;appropriate access&quot; directive to licensed marijuana with its ban on the sale of cannabis within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds or child care centers.
&quot;Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On Nov. 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers informing them that the city attorney would no longer prosecute any citizen over the age of 21 for possession of a small amount of marijuana and that police would &quot;effective immediately&quot; stop charging people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, though many face additional charges.
&quot;Our office is charged with prosecuting criminal offenses that were criminal offenses at the time they occurred,&quot; Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response was also complicated in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county&#39;s largest city, no longer charge adults with possession of small amounts.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all pending possession cases.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of government and the legal system was never going to be easy.
And the mixed reactions across the state have revealed deep divisions among local officials over this grand state green experiment.
For district attorneys, that&#39;s a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
&quot;They&#39;ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can&#39;t really accept that it&#39;s legal,&quot; he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Advocates and state officials are planning new boundaries for legalized sales while also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still plans to make the sale and cultivation of marijuana federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates hope the Justice Department will relent.
Despite several attention-grabbing arrests of medical marijuana sellers and patients who use it, the federal government has mostly kept medical marijuana shops open in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While drug agents likely won&#39;t be kicking down doors to seize a small bag of the drug, they are likely to balk at allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana businesses allowed by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to President Obama&#39;s administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for action from federal authorities.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, though it will be about a year before any stores can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose proposed a six-month ban, which is likely to go into effect next week.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to be in a situation where we issue a license to someone and then have a big federal issue out of it,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We look at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a Conservative.&quot;
Today&#39;s university students are not the only ones being attacked for their views.
I don&#39;t remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world&#39;s greatest seat of knowledge, a modern wrapped Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And yet, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of entering Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and plunged into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I gave it up because I objected to making love to the students in the next room.
Writer AN Wilson famously declared that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a member of the Conservative Party.
You may wonder why I&#39;m bringing this up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of right-of-centre students are suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Year Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say they are &quot;often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwelcome&quot; because of their political views.
They are calling for the creation of a position on the university&#39;s equal opportunities committee, which would ensure that they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student politics, which portrayed Tories as freaks and neo-Nazis.
The program featured alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and carried a silver-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as &quot;scapegoats&quot; because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday&#39;s newspaper that &quot;left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we&#39;re like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting us.&quot;
Corpus Christi history student Samuel Roberts, 21, who is behind the movement for more protection, says such a climate is &quot;unpleasant&quot;, while OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill, 19, says there has been a deterioration in JCR members&#39; attitudes towards people on the right of centre.
&quot;This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion as well as the well-being of members,&quot; he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was in the minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was most fervent.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deny former student Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree because of cuts to higher education funding.
The atmosphere would make even Stalinists tremble with fear.
During the first few days of induction week, when new students socialize with each other and with professors, I got a taste of the wormwood to come.
I discovered that not only do professors tacitly condone the poking of conservative students, but they even participate in it with gusto.
The politics of the miners&#39; strike, privatization and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid South Africa were brought to the wood-paneled auditoriums.
My first lecture was on the translation of an 18th century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
&quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot;
It was pretty stiff for me.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake batter, was very bilious.
&quot;Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French or are they just plain stupid?&quot; he asked.
The other students snickered.
Tears welled up in my eyes.
&quot;I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, that is, if you&#39;re not too busy with social affairs,&quot; growled Professor Pitt.
Devastated, I returned to my room.
I was sitting alone during dinner at school when I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
It was a second year student named James who introduced himself as an OUCA member.
&quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It&#39;s bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it&#39;s going to be even worse for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I made a cowardly attempt to pretend.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Thatcher said.
This ploy proved unsuccessful.
A first-year philosophy, politics and economics student who (what an irony) went to Eton said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.&quot;
You are infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
&quot;How Do Conservatives Love Each Other?&quot; asked one.
They beat each other up, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to hang out with like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn Labor and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years unfolded before me as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher&#39;s foreign policy adviser and one of her speech writers.
He was almost not there.
He hated the place for its provincialism and pettiness, and for its leanings towards a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
&quot;You won&#39;t be happy here,&quot; he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents&#39; house in London, seeking refuge with my dispassionate metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn&#39;t believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
&quot;But it&#39;s the best place in the world,&quot; he said pathetically.
They wouldn&#39;t do that, not in the city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends always had perfect manners.
His moist eyes darkened.
Try again.
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions.
The following week during class, when another history professor declared in all seriousness that I was an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing inside with shame, I admitted that I was &quot;brainwashed by my parents&quot; and called them &quot;old fools&quot;.
The relief was only short-lived.
My father drove the nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for Murdoch&#39;s newspaper.
My door was locked.
I cowered inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snooty wimp.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and vitriol in an educational institution.
But even more tragically, it was Oxford that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also hides to this day behind an undeserved reputation as a place of equality and freedom of thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to fame&quot;
ABC spoke to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous clients of the Italian designer on the occasion of the &quot;Valentino: master of fashion&quot; exhibition, which opened this week in London.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective &quot;Valentino: master of fashion creation&quot;, which presents more than 130 high fashion models created by his atelier over the past 50 years.
&quot;I adore this castle,&quot; he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani is the only protagonist, but which could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is bursting with private correspondence and photographs signed by the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international &quot;bohemian cream&quot;.
There&#39;s nothing wrong with liking royalty.
&quot;At least they don&#39;t stick a starling cigarette in your great carpet, like some wonderful pop-music celebrities do,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
We both lived in the Alps in the 1960s and 1970s and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests lavishly and with elegance.
&quot;We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad,&quot; explains the ex-wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
&quot;Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And he&#39;s still a star.&quot;
Valeria Mazzová performs Valentino
Even the Argentinian model Valeria Mazzová does not forget the designer&#39;s charisma.
&quot;It&#39;s been many years since we went to his place for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, his spirit was reflected and felt in everything.
Thanks to him, all the invitees could feel important and loved,&quot; recalls the top model, who started working with him during Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
&quot;He will never go out of style because his designs are works of art,&quot; he concludes.
A show of nobility
Gravani&#39;s life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly requited loves.
He loves people with good breeding and better titles and they love him.
One of Somerset House&#39;s galleries has been converted into a distinctive seventy-metre-long arcade that offers role-reversal: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the arcade to observe a dream &quot;audience&quot; wearing Valentino&#39;s masterpieces as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in &quot;Night&quot; or the wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg shine in the audience of mannequins.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like a first love, &quot;you can&#39;t forget him&quot;.
&quot;I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, a shirt, a &quot;gillette&quot; vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection of 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,&quot; says Naty Abascalová, one of the designer&#39;s muses.
&quot;I prefer him to others because of his femininity and his great love for women, because he underlines our beauty,&quot; adds the former Duchess of Feria.
&quot;I really like the colors she uses, they really brighten and give a &#39;sparkle&#39; to the face.
The proportions are perfect.&quot;
Even princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d&#39;Arenberg can&#39;t forget how she first dressed Valentino.
Growing up and living in Italy, she longed to come of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns...
It finally arrived in the late 1990s.
&quot;I bought my first Valentino dress for a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a ruffled skirt, a ruffled bodice, and a strapless top.
It was a dream come true,&quot; says Rodrigo d&#39;Arenberg&#39;s widow.
&quot;Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless,&quot; explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d&#39;Arenberg has stored the designer&#39;s formal dress &quot;very carefully... because a dress is not just a dress, it&#39;s also a set of memories that they have inside&quot;.
&quot;King&quot; of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller&#39;s wedding dress from her wedding to Pavel Grýký in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;girls&quot; (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create this ivory-colored silk dress with sewn-in pearls, twelve different types of lace, and a four-and-a-half-meter train.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority in the specialized press, these dresses represent a landmark of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of high society clients&quot;.
Valentino, dazzled over the years by an elitist &quot;savoir-être&quot;, is now its best example.
As Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy&#39;s highest decoration), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani amasses as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
&quot;My attention was always attracted by his elegance, calmness, well-groomed and perfect appearance,&quot; admits the Princess d&#39;Arenberg.
&quot;The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
He was flawless, time had not left a mark on him.&quot;
When the princess says it...
The hardest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano region
For four euros, porters in the Indonesian volcano region gamble with their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
Such is the case of Ant Wijayi, one of 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, he has to work his way down to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulfurous gases escape from the interior of the Earth and turn into a solid state when it comes into contact with air.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, but it takes over 40 minutes for the exhausted porters to climb up at a turtle&#39;s pace as they keep their balance and carefully consider their steps to avoid slipping and plunging into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could cost them their lives, as happened to one French tourist who fell off the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners at Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
Once at the top, they make their way past tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry the heavy baskets to a scale the mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has mined the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupiah (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as the mineral has a place in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
&quot;Because it normally carries 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and he is broke at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
While this seems like a pittance for such an inhumane effort, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
&quot;The daily wages of miners here are very high. For example, picking coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros),&quot; explains a porter who used to work on a tourist island Bali as a bricklayer.
There his salary was 75,000 rupiah (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not that hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as compelling as sulfur in Indonesia: &quot;He married I am with a young girl from Bali who is Hindu and I have taken her to Java to convert to Islam.&quot;
Anto has asthma, his breathing is difficult, he is constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, his breathing is bad, he is constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
That&#39;s the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
&quot;I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in more than passable English.
This likable and intelligent young man, struck down by fate, could be a tour guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead he works as a porter.
He shares a dirty wooden shack with other porters and gets up at two in the morning every day because the sulfur keeps bubbling up at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto walks into the crater and lights his way with a small flashlight that he has attached to his helmet and bought with his own money.
About 400 bearers carry baskets with sulfur from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has high revenues, it has not mechanized the mining of sulfur to save costs, nor does it provide any equipment to porters working on their own and with such efforts.
In fact, they don&#39;t even get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photography fee that, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance fee, the park rangers collect from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human inhabitants mules.
&quot;This work is for the cattle, not the people,&quot; counters Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will keep working &quot;as long as possible&quot; because he needs the money to pay for the education of his three sons, aged between 18 and 10.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly shifts and traps the miners in the thick fumes that rise from the volcano, the miners are so tough that none of them complain of suffering from serious illnesses... but it is evident from of their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are then transported by three trucks up a steep path through the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to retire, I&#39;m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,&quot; Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide with several teeth missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, 30 years old, also makes a living by mining sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the hardest trades in the world persists from generation to generation - the trades carried out by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame not having children on career, stress and the cost of living and education.
&quot;Singapore&#39;s population needs to grow.&quot;
I am married and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot. Let&#39;s fulfill our civic duty and give birth to a new life!
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of an advertisement for menthol candies, but despite it - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The lines are part of a rap that uses local innuendos such as &quot;put the bun in the oven&quot; to mock Singapore&#39;s birth rate.
Advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that with this ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a humorous way.
The agency&#39;s artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people do &quot;their civic duty&quot;.
“This is strictly an internet thing, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing our population, so we felt it was a topic we needed to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying a lot of things like spreading pheromone perfumes or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought why not do the most creative thing possible, like compose a rap, to solve this problem.&quot;
1.2 children
One who doesn&#39;t take this very lightly is the Singaporean government.
It spends $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government&#39;s Marriage and Family Package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides cash benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, taking into account the stratification of the population, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered the recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don&#39;t Singaporeans have more children anyway?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Bureau&#39;s Marriage and Family Department, says this is because of &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities&quot;.
&quot;So people have a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it&#39;s not just marriage and family,&quot; he explains.
These changes in social norms contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the delay of marriage and childbearing. The result is a decrease in Singapore&#39;s birth rate.
While there have been efforts within immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a countermeasure to population decline, this has created resentment among local residents.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore&#39;s ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While declining birth rates have known effects on national economic growth, tax revenue, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unintended consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Urban Development Authority has begun regulating the number of small apartments known as &quot;shoe boxes&quot; that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that these flats may promote a youth lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of development firm EL Developers, says their &quot;shoe boxes&quot; are selling far faster than larger houses.
“They are more popular, selling days to weeks faster than larger homes.
That&#39;s why they&#39;re so much better for our cash flow.&quot;
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could aim to boost the nation&#39;s birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district suggests they won&#39;t have much of an effect.
&quot;People are always stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, so many people put it off,&quot; says the young official.
&quot;Let the others have children.
But for me it&#39;s important to rely on my own money and time,&quot; says another young man in his twenties.
Both men and women cite careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is still Singaporeans who have the final say on starting a family.
What is private offline is also private online
Privacy.
According to the dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or &quot;an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any intrusion&quot;.
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed when he publishes matters on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as &quot;something completely personal&quot; on a personal level and as &quot;username and password&quot; when it came to social networks.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t share my biggest secret,&quot; says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy on places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he&#39;s had accounts for two years.
&quot;They are top secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world,&quot; she claims.
&quot;On FB I post nice photos or photos of us playing.
I also chat with friends there.
I wouldn&#39;t share a photo that wasn&#39;t mine or a photo that would make fun of someone,&quot; he says.
This boy understands that it is wrong to post obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them is the mother, who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
&quot;I started a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don&#39;t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends,&quot; he says.
He says without hesitation that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
He wouldn&#39;t even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn&#39;t know.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and on the last mentioned network he admits that he does not know 20 people on his friends list.
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,&quot; he says.
According to this boy, none of them asked him for anything, nor did they ask for his address or phone number.
&quot;If they pressured me or required me to, I would simply remove them from my account,&quot; he admits.
José signed up to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to what is now called cyberbullying.
&quot;They blackmailed a friend&#39;s acquaintance on the social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never found out who it was,&quot; he confirms.
According to José, the victim did not log out of the account.
&quot;She just activated private mode.&quot;
It then explains a series of steps to set up your account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
&quot;Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or if I just wanted to.
Even though I know it&#39;s cyberbullying,&quot; she claims.
Key questions
Marielos Porrasová, English teacher and graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and teenagers to navigate social networks correctly, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
He states that: &quot;The Internet originated as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed.&quot;
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a Yale graduate in education and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these terms to explain the phenomenon.
&quot;Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the age of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning ourselves,&quot; he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic &quot;because we are asking them to discern what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature&quot;.
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - prudent, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, have thousands of friends and not think about the consequences&quot;, he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and teenagers what privacy is is to ask questions that make them think.
&quot;Telling them not to do something doesn&#39;t work,&quot; he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn&#39;t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone posted your photo the way you posted a friend&#39;s photo?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag people in party photos, have you asked for their permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone need to know what you&#39;re doing all the time?
Another point is for them to realize that they have to behave in the Internet environment the same as outside it.
It&#39;s the same rules.
&quot;A person is guided by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and it should be the same on social networks,&quot; he claims.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, explains that it is essential that parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
&quot;If they understand the intricacies of each, they have a good basis for talking to children about the consequences of setting up an account online.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published,&quot; he says.
Guardia believes that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of &quot;don&#39;t talk to strangers&quot;.
The South American Summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the issuance of the Lima Declaration that was announced and reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
The Efe agency repeatedly tried to get access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of heads of state and government of the Unasur organization, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the President, who initially stipulated that they would publish the document after the end of the summit, said that it would later be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
They further stated that the content was released by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several brief press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound, with the message &quot;confidential session, audio disabled&quot;.
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokesmen of some of the governments who were present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Peru&#39;s presidential office later sent out an email to the media with a &quot;final statement&quot; from the summit, but it is only a statement from President Humala, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, despite being eagerly demanded by the press.
On ASPA&#39;s official website, it can be seen that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure the broadcast for all journalists, but completely blocked the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru&#39;s President Ollanta Humala and Chile&#39;s President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will hear arguments from both sides on Monday in the case launched by Lima against Santiago.
&quot;We will submit and execute the judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court,&quot; said President Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
&quot;Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts,&quot; added Piñera and greeted President Humala with a handshake next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they will abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia this week adopted the Bogota Pact, expressing submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which Colombia considered to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the impeachment of then-president Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning&#39;s speeches and closing the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements had been adopted and activity was planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments amounting to 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the accepted agreements, he mentioned that the member countries of the UNASUR organization will take &quot;important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended.&quot;
He informed that actions are being supported to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, for better availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America and for joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters&quot;.
When Europe is in crisis, &quot;(Latin America&#39;s) economic consolidation should not have a victorious essence, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our peoples a better future,&quot; added Humala.
&quot;We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links in different parts of South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a speech read.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concern better connections with Ecuador, but he did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
&quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return it to the Union of South American Nations&quot;, from which it is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to continue to be a prosperous and peaceful region that is integrated and has good neighborly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the judgment of the International Court of Justice regarding the maritime boundary dispute, which is contested by Bogotá.
&quot;It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),&quot; Santos said.
&quot;We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, not even a treaty with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with that country,&quot; he emphasized.
&quot;I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate way possible,&quot; Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta.
As part of the summit, Union Defense Ministers tentatively met to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defense of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last-mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which &quot;South America, in this case, really needs to learn from Europe.&quot;
Correa, who was attending the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told state television TV Perú that Europeans &quot;killed each other in World War II&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are practically one homeland.&quot;
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which the member countries of the Unasur organization support.
&quot;It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which is already happening among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still regressive areas that want to return us to the past,&quot; he pointed out.
Among other things, the Ecuadorian president stated that he agrees to the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who signed the San José Pact on human rights are taken into account.
&quot;Those who are in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles and respected his &quot;deep democratic values and human rights&quot;.
He added that at the time &quot;there were reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process&quot;.
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary for asking him to be questioned on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while &quot;Swedish&#39;s own legislation allows for the questioning to be carried out by video conference call, which could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London&quot;.
Correa said there was a risk that Assange&#39;s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
&quot;I have not spoken to him since he has been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious,&quot; the Ecuadorian head of state said.
&quot;However, there is a danger that his physical and psychological condition will deteriorate, because he is confined in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
This would affect everyone&#39;s health,&quot; he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, based on a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, stressing that talks have taken place with London to resolve the incarceration founder of WikiLeaks.
&quot;We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there were constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange&#39;s lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings in various European instances,&quot; he mentioned.
He stated that &quot;if Great Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over&quot;.
And if Sweden interviews Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as is easily allowed by the legislation there and as has already been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be put to an end.&quot;
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, clarifying that he absolutely does not tolerate &quot;mediocrity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression&quot;.
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, vile and depraved politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail,&quot; he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, &quot;nor bankers, nor hegemonic countries nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador&quot;, and said that if he is re-elected, &quot;he will continue to make changes in the right way and in the right direction&quot;.
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay on the membership of the Unasur union at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole &quot;must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and putschism cloaked in legality&quot;, because in fact it &quot;destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy&quot;.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said that he considers &quot;completely appropriate&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
&quot;This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly so that they can be overcome and there is an opportunity to move forward.&quot;
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime boundary dispute, which Peru and Chile are handling in the same court, and expressed the opinion that &quot;it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, however harsh it may be&quot;.
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third mandate in a row, he noted that he perceives this possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult&quot;.
Correa has stated that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
&quot;Personally, I have never been interested in power, but such unjust situations as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to accept that responsibility,&quot; he said.
&quot;If I won, it would be my last term as president and then I would retire from politics.
If we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I&#39;ve already made up my mind,&quot; he said.
Correa also mentioned Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez&#39;s new medical treatment in Cuba.
&quot;I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says President Chávez left for scheduled routine treatment and was expected to return to Cuba after the campaign.
This is not a recurrence of the president&#39;s health,&quot; he explained.
Today, the Ecuadorian head of state attended the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
&quot;It was like a bolt of lightning struck me,&quot; he says, recalling the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to &quot;mitigate a little bit,&quot; but apparently to no avail.
The boy kept it a secret from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own shoulders and started to learn about it. And with such commitment that he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), where he came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic did not say goodbye to him &quot;because he had a cut.&quot;
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their illness and only come when the virus has destroyed the organism and weakened the immune system, and then they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, &quot;it means a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment in time and in an appropriate way is exactly the same as that of healthy people&quot;, said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, stating that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, with better those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, &quot;live up to 75 without problems if they follow the treatment&quot;, the doctor explained in the interview.
To emphasize this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the death rate has decreased significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Yearbook of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that that since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics, 60 percent of patients have died.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 by May of this year. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die from disease?
- &quot;It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have not run out of medicine. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the infection, i.e. at a late stage of the disease.&quot;
He adds a compelling figure: &quot;Nine out of ten patients present when some associated infection is already evident. The only thing that needs to be done to make a greater impact on the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier, and that&#39;s why testing for the disease needs to be offered on a large scale to all persons who request them&quot;.
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco, as well as directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests done in a private laboratory only because his friend did it, and despite his young age he had already developed AIDS and was also suffering from Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
&quot;Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don&#39;t want to know anything else.
&quot;If I&#39;m going to die, I&#39;d rather go out three times a week,&quot; they say, but that&#39;s not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthily, I exercise, I take medicine.&quot;
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
&quot;I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person,&quot; enumerates Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO newspaper, so that today, as part of World Day AIDS motivated those who are afraid with his testimony.
&quot;Let them get tested. If they&#39;ve taken a risk, let them know as soon as possible if they&#39;re HIV positive, that&#39;s better. And if they&#39;ve already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they&#39;re responsible.&quot;
This message of his summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who investigates HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, &quot;the distribution of condoms has really increased, before they gave us one or two, today they give us packages of a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms&quot;, he said.
Teenagers are among the most susceptible to new infections.
&quot;What do you want it for?&quot; is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and medical personnel that teens want to avoid, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective division. Let condoms not only be behind the counters, but let the hundred of them be found in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
&quot;It&#39;s not an endorsement of promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of &quot;paying them beer and a motel,&quot; as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There is no such sexuality. It is best to make condoms available to those who are already having sex,&quot; he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
13,435 cases were recorded (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
This state ranks fourth in Mexico in new and established AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of the infection takes place through sexual contact, 6% through blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people may be living with the HIV virus, as for every registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The ruling upheld by the United States Court of Appeals, which does not recognize Grupo Vitro&#39;s bankruptcy debt restructuring in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national business with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the corporate restructuring procedures allowed under Mexican law do not appear to apply in the land of the stars and stripes, despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court for North Texas effectively leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of confiscation of their assets on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for the major Mexican glass maker to appeal to the United States Supreme Court on three irregularities.
At the outset, while the judge in this case says creditors should follow United States bankruptcy law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico are the main procedure.
Firstly, it would indicate ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, which appoints the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without the vote of the branches from the internal corporate structure, where the indebtedness of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognized, the required majority to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican law allows this option.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intra-corporate debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors - who were against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. &quot;vulture&quot; funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have achieved a majority.
They would get about 45 percent to 37 in the vote.
This information is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the severe economic crisis that hit the United States.
In the meantime, González Sada&#39;s family business will file an appeal for a new assessment directly at the Court of Appeal, so that the assessment will take place with a full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since only three originally voted.
If he fails here, he will seek a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court, as a remedy.
What is significant about the case is that the court omitted a document submitted by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae detailing Vitro&#39;s procedure under the Bankruptcy Code and pointing out that the company made it easy for itself by going along with the agreements signed by both countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
In addition, it is pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules designed for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
A criminal complaint filed by the Mexican aviation union against former business owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraud, has been on the table for months without notice, and according to the pilots&#39; union, the bucket has already overflowed.
The instance, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which it accuses of obstructing justice.
According to her, the control office systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Republic about the transaction carried out by this businessman, during which he withdrew 198 million pesos from the IXE bank from fideikomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the chain of Posadas hotels.
Siege of Dragon Mart
On the campus of the Universidad de Caribe, a group of local and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens met over the weekend and approved the creation of an association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as is known, about a huge trade and distribution center for products from the &quot;country with a great wall&quot; aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area in the lower part for employees from 150 companies.
The Canacintra organization (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) had already been able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose the monumental site, which would partially devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all opposition to industry.
End of the ACTA matter
The Senate&#39;s request, which was ignored by the government and which demanded an explanation under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known by its English acronym ACTA, has lost its relevance, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, the development company Homex puts on the market investment certificates for 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer interest repayments every 28 days.
Competival is born
By bringing together leading companies in information technology such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, an association was born with the trade name Competival, whose goal will be the software services market in Central and South America.
The investment in the business will exceed 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball was my life&quot;
Basketball legend Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of local basketball history as Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, both as a junior player, a player in the BSN National Basketball League, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League , or the president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
&quot;I have held many roles throughout my life in basketball, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN National League, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s,&quot; Reyes recalled when Primera Hora newspaper reporters visited him at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all, he guards those commemorating his time with los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
&quot;Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with Los Vaqueros starting in 1967, either as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a string of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted in BSN.
That&#39;s when &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz took over the team, who was an excellent leader,&quot; Reyes said.
&quot;I remember Gene Bartow, who used to coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, said to me, &#39;I&#39;ve got a six-footer for you.
Do you want him?&quot;
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then referred me to point guard Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brought Bayamon a championship win, Gausse would contribute to the next one.&quot;
Gauss enjoyed the championship when he played for the Los Vaqueros team, but only from a distance, because in 1988 he was already acting as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his duties and enjoy Mincy&#39;s placement in the national team.
&quot;I remember the first time we beat the United States in an Olympic qualifier in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championships where we finished fourth, but we should have gotten bronze if it wasn&#39;t for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final throw-in,&quot; Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup squad the best national team you&#39;ve ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba when we won gold and beat a United States team that was pretty similar to the one that blew us bronze at the World Championships.
That team not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also the youngsters (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales , who was unable to make the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had a perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualification in Neuquén, Argentina.
With roster players like &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner filling in for players suspended for brawling at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was Puerto Rico&#39;s best player?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved results at this level like Piculín.
Not to mention his tenure in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
This is very difficult.
We had a very good generation that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Of the young ones, I really like the work of Leo Arillo.
Which of your achievements in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN national league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you not have time to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, that the boys from Ponce would play only in their region and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
It pleases me.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos of music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;JR&quot; in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon JR Ewing on the TV series Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as JR in the new Dallas series, died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to an official family statement provided to The Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros.
&quot;Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he loved most,&quot; his family said.
Larry&#39;s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
&quot;Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death in a Dallas hospital,&quot; announced her agent Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
&quot;He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest,&quot; Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before Dallas aired, Hagman made a name for himself on television as a decent guy in the lighthearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a genie) played by Barbara Eden and takes her home to live together.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film appearances included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman&#39;s masterful performance as the incredibly repulsive JR that propelled him to stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan &quot;Who shot Dzhejar?&quot;, which was supposed to raise expectations for a work full of emotions, when Hangman&#39;s character is almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculations of viewers around the world, but also risking millions of dollars in bookmakers.
This also helped the episode achieve a viewership record.
The November 1980 episode in which the answer was revealed averaged 41 million television viewers. Dallas thus became the second most-watched entertainment program in history, after the end of the series MASH in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
JR was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin got pregnant with JR and he then threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn&#39;t leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiably greedy man with a charismatic smile: a scheming businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) locked up in a mental institution.
&quot;I know what I want JR to have on his tombstone,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, &quot;Here lies Honorable Citizen JR Ewing.&quot;
This is the only thing that didn&#39;t work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was &quot;brilliant on and off screen.&quot;
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new series of Dallas were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
&quot;Filming of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth is currently being filmed,&quot; the TV station reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue after Hangman&#39;s death.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, fathered by her lawyer husband Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the stage in New York and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The married couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities stay.
In 2001, he published an autobiographical book, Hello Darlin&#39;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
&quot;I didn&#39;t put anything there that I knew could hurt or harm someone,&quot; he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he became involved in the promotion of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital, where he helped fearful patients.
&quot;I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go for surgery and after,&quot; he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of &quot;don&#39;t worry, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you will be fine&quot;.
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
A course that explores the &quot;end of the world&quot; begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to do a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew the lure was irresistible: The end of the Mayan calendar&#39;s &quot;long count,&quot; set to come on December 21, was seized upon by many as evidence that the end of the world is coming
Charmé, however, had no idea what was in store for him in the next few months: A catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget impasse that some are calling &quot;debt Armageddon,&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, where doomsday Christians say the Apocalypse will begin .
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,&quot; Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you look at what&#39;s going on in the world today, like we have 30 days left, it&#39;s a really good time.
And remember, bad means good to the apocalyptic minded.
And he&#39;s not the only professor offering courses about the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches a course on &quot;Means, Culture, and the End of the World.&quot;
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
&quot;We&#39;re looking at why these ideas expand over time,&quot; he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real-life examples.
&quot;I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable, believable and impossible,&quot; Vacker says.
On Pennsylvania State University&#39;s main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course simply titled The End of the World.
&quot;We&#39;re not adding &#39;2012&#39; because we&#39;re always open to running the course again if the world doesn&#39;t end,&quot; Restall said.
Despite the &quot;imminent doom&quot;, students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work &quot;right up until the evening of the supposed end of the world,&quot; Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
&quot;It stretched into two hours,&quot; Restall said of his course for high-grade students, of which 35 have signed up.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails asking if there was still space.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
&quot;I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, 23, a religion and sociology major from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so an apocalyptic, secular or religious mindset is just a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalypse movies.
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a class in which it could be taught before,&quot; he stated.
&quot;I&#39;m enjoying it.&quot;
But no student, let alone professor, interviewed said they believed in a December 21 end date.
&quot;Our first project was about a Mayan prediction, and we&#39;re kind of debunking it,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
&quot;The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it&#39;s just a key point in the calendar,&quot; Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, in which people respond to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet caused this speculation to flourish.
&quot;Elsewhere, people don&#39;t think about it,&quot; he said.
This happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond when asked if he knew of any &quot;end of the world&quot; courses there.
&quot;The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, indicating an exception to the high office.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall noted that there has been talk of many doomsday dates over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, &quot;people immediately start thinking about the next date&quot; or philosophizing that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors alike.
A few said they intended to go to the &quot;end of the world&quot; festivities.
&quot;I&#39;ll probably call a few friends to laugh together,&quot; explained 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
