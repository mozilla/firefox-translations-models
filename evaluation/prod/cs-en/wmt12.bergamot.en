Parliament did not support the amendment to the liberating Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal a section under the amendment to the Penal Code, on the basis of which opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko was convicted.
The adjustment to open the way to the liberation of the imprisoned ex-PM was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the proposal to commute the sentences for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not final; the court is to hear the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the ruling a political vendetta of the regime, the suspected bias of the court was triggered by the trial in the West.
The motion to drop section 365 of the Penal Code on the ground of which the ex-PM was sentenced to 147 members supported the vote.
His approval required 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and is over the war without it.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the county, the election will be won by the Islamists, but the issue is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the common law of sharia, and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the theft is mowed.
Women can forget about emancipation, any apostates from the faith are about to be extinguished, and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a company consisting of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would not want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the aforementioned Libyans for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters took advantage of the help of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, it was not an American general who was driving NATO airstrikes, but by Allah, whose size they celebrated in each hilarious intervention.
So when the victors are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in a shootout, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the dictator's person without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy Libya militarily.
This leaves the locals with the problem of expelling the "cruckers."
But will they have, without the occupation of the oil company, for a kiss of Libya's black gold?
They may well not be, and the west will finally be able to boast of the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, it will be mistaken by those tributaries of the Sharia law.
A new era of crisis is about to begin.
The focus of investors was France and the rest of Europe
The statistical whirlwind swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-quarter, with Germany and France growing.
But the bond market is breaking records for records today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The eurozone's statistical authorities, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have released preliminary estimates of the economy's third-quarter economic development.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries adjusted the second quarter data, in which Germany, in addition to the better than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it had emerged in a slight 0.1% decline (the original data was indicative of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
Quarterly, however, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Key issues:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the first term.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally converted data.
The economy of both the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical borders.
Problems are also starting to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields for Czech 10-year bonds are holding below 4%, even as the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate the 200 million run
The football team has managed the toughest task of the season!
In Černá Hora, thanks to the great Czech and a beautiful goal, she won 1-0.
Czech football, even with a big portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from the home leg and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the postseason match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great portion of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, also thanks to their home game in the end, the great Czech and the hero Jiráček won happily 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate their progress to the European Championships.
The Montenegrin, due to the precise defence of the Czech Republic, came under pressure in the second half.
The struggles of the match became Damjanovic and Vučinič, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of around 200 million crowns will be added to the Czech national football box office.
Ever since the opening minutes, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams found it difficult to get involved in the combination and were played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of the home footballers did not come in the first half either, as the Czech defence kicked long pitches for the defence with precision.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
Created a living shield
Several hundred undergraduates created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
By their gesture, they want to express their country's support for their country's nuclear program ahead of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the premises at noon on Tuesday and then cheered the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred students at universities in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, which processes uranium.
They are thus showing that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran did not appear to have stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isphin exhaled nuclear facility and then hailed the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack to paralyze Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, the target, in addition to the Isphhahanic center, the Natanz facility in which the uranium is enriched would also be targeted.
The menu of the obese child: does not eat and dine sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with an oversized weight of 9 per cent of schoolchildren and 5 per cent of children obesent.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it is shown how important it is for the healthy development of a person to the environment in which he grows up and the patterns he is surrounded by.
On tables by obese children, for example, sausages appear up to half as often as they are in families of children with a normal weight.
Fried fries had a dinner day before the research associated with an awareness-raising event called Obesity is no coincidence of more than 19 percent of the obese.
It is also not customary for sports in fatty families, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of children replied that their parents would find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year's school year and was attended by nearly 900 primary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity event, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have joined the project.
The right diet and plenty of movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically rising number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, the only half of those polled said that she eats five times a day in breakfast-snaut-nauth-snapped-feather-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and dinner evening
Experts point out that relative details are also essential for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was the realization that a tenth of households would not eat at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more likely to be consummated in families of obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary lemonades every day (70 per cent).
While more than 40 percent of surveyed children regularly play sports, the result was less than half - 15 per cent - for their parents.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own menus from the options on offer according to their own taste and self-awak.
"The eating preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are a long way to ideal in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favourite dishes are a lot of flour, meaty and sweet dishes.
"The big popularity of sugary sodas is particularly alarming," the final report on the survey reads.
For lunch as a main meal, pasta triumpkin prevailed just over the poultry.
But the children were practically not wanting legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes is also low.
A tendency to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"For the survey participants' inspection group, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Notit Explanatory Lecture, there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of a healthy diet in a number of cases," the results of the project read.
It was striking, for example, for sugary lemonades, where more children would prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to tick off the poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire, restricting sugary foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, pros say
In the opening article about how stylists are taught, I complained a little that there was a lot of it in the opening hours.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures in three industry pros, dressing up problematic characters, and a seminar on how it goes on set.
And it gets worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "trodden."
This time, the director Alice and I were discussing (there's not a single boy in the course) how to dress up a woman who doesn't have a perfectly co-directed figure.
And the vast majority of them.
Some have a short neck, some have a boyish figure with no proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually soften the broad shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We were given tips on how for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist, to highlight the figure nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that skirts or pants really don't fit, then it is worth having at least one of those tailored pieces made.
You certainly won't regret it, because perfectly fitted clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that keeps moving, heating, removing at the waist and the like.
The boy's character, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with algae, apps, embroidery or recruitment.
There are, of course, many of these information and character types, so I'm glad to have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework assignment, that's enough for it.
Each of the female attic received an assigned celebrity to devise two outfits: the day and the evening.
We have to take into account the current look, the fashion style of the personality and the type of character.
I'll be "dressing" Mirand Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
In my mind I am, for me personally certainly better than the kind of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has gained perhaps a hundred pounds recently (take, please, consider exaggeration), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print them and then graphically process it.
Moodboard, as the result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to the graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic side of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only wear physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific terms of reference, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that's not until Sunday.
Stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, charged with information about the types of characters, was sparked by three industry-specific guests.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt like a cape, but you can also dress it on a bare body, put on pumps and take pictures of it as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But I praised the following advice the most: "You need to know the rules perfectly for your work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
Finally, I can see why we are crushing all those precepts, what to combine with, to what to do, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist must have many more clothing options ready than they can take pictures.
So with the fashion story, which will have ten pages (that is, ten outfits), I have to be ready to "run" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo of the outfit, the outfit looks and works in combination with other pieces at times quite different from the real.
So we have to expect that when creating an outfit.
That image and style sometimes do up to half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but image and marketing have made her a world-class star.
In the Czech Republic, so far, access to the use of stylists services is rather cold.
Even the familiar faces sometimes find it unnecessary (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look like it is secondary).
And if someone has already made a styling from us, then we're supposed to be counting on dictating to us a completely different (smaller) size than it really does.
Then there's nothing to do but Google and see if the tabloids wrote about the fact that the celebrity had grown in/jumped, and the like.
Both Honza and Mario were telling us on Sunday that it was not enough for the stylist to navigate fashion and be able to put together the outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to judge people, not to be undergoing, to stand up for your opinion.
"When an executive orders you to sort through her wardrobe and add nice pieces to her, you can't throw out her the whole closet and say, my God, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you praise and recommend what they're to be worn for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "placmant" or set bag must contain.
It's the one you turn around your waist and you carry all the necessary propriety.
In addition to clear things like scissors, a roller for hairs or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with it the stylist helps himself to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special cliques to clip the back of the outfit if it is bigger (the pin or other clamps are not allowed, they would damage the garment), or a sewing.
So we wouldn't just listen, but they'd actually try something out, we learned how to properly susten wear the shoes.
Even with a photo shoot in a studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outdoors.
So we glue and glue.
We must not touch the shoes with scissors, lest they happen to be damaged.
So it takes a real skill.
Mario was pleased to see me at the unreservedly compliment.
The aforementioned skill is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we've heard on the second weekend of the course.
It's becoming more and more clear to me that it's not a walk in the park to be styling on a professional level, no matter what anyone says.
Need for Speed: The Run races across America.
Review
The initially carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary lajatry errors, turns into a routine morning ride on the shift.
The ambition has been largely fulfilled, but it is no avail it to make no difference when no one seems to want to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, attracted high expectations before it was released.
He promised to move the age-old Need for Speed racing series again in a new direction, appearing from playable previews as a game that might not only be in the number in the field of action racing.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages would turn out, in which the main character would get out of the car and run his own way.
But, as is customary for the NFS series, much is a bit different in the end than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole draws down some unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for more or less for several years.
So it's not really even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are inducted into a story whose main character, Jack, has some personal problems and is offered as a solution to participate in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel, you get on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your job is to arrive first in New York.
The idea entails some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn't feel like the game's always the same thing.
In addition, some of the backgrounds are very nice to look at, even though the technical level of the graphics is consistent with the previous parts of the series.
So it's not a big deal.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains feels visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are made up of some atypical element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you get stuck in a sandstorm that reduces visibility considerably.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be caught by an avalanche.
Alongside this, the individual races are pretty well in a row.
There are only a few types of them, but that's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then catch up again (the classic duel with the stopwatch) and then there is a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
This is what the police get involved from time to time, making your whole effort even further unpleasant.
The new feature is the passages outside the car.
It's more of an interactive animation, when Jack usually flees from someone and you have to help him do it by printing the right buttons in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprising that there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would have expected (specifically, perhaps only three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above, thus ranks among the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means it's definitely not something these days, but you can't say he's a mess.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more accurately conceptual racing of the driving model here still fits quite well, even though we could find a better one for the competition.
So far, so to speak, everything in perfect order.
But problems are starting to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not very well.
We don't expect a game of this type to count the complex deformities and collisions, but when you have no idea before any crash to any object how your car will behave, then I guess everything is not quite right.
Typically, when you're overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, you can sometimes just latch each other, but at other times in an almost identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even to fuck off.
The reboots system doesn't particularly matter, but it will make you feel good.
The reboggarts are designed so that if you smash or go far out of the track, the game will throw you back to the last clue on the track.
But only five reboots are available in each race.
If you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
It is, therefore, more of a tool in case something goes wrong than to be able to rely on them in a downright way.
But sometimes even the reboots don't help, solving them only when the need to learn the given section of the race from memory.
The big ailment of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply won't fit into them.
At other times, you will always meet "civil" cars at the site in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It will be annoyed especially in situations where you see the opponent driving in front of you between the two oncoming cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around them or brake them.
It doesn't matter when you reach them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation is always just in front of your nose.
The rivals also have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will come across a few places where, again, regardless of time, you are always overtted by the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the most at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get there in front of you at any price.
When he rides ahead of you, it worsens your insight into oncoming cars, so you probably get a nice little bit there at first.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fuelled, but the design is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgust you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and, in places, action so much that sometimes you literally can't keep track of where what flies.
And it doesn't really matter whether the credited to the concept with the fifty unique tracks, the gearshift of the races so that boredom doesn't have a chance or anything else.
The unconventional idea is to replace cars during the races.
You have to be careful of the gas stations by the roads, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can make do with what you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, heavy American highway crashs, and exotic supersports for technical riding, such as winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and a story.
For obtaining a higher level of driver, different items are unlocked: from the cars to the background for the profile.
It is also again linked to the online feature of Autolog, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides additional community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (so be so), where you are in the dark to whiten down the tracks (see).
The speedometer is flashing the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (let me) and in that there will be a subway train coming from behind and uncompromisingly scrapping you.
In the newsroom, we will probably still have to spend a few more days discussing whether no one really thought a little bit when creating the play, or whether the authors think of us as really such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is not a big one, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and, in a few cases, even great.
It freezes in the fact that in some of the more tense imaging drops, in some cases quite tragically.
But it mainly concerns crashes with more participants, when seamless imaging would no longer do you any good.
The sound side is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audiences, the soundtrack from the category of "every dog a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that, because of listening to music, someone will probably not buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so highly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game feels unfinished.
Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared to be framed in the eye by the power of the airport headlights.
The National Churches of Sciences of Charles University will be heard at the concert Students of Velvet

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly upset the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to stabilise a bit, calm down a bit and before all the players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of the lecture, she took her motto "Incliroscriptly and openly about Europe" was already pointed out by the first part of the lecture, when she was able to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envy her.
Viceen also praised the work of the new Permanent European Council President Herman Van Rompuy:
"There was first a criticism that it was bland, that he was a grey official, that he could perform no role, and I have to say that it took everyone's breath away that he had done his part very well."
"He is a man who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, communicate excellently with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in response to the question: 'Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call?", that is, as an important step to unify and amassize the EU's policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from the whelks
Vice has also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived in, is alive and will be alive in the near future.
She described the previous year's Czech Presidency as a success.
The Czechs dealt with the incoming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was described as a major negative, which very badly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, "effect a rush" was not only the Presidency, but also the ensuing financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is being significantly complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slender and economical, which sectors will take precedence, which countries will be supported more and which are less, all on the agenda for future negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, which she came to Brussels with: 'About Europe in a clear way'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, parlance that no one understands.
How is the citizen to understand that there really are no curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that we really have to be banned from the whelks."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multiskee-finding Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, it is annoyed by the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
A lot of factors are to blame, she says, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak is coming, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you seeing, what about your Visegrad Four?" and he doesn't look at it enthusiastically."
In the future, according to Vicen, the Union is mainly facing new tough rules on the budget policies of the Member States.
He sees the concept as very real, rather than a new "European federation" rather than a new "European federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the space of Schengen, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries they wanted and the ones they didn't want to work together to stand by."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a very two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the promotion of the principle according to which all the topics that have an impact on the whole Union are to be discussed between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM's innovator begins second century of existence
If someone were looking for a word that expresses IBM's strategy most accurately, the closest thing would be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, the company is seen as very contemporary, and yet it has been a century since its inception.
The basis of this longing were laid by the company's first chief executive, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became an imprint about which the future giant's life (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us IBM, long-term thinking is a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century because it remained true to its basic values, not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred we will be able to achieve even more of this," the company's current director, Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson approached the care of his employees in the 1930s in the same way as the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were one of the first U.S. employees with paid leave, employer insurance, plus an elegant employee uniform, and a sophisticated system to reward best inventors and businessmen.
The same elaborate long-term IBM has had a relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant at talent gaining from the start - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to be replaced by a woman - Virginia Romett, at the head of IBM, at the forefront of IBM.
She has been with IBM for 30 years, still holding the position of Chief Executive of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called jams in recent years, online brainstorming, which arouse many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there are enough ideas - there are nearly half a million people working at the company.
Institution with a good name
A firm position in the business is provided by the company's strong internal and external image.
"From the start, IBM had the concept of the institution rather than just the technology company," Harvard Business School and author of the book's book, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, told the Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using the technology," added George Colony of the consultancy firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, it is different between entering the market and thus creating the market outright.
IBM - or "The Great Blue," as it is famously dubbed for its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is perhaps the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infra-trachurcture, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from media outlets to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Her invention includes an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy digger.
IBM, with about $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first is Apple) when it was overtaken by Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers, and the times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2, Prodigy's online services or the IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on the forward movement, you can't get emotional about the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, say, rival Microsoft, which essentially stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
Services accounted for the largest share of IBM's sales, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
As recently as 1990, he was the strongest representative of the hardware with a share of more than half of it.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yielding assets, investing $58 billion over the same period to buy prospective technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the legacy of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis intact.
IBM's share price has risen by a rocket 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the company's net profit is steadily rising.
IBM's corporate password is to change everything, just your values, not.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM history: From cheese slices to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally with the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It did not take over the name IBM until 1924 - originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was given by the merger of four firms whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technology such as the famed "sticks," the clock recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of rival Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then eclipsed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on the unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese slices to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson ran the company, turnover doubled to $9 million and the company's widespread expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that after nearly forty years in the chief's chair, he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA control space flights to Merkur, Saturn, and, in 1969, the famous man's flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360.
The classic "Pécéka," which established the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the computer production to China's Lenovo, while buying the consultant's PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself to high-added-value consultancy and services.
The strategy that has paid off for the past three years by IBM is the Smarter Planet concept, the "smarter planets."
It aims to make smart use of technology in hitherto, as yet or not, as well as unplanned areas, and to improve the situation in the transport or urban management.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM CR, it also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition.
Rychtářová on the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you don't want to do the donkey, I don't want it!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and come home.
But now he no longer intends to wait, and she has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová in her home in the summer, she did not seem to dream how her marriage would end in the end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany at her urging for 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, had forsaken her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
Quickly not interested in who his wife sleeps with
If the speedster and Bartošová had broken up once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live to live his life in our shared house, no one will expel him."
"However, he will be reliving for him not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, noting that she has already detained herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Josef doesn't mind the fact that Darina closed his back door.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change that."
"My wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company keeps going, taking care of repairs, gardens, real estate, shopping."
'Daina and I talk to each other just as we don't share a bed,' said the speedster.
If Rychtářová also found a new love, she said, she would not stop her.
"We're not sleeping together, and I don't care where he's going, who he's going with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst female bad habits: Do they concern you?
If you ask the men if they could list any typical female bad habits, as a rule, they all spill them out of their sleeve very promptly.
Dear women, can you see each other in the following lines, where there are a few female bad habits who can perfectly pour out the blood in men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop and collectively at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can refer to shopping as a habit.
Some women are aware that they should at least restrain their buying passion a little.
But tell me, which would resist just taking it around the clothes shops, looking for well-fitting tops, and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the stalk?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's possessed by the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are downright allergic to how their partners complain about their looks all the time.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaining increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Wash windows, vacuuming, mopping the tiles, dusting, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean paving, the children's filthy, for soiling the scrubbed sink and abovering the glassing living room, with the polishing of which you went to so much trouble?
In case you suffer from this "distraction," try to realize that nothing is to be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand in the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can jeopardise your relationship and family well-being.
The sifting
"Bet the used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow, too?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner like this several times a day, know that you can so reliably dial it.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make sure everything is in order.
Perhaps, if the men had known, the women wouldn't have to dig that all that much...
The slandering, the gossip
For some women, gossip, gossip, but also insults and associating against someone are also owned.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a small, harmless gossip or a gossip to release it here and there.
Hand on heart, it's my own to all women.
But the opposite is the gossip of the grossest grain, which they like and often gossip, perhaps despis each and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the female work force.
Jagr and Voracek helped with assists in Philadelphia win
Hockey forward Jaromir Jagr has had two assists in Philadelphia's 5-3 win at Carolina in Monday's NHL game and is once again at the top of the Czech players' productivity in the competition.
The 39-year-old star's review was mined on both occasions by Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the game's best player.
Two assists in the match were also scored by Jágrůvic's teammate Jakub Voracek.
After the match, Jagr claimed to overseas journalists that he had predicted Giroux a big night.
"I told him before the game he was going to give a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that feel to come over," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the team's second hit also had a Czech footprint.
Voracek fought the rebound behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the rings to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer was reduced to the break, but the start of the second leg again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, the Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored the third goal, then his shot was converted by a run in the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," said Jagr of his center.
"I never thought I'd play a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That's what I'm happy about."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates were trying to play me, now it's turning to," added Jagr.
Carolina made the game a drama, with a goal from Tuom Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who broke through on the penalty spot, came within one goal.
Another complication, however, was not made by Matt Read, who finished the two-on-one.
"He did well to intervene in our Pronger band."
"He hit the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) drove to the far more bar."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voracek said, describing the last goal of the game from his point of view.
Philadelphia's victory topped the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček missed the game against Buffalo, withdrew in the second period due to an upper-body injury.
Candiens lost a two-goal lead alongside the experienced back and lost after a penalty shootout 2-3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomas Plekanec.
The home coach was annoyed by the extensive sickening of the back row, with only five defenders finishing the game.
"It's bad."
"We only finished the game with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The rotation rotation was on us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moving the puck from our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defending P. K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 saves for Winnipeg in a 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which broke a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agents at the time were overwhelmingly selling only trips to the socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus travelled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (the German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (the Balathon).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when there was a chance to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime went to the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered tours to the West, but you needed to queue up overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who were thus unable to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without the foreign exchange promise it was not possible to raise funds (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
However, the most frequently spent Czechs vacationing in the Czech Republic, resulting in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs purchased and this custom survives to this day.
The travel of the Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in the countries around the world.
The huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to us for the most popular Croatia to date in 1989, as it was part of what was then Yugoslavia.
Early in the 1990s, visa requirements were lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits to Austria's Vienna or Germany in particular.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to at least take a moment to see it.
In Paris, for example, the tours of Czechs in parks in tents were sleeping, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czechs' travel at this time was to drive their own food, preserves, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely after many weeks of years.
However, our standard of living standards and, with it, average salaries were rising, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare tours with charter air links since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came as soon as 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight to exotica was dispatched from the Czech Republic, to Thailand.
From this year onwards, every year with Czech tourists, direct charters to warm far-off countries, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are now visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US revoked visas for Czech tourists, and in doing so, our country was finally among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in their history (50.3%) and spent more than 15 thousand on one foreign holiday, including the cost of their stay, for the first time in their history. CZK per person.
The general meeting is to find the chairman, but again the threat of a stalemate
For almost five months, Czech football is without its chairman and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting that will take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
There is still no agreement on which electoral code to proceed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest of leading Czech football is to be attended by Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned his post in June and, as he left, called on colleagues to unite and find a strong figure to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hass era, football slipped back to the fight between the two Solarian chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This became fully apparent on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov for nothing, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just the way to choose.
Nor was there to be a consensus on who had the right to actually vote for the pile - whether only the statutory representatives or even the functionaries credentiquely mandated by the power of attorney.
There has been a partial consensus on this one point since then, helped by a recommendation from the Constitution for the State and the right under which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there is still controversy over the Electoral Code.
It has not brought much clarity to the situation, even the Executive Committee, which is already addressing basically nothing else in its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: what to do in the 3rd round to avoid the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the FACR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
Under the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to take a concession to win a candidate who gets a higher total of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must get at least a two-thirds advantage at this percentage count.
"But then it would make sense of the two previous rounds, that would completely deny the bicameral concept," the Freedom Party of Moravian understands the objections of the Moravian Freedom Party, according to which it would be the best order not to bend and vote according to the existing statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the statutes set by the electoral code suit Pelt the most of all the candidates.
"I wish you to vote at most according to the statutes."
"To make no substitutes invent any of the proxy nonsense as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his comments defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said, the new chairman will be known and believes the candidates will work constructively together in the future.
"All passions will be reassured by the national team's possible progress at the European Championships today."
"Frenchball will be on a happy streak again, there will be more willingness to work together," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience in managing football from the whole of the trio at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very ambivalent."
"This is not among the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposefully adapt the regulations."
"This may cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"I hope, however, that common sense prevails," Rajchl said.
There is little time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generalite will be complete at all for the match.
The aerial special, in which the vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and was looking for a replacement option to transport part of the Executive Committee to the barrage retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial-level meeting that may be reportedly on Wednesdays will be crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobeš, would like to induce the divided parties within the country's strongest sports association to agree.
There is a lot in play: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík is in the fight for the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
Had the head of Pilsen's football team, Tomáš Paclík, seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have entered the battle for the top job.
"If there is a quality adept, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one like this has been found," Paclík told the Czech Press Agency.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, he is chasing Paclík's motivation to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favourite of the election, from his way to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also stresses that, if he wins, he would only last until 2013, when a full general meeting is on the agenda.
In the job, he would like to see, he would like to see an experienced and top-level manager who is not very attached to football events.
"I have spoken to some of the people who would be considered."
"It was crazy for me when some said that at the moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most bothered by Pelt's association with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes, who is known at the backstage as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the delegates' vote at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta will be in the chairmanship position.
"If he'd won, the current state of affairs would be mothballed, and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"Combined with the support of Berbro, who is a skilful businessman, it would not do football any better," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name was mentioned years ago in the wiretaps in the investigation of the corruption affair, but from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know the prestige of football's victory would bring."
"And how we would also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking in his former statement with perspective that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became the chairman."
But if Paclík triumphed in Thursday's election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
So is another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as head of representation."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I also don't have my nose where I can't do it," said Paclík, who drew great attention in September by being behind the dismissal of the referees' committee headed by Luďk Macel, who was replaced by Dagmar Damk.
Paclík says he would dare to lead the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, which celebrated its premier league triumph with its support in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Board, which goes all the way to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to, for example, Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider one of the priorities to be the strengthening of the FACR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby for political leaders to get more money into the lottery tax in the sport.
"It is one of the key things the new chairman should address."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their reasoning, but they must be honest with where the money will go," he noted.
As a burden, Paclík now does not take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he claims that the president of the FACR should be "over-party."
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point of converting my shares in the Pilsen club to one of them and returning there in a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new FACR statutes to rule out electoral stalemate
Two days before the Football Association's general meeting, one of the candidates for president, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make the cut in the event of being elected to give the FACR new statutes that would ultimately rule out disputes over the electoral code in the future.
The Jablonec functionary is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the election battle will be significantly dampened by the eventual success of the football team today.
Before the September non-realized election, Pelta had already promised to focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the last-minute election before the general meeting, so the two-month delay could be useful to defend his ideas about the management of football and introduce him in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect to be known by the chairman on Thursday."
"It feels it is high time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who served for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
He therefore believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that behind the current problems with the election are the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the General Meeting in June, the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they didn't allow for different interpretations, we'd had the chairman since September," Pelt pointed out.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he conceived as a decoy to the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task, and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a matter of principle that we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he continues to try not to define himself against his rivals.
He had previously announced that he could envisage working with Henry Raychl, whom he recognized because of his legal training, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack for a long time against Tomas Paclík, who, on the other hand, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some successes."
"But his attacks were undignified, and he caught a lot of people off guard in the election campaign."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," he said, addressing his opponent's address to Pelt, who is said to remain true to the proclamations he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a showcase for football.
"And I'd also try to end all the affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the repercussions of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would rush to the meeting with the private and state sectors right out to secure enough money for the whole of football," the 46-year-old candidate told the Czech Press Agency two months ago.
He also promised then that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any staff purges.
"I would have to get acquainted with the duties of individual employees first," he said to Strahov, where there is an understandable nervousness from the long limp.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only point of contention is how you vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and he will gain that only by finally having his leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before perhaps the decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that FACR would start working hard under him
If the current vice-chairman, Jindřich Rajchl, had been elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Meeting on Thursday, many people in the association would say not be pleased.
In fact, Rajchl promises that work will start to be worked hard if he is elected.
It wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I am not saying that I do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech News Agency.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee so that each member is devoted to a certain area."
"And I'll be handing out my homework hard to take a mile ahead of football in each segment."
"I don't think it would make a lot of people happy because work would start to be really harsh and not just criticized by the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he had considered not to run again.
"I'm known to be doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question my every move," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"This is a trust that I cannot just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he began with Hasek.
"A great deal of work has been done over the past two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that will not be in the aftermath for example a few years' time, and I would not like to be stopped by someone," he said with fear that in the event of the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation on the union could return to the time before Hashk.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's the thing I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him, above all, there are people who would do football in such a way that it would only be for the elect."
"There are a lot of things to be blamed on me, but certainly not that I'm siding with anyone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
'I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones,' said Rajchl.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"It would not be such a current situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, also joined the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that clear achievements are behind me," said Rajchl, who sees saving tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the negotiation of televised contracts and negotiations on the Lottery Act as his achievements.
On the contrary, he makes it a co-winning thing that the union does not pull together.
While he claims to be "discredited from returning the trust to Czech football," the second of Paclík's opponents is considered a strong candidate who has much to offer football.
"No one can dispute that he did a great job in Pilsen for that year."
"If he'd been elected, he might have gone on with the things that Ivan Hasek started here, and he wouldn't have changed the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage," Rajchl says.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
The paddling from the point of view of Ufono, a sumptuous swimming pool in Budapest: Those travelling in Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after exploring the cities or travelling to let their tired legs rest in the thermal spas.
The book will show where the wellness is the most beautiful by the water.
As Iris Meder made the trip in the past one-and-a-half year of the previous year, she was not to be absent from her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on the outing on the water, looking up at the artistically formed dabbles, swimming across from the marble putti (I'm standing a little naked boy, a child (with wings) who were waiting for her at the edge of the pool, admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked the swimming pool, she took it in an instant to his notebook - with remarkable details of the building's way of building and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by the architect Meder and now presenting them in their just-released book "Badefreuden (Radost of Swimming) ": the People's Swimming Pool Pourings, the historic palace of swimming pools in the Schwarzwald,"Tvrdé core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries ran it with her "Travel for the most extraordinary spa in Central Europe": Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia at all times.
The 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of swimmingly culture.
It's not too much to do with the sport, says Meder - it's just different in the water.
The only thing to say about anger is that swimming fans have to settle for the blue tiles and the stench of the chlorine, while runners for health can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the hilarious chatter of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so hideous," says the living Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started to gather nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the jumper pool and the essential oil for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much to the Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real eye-bath: "You have a water surface in the baths instead of the floor."
"It's both transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visually doubled: a tall vault, a colorful tile, a diving board.
The Maloforming Image Volume "Badefreuden (Repacking Fund)" provides on 190 pages everything that is needed to know about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellnes - but it mainly arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens were discovered by the swimming pool collector Ms. Meder in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spa, like the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the Neskynova bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal baths, whose swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberno).
The spectacle, on the other hand, is offered by many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria. While you can see the whole city from the Zurich Exorical Baths, you can take to the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton look at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: There is a window in the steam bath from which to watch the commotion on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool is expected by the spa guests in Längenfeld: Aqua Park Ötztal looks like ufo, which has just landed in the Alps.
From the top of the open pans in winter, the steam rises in the middle of the Ötztalu mountain towered into the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector, Mrs. Meder, climbed into the nostrils of the chores.
Many of the thermal baths are smelled of sulfur, in the spa of Árpád in Békescsbaba, Hungary, it smells of fuel oil to the point where one hardly believes that you have made it to the healing spa.
The smell comes from a healing water containing alkaline hydrodenhlicates, which is almost black and whose sediment is adherent on the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather odd wellness experience.
But one place was also disappointed by Iris Meder in his search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate baths Luhačovice, she came across the enclosed terrain.
In 1902, the architect Dušan Jurkovič's designed spa was closed in the meantime.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-and-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds between the tiles grow massively.
The intrusion, on the other hand, was built in the magic swimming pool at the Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already been under the course of construction for three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Newborn elements that date from the time of its creation in 1844, but also the Alhambra-style Maori Hall, which was connected around the r. 1,900.
Since the meticulous modernisation of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for the swimming pool connoisseur Ms. Iris Meder, and not only because she comes from the Schwarzwald.
"It's already a feat, combining such a diverse building essays in such a beautiful complex," says Ms Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is probably a marginal issue.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to be vetted by commodities trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank abandons its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the chief executive wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Indeed, two-thirds of those surveyed demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions pull out of the deal because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study relies on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author, Harald Schumann, shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is driving up prices to the height and banks are therefore together to bear the world's problem of hunger.
The Consumer Protectorate campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although bigwigs such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Initially, commodity bets were thought to insure traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk deals have taken away from supply and demand - and made profits in the poorest's behalf.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to criticism from Ackermann: He promised to test the complaints and say that no deal "is worth betting that Deutsche Bank's reputation be placed on a bet."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group controls the complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The check is due to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to do so.
Then, in late January, bank officials want to say what consequences they will draw.
At the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch's chief executive Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but he also reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are now hurting the common good."
Let Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, live up to the obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items from its portfolio that is used for food price money," Bode said.
"It is not as to whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with hunger-suffering people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Concern chief would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he left office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive officer of the board of directors differently than planned would not pass to the supervisory board.
By revocating disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - that should be dealt with by his successor in the end.
One in two would testify to investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released a poll in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is eleven per cent who consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: Every other would testify as a result of the poll all the investments in which the money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 percent would warn acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said they would think of quitting their account and switching to another institution.
21st-century house in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: The Austrian Pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and ravaged.
It is now being opened again as a showroom.
When it boils for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold boomes and new building materials that are typical for faith in technological advances, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karel Schwanzer for the World Exposition of Brussels is apt and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and lofty-looking steel and glass structure.
The building is still seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect's name so that he also built the Austrian Pavilion for the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus key-formed by a secondary building in Munich, he was finally famous for 1973.
His as a temporary exhibition building, the projected pavilion was placed in the Schweizer Garten at the Südbahnhof (Sithological Station) in Vienna, and in it they opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named "Domench of the 20th Century" House.
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither in spatially nor technically - the walls for hanging the art exhibits were missing, no compliant climate.
Yet it was used until contemporary art received a new booth in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and dilapidated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, now bears the name "Town of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition there - a happy intention in every respect.
A new start for Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, has taken hold.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a prominent career, a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and, as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed for a major renovation with politicians and monuments, procured public funds and private sponsorship money, and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the work of sculptor Fritz Wotruba's foundation should be exhibited, a cafe and a bookshop should be created, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
To perform, Krischanitz was then the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him to view exhibitions "nextly every weekend."
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness in its relocation to Vienna and the change in use.
The current reconstruction was far more of a problem: the building was a "catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced, with glass fibres reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Refrigerator bridges-steel girders were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were sanitized.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provided lighting, with a bridge leading to the entrance - a near-new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish brown colour tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
All under the strict supervision of the Heritage Office and the low budget.
"Often, material had to be found that was good and inexpensive and also liked the monument office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult, he said, with the pavilion "that came here from Brussels," Krischanitz, typical of "Drop-in-the-City-history," said it.
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "fake proper self-confidence."
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in an undesimely place, as an urban happy coincidence has occurred: A completely projected "City Quarter by the Central Station" with office and condomincant houses are created in the wake of the Schweizer Garten circuit.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: The 21st-century House could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as can be heard, is already in talks with the city about the neighbourhood at the post at the Schweizer Garten site.
The runway is planning a package for the winter crisis in the millions
The runway has pined out an emergency plan to prevent train disruptions in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported tentatively, citing an internal group plan, that it is said to be expected to foresee a total of around 300 million euros of investments by 2015.
It is said to provide better use of trains and the rail network under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The aim is to get rid of the platform until the start of service and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches during the four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the railways, Rüdiger Grube, warned of the awards after a summit meeting with government and industry leaders against train shortages and delays during this winter.
The passenger transport runway had considerable problems last winter, as it had a shortage of reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Rail Authority.
This is also the delay in the dispatch of ICE trains
The runway has also been unable to cope for years that the axles of ICE trains are probably more likely to be inspected by workshop when a one ICE train at Köln Central Station has been destructed by the removal of the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays $1 million fine in US
After the uproar over Chief Josef Ackermann, there are new trampings in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay millions in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not enough at home, the industry giant still caught up with his US past: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (€106 million) in a single-parallel process to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks in the course of the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage lists.
The financial market regulator NCUA blames a number of major banks for bringing in cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost considerable value in the course of the crisis, and tore the banks into the abyss with them.
"We are satisfied that we could have solved the subject without the need to be dragged to court by the parties," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank does not admit any of the culpability by the settlement.
This is also true for Citigroup, which is committed to paying 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the friendliness of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is competent for co-operative banks in the US and helps with bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the billions of dollars of damages incurred.
The settlement now completed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also became fixated on other Grand Bobsons and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
For dubious mortgage lists, this is the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around the properties in the morning. 2007 deflated, became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing at the banks' mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to reach redress or to suffer misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international grandstands of having disadvantaged two state-run US real estate executives, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit against FHFA, here there are more deals worth a total of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
By grading, the bureau demands that the Frankfurt Institute be responsible for "substantial losses" without, of course, making any exact amount available.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IBM IT-undercover company.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
The hitherto major American investor, Warren Buffett, has always claimed to be invested in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will be treated with difficulty in anticipation.
But he has now read the IBM business reports and has changed his opinion of investment in the industry.
Muflightly, he had to understand that IBM offered primarily services and acquires computer systems for the IT-unit of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is seen as knighthoods in the financial world.
As a result, it is allowed to call the mother's IT rock IBM now "Sir IBM."
For Buffett revealed on the US economics radio station CNBC that he had purchased $10.7 billion worth of shares from IBM since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised management, which tried even for proper returns in the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT-services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has rather avoided technology firms to date.
It claims to be invested only in undertakings whose activities they also understand.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, for the lubricant manufacturer, or for machine manufacturers.
In addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, his Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a wide range of Grand Halls such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old gentleman took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and built it with wise investments by one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money made brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (Miracle of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares rose by one percent before the stock market began.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered to be the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
But at Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to start.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be a friend of his intimate.
Threatening is palpable
After the discovery of the "Buna in Zwickau" the Turkish media have questioned the German rule of law.
The newspapers even speak of a "blooding ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small-time businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek one between 2000 and 2006 had a right-leaning extremist background.
This report was responded to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fears and worries.
For many German Turks, this brings back the spectre that has long been considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, was never in doubt.
But the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a range of scale, the dimensions of which can no longer be overseen.
"Does he revive the bloody ideology again?" reads the headlines in the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police officer to the constitution's protection agency, and they fear that the German authorities could also be embroiled in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded deliberately: It recalled over the weekend of the demonstration in silence in front of the Brandeburg Gate of victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the ceremonial act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
The coverage of several Turkish mediaes is a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the Fifties" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X" which reports on the back of the murder series.
The release of the "Hürriyet" for Germany will also not be taken away from making this intellectual connection.
"It's starting to smell," reads the headline of the post by Ahmet Külahci.
It underlines that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction were murdered.
Most criticically, the actions of the police and their late success in the search are discussed in the German-Turkish internet forums.
It had not occurred to the German authorities much earlier to search for the suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many are shown at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: 'If the activity is carried out so superficially, the immigrants will have no choice but their own defence and armed'.
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of the eloquence and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen."
What does it mean if internal peace in Germany is threatened is made clear by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burnt-out store in Solingen is deeply etched in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
But the assassinations made a more evident sense of reciprocity on the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, it was mainly criticized for the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in the Mölln survivors.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish state president, but was given his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, at a memorial service in Köln, for his speech, to be represented by his comments.
Quite as if a person's value is measured by the height of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how profound the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state-of-the-art arrangement is.
In addition to efforts to make extensive clarification and a new evaluation of right-right-lecomer-extreme terrorism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandalous bank at Zurich Lake
Europe's most adventurous bank is not established in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis, and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now a German is to compare it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think that.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank's leadership, he became known in July for a fresh new job in 2013,: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss Grand Brigade UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber was looking forward to it publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and called friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved a turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But by September, it was clear that things would turn out very differently.
An dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the board of directors of UBS has also been a scalded ever since - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not until 2013, as the Bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an issuer, and would certainly need a time to be incorporated.
It will then take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proved to deserve the title of "The Bank of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
For UBS is both huge - until recently, it was the world's largest property manager - and has been gobbling up for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, will not be left to the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also shrewd asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a point in investment banking.
So it managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world's biggest banks
That impressed you.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later longtime banking professor at Zurich, tells us: "I always introduced UBS to my students at the time as a model for a good bank."
"From today's perspective, one asks: How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the chief executive of the board resigned surprisingly, Peter Wuffli, who has so far been seen as a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, he was wondering why he had left.
The bank's investment division had squandered the Subprime-paper-and-paper and had to write back billions.
To stand it, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
On the other hand, it did find investors, but one that would have been the nose that would have been the previous time: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even learn its name.
But that was just the first bump.
In April 2008, it developed worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board of directors in 2006, resigned.
A disaster ensued in October 2008: UBS faced a fallout from a collapse, given its flawed investment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to make mandatory exchangeables for which it could become the bank's co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - noting how dramatic it was for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than that of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS one day," says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For months, UBS had capitulated to this in a tax dispute with America and had shown a willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, had been cut taxes.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from those deals, including a penalty surcharge.
This concluded that UBS more or less openly helped to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in a competition for wealthy clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was before.
This was followed by the resignation of the chief executive and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of the customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central commercial areas over the course of a few months: In investment banking, due to poor speculation and asset management to aiding and abetting tax cuts.
And just when things calmed down a bit again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered, this unfortunate trade anabase is coming up: A single dealer had mourned €1.7 billion before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: with the risk management in investment banking, it's probably still not working out.
"The Adoboli case has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finance professor at the Zürich University's Banking Institute.
The finance director of the big German bank is also sure: "The Problem of UBS is that it is not managing to control risks."
Yet it was exactly the idea of being cautious, with which the Swiss bankers had walked out a long time ago to become the watchmen of the world's great fortunes: no too much risk, but security for money - the Alpine Republic's world had also collapsed again on this side.
The vaults of the Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS Central in Zurich is still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are beautiful, with store rentals among the highest in Europe.
The jewellery store like Tiffany's is among the Swiss traditional shops as the Sprüngli confectionery.
It has been home to Swiss banks for centuries: from the Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The receptionist hall of UBS is entered through heavy revolving doors.
Inside are marble-lined walls, with massive leather chairs in front of them, a large rudder to the "sejf" alongside the bank's logo.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank of Switzerland, the two Swiss bigwigs, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - were repressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he concludes, like all Swiss bankers, with the two grandbanks also business.
UBS has probably gotten too big, it's finding out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about this.
"And if they had, they had adapted long ago to the Anglo-Saxon manners."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS had changed, had made high profits at first, and then a disaster: No European financial institute had lost as much money in the jungle around the Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
15. October 2008 the disaster was obvious.
"At that centre, the ruling coalition of a small 7-million-strong country has reached the line for the largest rescue effort in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or some 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to bail out the bankrupt bank of the grandstand.
How could this have happened?
If they talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks merged into a massive concern.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, it was helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS were complemented: One rich but sleepy bank in Curych, with its focus in wealth management and poorer but more internationally more heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up profitably with a lot of money that they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, UBS chief executive and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007.
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows a lot about the models and the statistics, and Ospel, the man guiding the feelings around his stomach that has developed from the banking science completely up."
But Ospel was said to be relying on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli was probably making a decisive mistake at the end: "He probably thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
What is clear is: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall the senior executive meetings at which Wuffli's Concern chief reiterated the same slogan again: to cut Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She listed "League Tables," a waiting list that documents the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to be placed at the very top.
A few steps were already successful.
In the foreign exchange and equity trade, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the business advisers in charge of stress one weakness: In the international interest rate trade, in the language of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a big distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS committed to an adventure that had almost cost her existence.
Hungry after the growth, the bank itself and its own-based fund to hedge risks in the U.S. investment of Subprime investments.
It sprawled in a massive machine that reproach the securities on U.S. mortgage loans and passed on - but it also retained its own risks.
Also, when the other banks were long looking for a way out.
"As late as the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says banking expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, the deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
The UBS positions have become a catapult seat and swing until today.
Whoever runs the Grand Broom now has an almost unmanaged job.
They must find a strategy for the bank that has disappeared all the close business models.
Bank expert Geiger already has the idea: the end of the investment banking business, the concentration on asset management, a return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is to be severely dined, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was, in fact, seen only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: He is to run UBS's business for a long time, the Zurich Bank told the Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on the situation in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats will be cut.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But he is still saying publicly only that he and his lady will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

This has skeptical the investors in the US. "We're not an island, we're addicted," said Goldman, a management member of Goldman.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
Investing legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC-Interview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe was quite strong to do everything to end the crisis.
That is why, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades-old principle and joined the American Technology Industry.

Intelligent crows are expanding in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be driven out of the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows have been in the city's image for centuries, yet in some municipalities the population's complaints are accumulating to the impurity and noise caused by the animals.
At the same time, there is no means of any remedy in sight against the "problem birds" yet.
The Havranno Fields may not be out of the cities, experts at the first sympathies said of the churches in East-Welin Leer.
There, experts from all over the Federal Territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Meanwhile, conservationists derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing development and the felling of typical trees to nest for the birds make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are, among others, in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in Berero.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killing crows in the country district triggered negative headlines.
Critics called the capture of animals in traps for birds and the killing of the sticks to be particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, scares, brings nothing," the urban planner and landscape painter Werner Klöver of Leer found so much.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg, also said.
"The animals retreat, the large colonies are split and divided into different places."
The screech is conceivable only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding areas, the problem of the cities cannot be solved, was the view of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Thinking is the combination of expelling animals from sensitive residential areas and germination to settle in other places.
"Information board instead of chain saws" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One need for the face is to be the best at ease with confidence after all."
Ms Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg educational course in Schleswig-Holstein, on which they provide information boards with lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been accepted by tourists in the meantime.
The criticism of the noise caused by the birds was also expressed by Ms Jürgens: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say."
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: Field Ravens use not only the aids to reach a treat, but even make their instrument as an aid.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the behavior of four field ravens as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring the stones to collapse the structure to reach the catter of the pier.
Without much training, they could tell the size and shape the stone had to take to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more precarious problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a tiny container with a catwalk larvae.
The beak could not have reached the birds on their prey.
But the researchers put bits of wire for them.
From them she shaped a hook to four animals, using as a bolt to hunt the container behind the handle.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do it even with a jam.

The goal was finally cleared up shortly before the conclusion.

While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost securely clear his place on the bench of the third time at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians are allowed to rejoice in their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championships.
In front of the 31,000 spectators at the Maksimire Stadium, the Turks should have a near-tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post with a long shot in the seventh minute, the striker Kazim also could not have hung the rebound in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took over but increasingly control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.

Konstantin Vassiliev (57) drew level for the visitors.

After a defender by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to a 1-0 lead.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
SAP, the largest software manufacturer in Europe, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
Do r. 2015 is said to be around $2 billion (approximately €1.5 billion), Dax told the group on Tuesday.
"We will create more research and development facilities and employ the relevant staff," acting chief executive Bill McDermott announced at the Beijing Customer Fair.
The staff is now set to rise from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of world number one branches in business software doubles from five to ten or eleven.
SAP is still present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's emotionous new new book, Beauty and Sorrow: The Beauty and the Sorrows: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of performant characters.
One piece of advice on how to act at that point: carefully rip this page out and make a bookmark of it.
In fact, you will get to know all persons very well in Mr. Englund's novel's narrative, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at times when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "anti-historical work."
It contains some very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, while it is almost missing ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as "a book about what it was like." It mainly deals with "quiets, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" combining the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the tangle of destiny, while others are smashed out.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It corrects the notion that the First World War was all about the horrific trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and grief" deftly explores other places where war dramas were taking place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve the problems with falling bee nests on them, have to spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids, or they are grappling with the presence of the tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it is a very moving read.
The war will engulf people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts to come forward in the distance and you are the woman who is at home with her children, run or do you stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why the war was started.
"The vacuum arose from a lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "concluded conjecture, conjecture, hopes, apprehensions, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors were filled."
"Beauty and grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly readings from biographies, letters and other already published material.
Descriptions of their lives may sound both terrifying and engaging, but the inclusion of small moments and details make them utterly vivid and believable.
Many of them are about hardship and dealing with it.
In the story of the German student, the author says: "Pursuits, all substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee surrogate, a mock aluminum imitation, a rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "aim of pressed rice made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a false wood bone), dried roots and dried potato skins, wooden-soled shoes.
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes for the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds the inner impulses of wilderness and brutality, then he declares to the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is the human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening paper or a good book, and pretend that this mask of yours is a civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind the starchy me inside."
In contrast, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone mourning.
"When one finally accepts the fact that one is sacrificed, one would at least expect to do so in the face of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a "doublewl he secretly hangs."
Other remarks relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition and a competitive fight," writes Mr Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captured what he calls "a new species of beast of the coming century: a eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress that makes his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, the meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the goncoccal pus that the soldiers bought and rubbed with their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate ones intramigated him into their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not spectacular, which is perfect for his human subject.
In dozens of small displays, he captures the way the war "disapults of utterly unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, the social revolution, the religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly, rather than a comprehensive narrative, worked with hints, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell, or novels such as "On the Western Front of Calm" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending unparalleled in popular educational literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
But you will feel as if suddenly the author had jumped out of the book, snatched the page from the heroes' list from your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake this time for a minute, a well-planned raid
Hundreds of police officers participated in it, some in the helmets used in the street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time the Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except a few senior officers. Others were first told that it was an exercise.
The event was headed by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
They were not allowed to repeat the cases of recent weeks, for example, when pepper spray was used against protesters, breaking the department's rules and, in addition, spilling over the squatters to the squatter's side.
That is why the police operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leadership officials were inspired by the operations conducted in other cities.
A massive exercise in case of behaviour in crisis situations took place in the section of Randalls Island, which was a preparation for the event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called training to curb riots - counterterrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders for the move to the park came literally "at the last minute" was stated by someone to whom the event was originally explained only as "training."
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and they were certainly not told that they are going to the Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on the condition that he remain anonymous.
"The fact that it is going to Zuccottti Park was the highest-ranking members of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already received once.
14. In October, city officials planned to clean the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they flocked hundreds of them to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's action was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to reinforce neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people came and went to the park, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when as few people as possible would be in the park," he said.
Before the troops set out, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, emergency trucks with arched lamps and amplifiers.
The lights and the recorded news roaring from the amplions terrified many of the demonstrators.
When members of the riot squad entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m. to give the demonstrators time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were spotted gathering on the outskirts of the park to enter if there were any arrests to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department Chief Caucus Secretary Paul J. Browne claimed that this was the case for their safety.
However, many journalists take the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and in addition to some police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could easily film.
Police moved in the west, weaving through the dense jumble of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. Behind them came the teams from the sanitation department, which immediately raked in everything that was left in the park.
Some of the demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting pictorial material appeared on the internet moments later.
A most staunch group of demonstrators took refuge in the vicinity of the kitchen in their campus, which lay near the center of the park.
Some set up a roadblock and police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people at the center of the campcuff were handcuffed to each other.
And two people tied up to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m. in the park, Mr. Kelly reported.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police commented.
Mr. Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were made because of "an organisation of riots and the opposition of arrests," he clarified.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of police, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the detective's chief of staff.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "didn't participate in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called in.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and a roadblock for Pine Street, a block south of the park, were set up.
From these locations, the police then developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
Police officers were spotted at one of the sites, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they push people even further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a demonstrator was spotted, south of Pine Street, jumping onto the hood of the police car and several others who were blowing air out of the tires of the police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the surgery, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Auxiliary workers' union to sue city for release
Unions representing hundreds of school-aid workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. He argues that the redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, it was discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on the schools attended by poor students.
The lawsuit is likely to be the last resort left by the Greenrators in District Council in their efforts to overturn the redundancy decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators, and other staff who were among the city's worst-paid staffers lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by union leaders as retribution to the city for not allowing him access to a health care fund managed by work crews last spring, using which the city wanted to put a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a meeting of the city council held last month, said Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott, that the redundancies were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered that the budget was not specifically mentioned in the budget for the dismissal of the auxiliary staff.
Representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Education Ministry that they would sue him. They will call a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff will be the plaintiffing to be the dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as will most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and would therefore not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by the New York Times, the unions targeted at the number of redundancies in the poor parts of the city, thus seeking to support their claims of unfair conduct. They take the view that the poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funds for the long term.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island section of the Staten Island did not release at all, and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, part of District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost, and even 46 assistants were fired in parts of District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He recalls that at Harlem's Public School 36 lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: 'This is not a neighbourhood of full of movable parents who can procure funds to balance the deficit in the budget.'
The budget of the Public School 36 school was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the city was to calculate bonus funding for each of the loser students enrolled.
The unions argue, among other things, that the headmasters of secondary schools may have been confused in the manner in which the document approving the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
The "excess" was used to describe the action in describing the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose salaries are paid for by the central authority.
"Abandanix six parental coordinators have been fired," reads the complaint's draft, "and not merely moved to the database in the position of available personnel."
Mission over, Congress ready to accept deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats in the Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on the comments supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thanking the American troops for their "brass."
"With this statement, we want to applaud the courage of the people of Libya who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences in question may look innocent, but no debate involving Libya has been an easy time until now.
During the summer, lawmakers from both sides kept arguing with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of statements for approval or, conversely, a rejection of the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of the different views of the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would stop funding for US operations in Libya.
This rendered the US mission in Libya literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama runs the mission, but it clearly did not irritate his members so much to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitation of the congress was finally overtaken by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli and 20 in August. on October, Gaddafi was killed.
The Nato mission officially ended on 31. October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Committee "congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity they have made in an attempt to free their people" and "wage the men and women of the United States' armed forces, as well as their allies, who have joined the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States at the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be split in two halves, as was the case with the June proposal?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief representative on the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
There will be a vote in the House this week on the amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the Budget or Other Topic, which will be voted on by the entire House or the Senate.
So far, despite considerable efforts, other lawmakers have yet to push their proposals to the vote itself.
The Goodlatt proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were presented in the Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal to both the House and the Senate - and others were just minor variations by others.
In the House alone, at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful can be found to "regulate federal spending."
Some of the proposals are the same, but their proponents - especially novst hourly Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority."
The revenue for budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the balance budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the number of periods for members of the congress to serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.), wants to increase the number of periods that may be president in office.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a number of addenda that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an amendment banning the marriage of same-sex couples, as well as an amendment banning the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws in the event that two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in proposing various additions, they are not significantly out of the average compared to previous years.
111. Congress offered 77 additions, while in the 100. Congress was 66.
Their activity even pales compared to the early 1990s, when members offered more than 150 additions every two years, according to Senate library statistics.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last supplement, which was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Funned, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was injured at point-blank range by a gunman in a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with a feature-track melody from the Broadcast "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted more than a return to Congress to recover.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. You could see that the making of sentences still caused her trouble and she needed help as she walked.
The entire show documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary for a bullet injury that punched her skull in the front, penetrated her left half of her brain, and out of her head at the back.
Surprisingly, she returned to the House three months ago to triumphantly take part in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Giffords, 41, responded, "Pretty well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the one-hour special of the "20/20" episode, which aired on the eve of the new book of this couple's "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special watched the entire convalescence of Gifford since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos shot by Kelly in his first week, you can see Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband cheers her, she can't do any more than just raise one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and the therapists are taught how to perform simple activities.
The nod of the head.
Pissing the lips.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords had spoken another word - "toast" as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman sings on them along with the the therapist for the melody for the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, she told Sawyer that she had no recollection of the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said he didn't read to Gifford newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
The shooting is suspected of the shooting, Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held at the Missoury prison, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of forensic medication.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, horrible, horrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife said during her recovery, "I lost."
"So I said to her at once, "Gabby, you haven't lost," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you'll make it, pull yourself together, and come back even stronger than ever."
Military troops encounter compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, and marines ran around him.
The solemnly dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring benefit.
The gala evening was attended by the then chairman of the committee of the chief of staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was in place, but he saw the role of the military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was pity.
Such the opposite impressions only illustrate the daunting relationship between the military and the often aloof, sometimes celebrated by the American public.
The military is boundless by commendation for its victims.
But this praise comes at a cost, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We're not the victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But the only way in which some of them can support us seem to be to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for army commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to spoil the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops returning from Vietnam had to face was far worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are uttered in silence and in private among war veterans.
As the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat actions to serve as Marine Corps members, their father warned them that their service would be viewed by people outside the military from two angles.
Some will feel respect and astonished, as they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will be wondering if "an evil, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took his place in Washington in government upon his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people interviewed interviewed him subtly suggested that he could withstand the stress associated with the work in Washington so soon as he returned to the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to reckon with negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military's concern stems in part from American indifference to the wars.
Successes on the battlefield rarely get a recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little of its own benefit to its own.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as we were common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition from politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are honoured for the number of actions they endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, it will be decided whether the trial of 28 women and men against the military will be initiated for alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to sue.
The first-class female Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old at the night of her army colleague being allegedly raped by her colleague at the 11th week of her pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at the Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they might have a little drink in her room.
"My warning light came on in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listen to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her onto the bed and raped her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the military will be awaiting the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The accused states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which is in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The charges were filed by Washington lawyer Susan Burke in February, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. Over the coming months, however, their numbers grew to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military, after announcing these sphrases, failed to investigate, punish, and any pursuit of justice.
Burke says she's at the throats of the military's top-ranking commanders, because the problem starts with them.
"The array is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in the position to stop efforts to introduce measures against such acts? The High Command.'
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the charges into this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, as she puts it - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if the pressure needs to not abate.
The team defending the Ministry of Defence is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has initiated the case to be dismissed.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - essentially, the point of filing cannot sue the military for the wounds they have sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine in 1950, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by active-droned soldiers.
"The alleged injuries concern the military service of the plaintiffs," the document reads.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is just a matter of vocabulary: it is difficult to find a clearly-based frontline in modern wars.
In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers were killed between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
It is time for the military to be upgraded, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight. In addition to her, the case is being handled by three other attorneys.
At the Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran's legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for the allegedly developing an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
Independently of this, the nonprofit organization of American Vietnam veterans is gathering the groundwork for its lawsuit targeting the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of a "personal disorder" allegedly found in rape victims to give the military an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights activists Service Women's Action Network, it is a perfectly normal practice.
Her group had already filed a motion for a lawsuit against a State Veterans Organisation in December, accusing of discriminatory practices that were to be carried out in the processing of requests for assistance by those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and members from both political parties and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Preventing and Paralizing Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unannounced in most cases, and according to Pentagon's own estimates, this figure is equivalent to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also analyzes the level of prosecution of the suspects: In 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the military - half of the civilian justice system - were taken to court.
Prosecutors in the Burke representative's case describe the attacks only as the first of a number of traumas.
First-grade Private Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to take place.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she had done on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing during which questions were asked about whether she had been in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned, as witnesses to the reputation, in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was passed," Lyman says.
"I felt I'd give birth right there on the spot - I ran out of the courtroom screaming.'
"I was placed on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer: That wasn't his trial. He was mine."
The Lymanians ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her ineligible for duty.
In January 2010, she was dismissed from the army without honour and therefore without the right to the pension.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors move to the next stage or not, it's a long shot, says John Turley, George Washington Law Law Professor.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the deliberations."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the doctrine in question, which has been criticised since the first moment of seeing the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is behind for several decades because their duties do not give the same degree of motivation incentives and deterrent deterrents.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
There will only be a change if the good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkeva, the plaintiff's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other people ready to sue and begin work on further cases on the subject.
"We will not continue to fight the military with this issue for the reason for the reform from which there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, from what comes first.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man to present his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the murderous fury in July, left of 77 people in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the attack's preparations, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on the social networking site.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them isn't really that hard at all," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent British research team report on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, Bartlett says that scientists were simply enough to simply use the ad on the site to determine the search demographic group with complete accuracy - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, then focused their attention on them and sent out the ads. However, instead of inviting them through them to the newly formed group or offered them some dietary products, they called on them to fill in a questionnaire that raised questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence and optimism, given their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without even leaving the office.
"This is a whole new way of conducting research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are all young men who are irritated by the growing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, democratic, and less violent than those who remain hidden behind a computer screen all the time."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding in state updates, contributions to the walls and the clapped by the "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data a day on average, which makes this social network a literal "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers in whose name the word Facebook is found rose to nearly 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey of the British National Party people, it was very hard to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the party you'd never be allowed to go to," says Bartlett.
"All of this is being demolished by Facebook - you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drunkenays on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than the students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' peers monitor the site and come forward with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for the Health, Conduct, Conduct, and Children's Children's Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We've found a way to identify children at risk who we wouldn't have a chance to discover."
Facebook itself is constantly probing the data of its users.
The site's information team has produced statistics on the link between the relationship statuses and the day of St. Valentine's Day, 2010 turnout and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available to others for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is being watched, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to give the page your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users thought that scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study he conducted using the public facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it to mean that there was only information between them and their friends."
It is then also considered the question of the methodology.
Even in the off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to verify in any way how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technology, thinks that a pencil and a notebook remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
"When you go out to the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhabitable": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who has pleaded guilty to ploting two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "deliberate" fighter during his first public judicial hearing in Oslo.
"I am the military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Knights of Templar," he said in court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you were given a mandate by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I do not admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use the hearing as a stage from which he could espouse his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a prepared speech, to allow relatives of his victims to address at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for the next 12 weeks, banned him from contacting the media for 4cturances, and announced that the final authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look the Breiviks in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly locked up.
They all took part to move the case to an early conclusion.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told NRK.
"It wasn't pleasant, but for my part, I can say that after I saw and heard the suspect, I'd mentally moved on a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. Upon entering and leaving for the building, without difficulty, viewed the journalists present, and the surviving, to the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of the larger "resistance" movement, the judge found that he was not mad, noting that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
It may be a consolation to some that the 22nd attacks. June seems to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
"I wish she'd look like a monster, but he's not," a relative of one of the victims said.
"If I did, things would be a lot easier."
7 lessons learned from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to cinemas this week
Once Steve Jobs 5. He died in October, the opinions of the people who compared him to Henry Ford - and elected him as his genius The greatest modern inventor.
At the recently re-elected Jobs interview, which was debased for a special film that is heading to cinemas this week, the fact will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and work flows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who matches every little thing in the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a truly great idea is 90 per cent of their work... [but] there is still a long journey of mourning work between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During filming, a unique, more than one-hour interview took place.
By this time it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and was eager to see how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the end, only a short portion of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were told that they had been lost in the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs's death, however, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, there is a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking as to how the answer is how to see Jobs think of the answer perfectly, to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism surfaces, when Cringely's questions seem impatient and prophesies him to get more important issues and topics.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and it features terrifyingly prophetic ideas when Jobs assess what other companies do well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to read through the posthumous reviews of Jobs's career, but there is something raw and inspirational about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
Here he has his own vision of what they might and should look like.
It didn't take long for him, and after he uttered his thoughts, he also began putting them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run the business:
"During the years of the business, I always asked: Why do you do this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks about business-related things in the deep.
I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the cost was recorded - often starting with the "standard cost" sign, the amount of which he could only be imagined. At that point, he decided to go his own way - developing an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the commercial costs in a moment.
How he made the rascal to the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he had built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack into the phone company effectively and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number of the devices have been written about this in the past, but Jobs's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally infectious.
It tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and were switched from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've traveled around the world at least half a dozen times like this, so when we yelled something into a paid phone, it came in from the second phone at the door a minute later," laughs Jobs.
"We were young, and we found that we could build a thing ourselves that is capable of managing infrastructure worth billions of dollars around the world."
Two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would have been created without it.
Jobs continues with the description of the prank he and Wozniak have almost completed. They called the Vatican to the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, asking if they could speak to the Pope, posing as best as they did as they could.
Gradually, the more and more senior members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was only just before the Pope himself rousing the phone that the pair burst out and put the earpiece down.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a vibrant, he found the number on Bill Hewlett in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a secure summer job at the Hewlett-Packard company.
"She influenced me incredibly. It was the only company I'd met at the time, and it was shaping my view of what a company it was and how it was supposed to treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research lab at Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was the size of a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I moved up and up at HP, hanging around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How to invent innovations:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he devises new products on the fly.
In the early days of his career, when he set out to sell a few straight-line records, a customer asked him to build a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which time he had to devise, assemble, and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember when we argued quite wildly . . . they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost USD 300], until I got tired of it, I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are running out of breath:
A long time before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs foresawfully predicted that many industrial leaders would falter in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you do better copiers or printers, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company could no longer be more successful.
At that moment, sales and marketing are in charge, so the companies are headed by the people in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technology genius who led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times the size of it, it could have been Microsoft's nineties...
Instead of winning, however, they set up a loss.
How he sees innovation as a form of art:
"There's still a long way to go and work between the excellent idea and the excellent final product... and as the great idea develops, it's changing and growing."
During that time, you learn a lot about him.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - certain things you just can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things at all times - different concepts - and compose them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a certain way, you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The Macintosh Society was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were brilliant musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they'd do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Health Care Act at the time of their case before the court
The day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to hear the politically controversial question of whether it would accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that would attend the court hearing.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submissions.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the suit. But a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, with the outcome further stirring up the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will face the court and will seek to refrain from the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society group, which has been involved in defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenging the law, the so-called National Independent Business Federation.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner took place at the Washington hotel hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the Senate's Republican leader and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the listing of the guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: These pair of judges have been attending the Federalist Society's events for years.
Nor is it anything that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to comply with the conduct principles to which junior federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge can participate in the events that are currently being held by the related and other organisations to obtain funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be given on the agenda of the event."
Still, Scalia and Thomas's relationship with the two law firms performing in the case, as well as to the company with the huge financial interest in the case, was more than enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contradicting the claim by several judges that the Supreme Court is behaving under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined at the social benefit, together with the legal representatives awaiting the case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermine the legs with all claims of detachment, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy to their critics, telling them that they also combined their legal duties with actions such as the Federalist Society without any problems.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem lies mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Prosecutor General under President Obama when the first objections to the law emerged in court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she was fighting so much for the law at the time than she could be unbiased now.
Kagan gave no indication that she was about to resign.
Boeing wins record-breaking deal for $18 billion for jet aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 two-cylinder Boeing 777 jurle, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is the company, and the cost of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it's a different story.
Equally important news is where Boeing received the contract: the Middle East, a growing goldmine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the airline in the Middle East will need 2,520 $450 billion worth of aircraft over the next 20 years.
At the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-wheeler-loving Boeing 777 kicks.
The sensation contract came from the Emirates airline, based in Dubai.
Boeing told the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline had the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, which would allow the total value of the contract to rise to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes also called a Dreamliner, which boasted significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole of Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the country's oil-producing nations.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the increase in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to the airline, because it is one of its largest costs - is not so decisive, because the country alone is making money from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as with other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders to increase fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he says.
The contract from the Emirates airline consolidates Boeaing's leading position in the market for broad-freel aircraft and is bringing to the hut by Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to break Boeing's dominance with its transport model A350.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be postponed to the first flight.
The relegation was due to the fact that customers demanded a greater utility load on the aircraft and range, so the manufacturer took time to give the machine more engine power.
The cost of Boeing Co's events rose by 1.5% to $67.99.
The Mexican president's sister is believed to have been defeated in the Michani elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto's PRI, was helped by drug traffickers in pursuit of the governor's chair.
Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost in the violent state election for the governor's post in Michoacán. On Monday, she subsequently said that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were attributed by the leadership in the Western State's governorship election to Fausto Vallej of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The encroachment of organized crime members into the entire electoral process, and especially into the course of the elections themselves, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview with the radio the day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the polling group... They confiscated the ballot box, built roadblocks... and let people vote to order for PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency.
But he plans to return to power soon, and winning the election in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI Party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Calderon, who was still leading the day before the election.
Calderon, the Conservative candidate for her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governorship. For the fractious and unlucky persecuted party, it is a very unfortunate loss ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state under Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to be recognized for the results.
Michoacán was long controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamfetamines.
This is President Calderon's native state of birth, and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated only a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However the results of the election in Michoacán look like it for the PRI party, the victory will help the party gain a new boost.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington, congratulated Vallej and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging, given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help rescue the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the Manila-based ADB Bank, said that the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the monetary bloc's rapid recovery through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] group were following all European difficulties "too dispassionately" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership, would help to drive down the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So it suits anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been hard-pressed to be tried for months by a major debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns about being dragged back into recession for the global economy, and calls have begun to emerge to bring new booming upringing front-run economies to help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag had predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that the two-sided assistance - such as the purchase of the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, the institution for European financial stability, to the European financial stability - would give the Asian partners European countries more negotiating opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying out of foreign capital tributary.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We stand a tough task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"This is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India's, have no business to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain the help for Europe to the 1.2 billion people of India, with 800 million of which live on $2 or less per day.
"Someday they might find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would be difficult to explain," he noted.
Similarly, Lee Howell, CEO of the World Economic Forum, questioned why India's stock should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis was imminent with a "dangerous domino effect."
The bank's forecast to have 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 is now facing a 'risk of decline' because of the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must develop "unpredictable spending plans" to be protected from decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Calls from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
In Congress, Defense Minister Leon Panetta gave a good foothold under the boiler in Congress on Monday, warning that looming auto cuts in the budget could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting with the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next decade, but it now fears a reduction of an additional $600 billion if Congress fails to conclude an spending deal.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," the Panetta wrote in a letter to senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this indiscreet way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipbuilding projects - you can't just buy three-quarters of a building or a ship. In addition, further impaired further modernization efforts could be seriously damaged," the Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and as the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on a forced holiday to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake up the faith of those who cared for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, the cuts will also affect the combat units, the Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this subsidence, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," the Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts to the contractors, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war efforts of our people."
"The stocks of paid staff will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and subsequent breaches of legal and political support."
Both Senators had written off to the Panetts ten days ago and asked for details regarding the potential effects on the Department of Defense's auto-scarring.
"The consequences of the Ministry of Defence's show could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released the Panetto letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign off on it."
"The cutbacks planned are a threat to the United States' national security, which we should not allow."
"Only will we see if the Panetta letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress to the approval of the budget and increase the votes calling to omit the Pentagon from the list of cut-down areas.
The Panetta has been increasingly open in interviews in conversations about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was in a tough fight.
At a press conference held in the week of the week of defense, the Defence Minister hinted at a brief picture of what his resort might be waiting for - the army's shell, but inside which the core would be missing.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be a brigade without ammo."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of the Pentagon speech.
"She will be like a forceless unit without morality, unprepared and incapable of evensighting to a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the annex, provided with the letter to McCain and Graham, the Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibilities of drops and deployments around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, the Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to be terminated, including those already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included the F35 project, the planned new bomber, the new-generation balm submarine, the new coastal combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle to replace the Humvee with.
By halting further development and testing of the F35, it would save USD 80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military that needs to be dealt with by the country's potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glimpse of recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and deceitfulness in everyday life are.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both parties claiming that the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury in trying to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught calling US President Barrack Obama with a downed microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to ruin the entire career and shake the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and online exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he released information that was immediately refuted by unquestioned evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using the funds of his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that swept past Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories everywhere about cheating at school and at the university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test responses just to make their own thoughts look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send a message that a lie and a scam are acceptable.
How many cheats do we encounter?
Studies show that on a single day, you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let's assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in their first minutes of their first meeting in their lives.
Determining lies, or "recognition of lies," is a necessary skill that should be adopted by everyone, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar to, shall we say, Sharad, when one shouts, "I have you." The recognition of deception is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected during the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about the lie have been debunked.
Liars are looking into your eyes.
It's not like they're stumbling, stuttering, blushing or fidgeting.
However, don't infer from the fact that it is somehow difficult to spot and detect liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are made and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and evolving lie-recognition industry, and it is clear that exposing deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your work duties include hiring, holding interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in alertness, directing their emotions and intuitively realizing how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men uttering more "self-centred" lies, while women call more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say tend to be "inspent").
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's normal behaviour.
It's called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding out with what to compare with.
Notice the subject's posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is routinely tapping your legs all the time so you don't improperly accuse him of lying just because he starts tapping with his foot in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But take this only as warning signals, not as evidence of a lie.
People telling the lie can stop moving the upper body when they try to remember their imaginary story, can film the toes of their shoes to the door, roar to the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "reliven after the interview" - an exaggerated relieved sigh and a change of position when confinement is difficult to confine after them.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, only to see what the relief will look like after it ends.
Also feel the subject's language.
What is famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once missed and used the previous time, claiming that his murdered woman was alive, which ran a nationwide search for her body.
Plainty individuals can also be aloftened token: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or the difficult question will be repeated.
The most common verbal features are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "simmingling language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
We don't learn much about the facts in that answer, and it's often another warning sign.
There is no spell to reveal any lie, but it is possible to master the skills by which the lie can be reckoned.
With these skills, one will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a con man to fall for one in his personal and work.
The controversial plan to build the oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of a delay in US government approval emerged
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - setting the unions against each other, but reassuring the environmentalists - a company building a pipeline to announce that it was willing to redirect the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the pipeline's planned route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still be approved.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebrask government.
TransCanada's Steps of Alex Pourbax argues that the company is confident that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it will run a different route.
This announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was postponing a decision on the federal permit of the project, from which it would not carry out studies of possible alternate routes that would allow it to be unaffected in the Sandhills region of Nebraska and the waterproofing layer of Ogallala, the sprawling water supply.
"This is really a move forward," Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental report commissioned by the Foreign Ministry would likely push back any decision until 2013, a year after next year's elections, but the authorities are denying that a policy would play any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile-long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the Refinery in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow through him every day.
This path will need to be crossed by 6 states.
This project is utterly hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the work crews, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when they work on the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed the plan, considering introducing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the waterproof Ogallal layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An ongoing study on the environmental impact commissioned by the Foreign Ministry found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but a source in the energy industry said the inspector general from the ministry had commissioned a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
It was once that the lobbyist hired to TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, was not in the program of a conflict of interest.
Another, whether the firm that was hired for the original study was chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of puckoring toddler in fear
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle raided the lobby of their Manhattan house furiously and scared their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The climb of the "Lady Marmalade" singer frightened the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "involving personality, sleep disorder" and "an increased fear of strangers," her family says in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk and her luggage came down to the vestibule of their home in the Riverside Boulevard section, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I left to pick it up"
LaBelle rebuked the pregnant woman in an exasperated manner.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,"" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion.""
She became enraged and began to speak dirty - shouting loudly the gimmic expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her and started spraying water on me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter."" said the child's mother.
LaBelle lunged at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to be stopped by her entourage, who subsequently dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
The daughter, meanwhile, was screaming so much as she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no reply.
Lawyer and spokesperson for the singer LaBelle's is not responding to our phone calls to comment on the entire case.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case up for free and that the family planned to donate all the extracted money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if he is directed at the school teacher holding an 18-month-old baby in the arms of an eighteen-month-old."
Climate's incursion hinders the economy
During the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined, and with them the economy
2011 will be written into the economic history of Sinaloo. This is the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdez, which itself calls itself the government of change. This government has brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the start of the year, no growth was observed and even the main indicators of economic development have fallen.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, curtailed the growth opportunities for the state economy, responsible for reducing economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historic 31.16% decline, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors as well.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Sustainable Rural Development Council, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and partial damage was found for the remaining 21.07%. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and pea.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistical and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increase in the first three quarters. Between January and March, the U.S.S.55,033 people were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. Unemployment rose to 5.28% in the second quarter, and between July and August, average unemployment rose further to reach 6.19%, representing around 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed people has thus increased by 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa is due to multiple factors. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the rise of unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is linked to various factors. These include, but is, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to the reduction of resources due to legislation passed by a Congress in the context of the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who illegally seize the dollars to earn them, invest them or use them for something," he pointed out.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said the demographic factor was also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going to work abroad to the United States has been reduced, both for reasons of difficult entry and then also because of the fact that even if these people cross the country, it is hard for them to get jobs. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
Indenuisability
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is also deteriorating due to the increasing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistical and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Unemployment and unreliability are added to other features of the labour market, such as low pay. In this administrative territory are the lowest salaries in the country, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour Secretariat and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa working state was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average, which is at 7,375 pesetas.
Shortening foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, the most significant drop in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, between January and June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697 in the period from January to June, a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to services businesses.
Dollo
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government asked the state's state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revitalise the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. By November, no debt gains had been recorded, in any sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to business sector representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed out the lack of management capabilities of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of the Transforming Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of aligning the will of the individual sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was very tiny during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. We need to redouble our efforts in 2012, lacking harmonisation of the efforts of all of us, and in particular the right and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
The Grearity of the Economy
Loredo López said that the frosts at the start of the year halted the state economy and curtape its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was a slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to re-establish momentum that would allow an acceptable level of movement for processes, products and services to be achieved. That is why we were well below the expected forecasts at the end of the year," he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state must be pushed into more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally, we observe that work is being done. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has has" is mobilised, he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future to better guide the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, with some progress being made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said the current administration had shown progress in public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be amiable. I can say that the work done is to see here and I believe that the Government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela's Sandoval. He was convicted of the offence of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela's Sandoval was detained by the branches of the Mexican Army on 7 days. June 2010 on an errand in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 8 in the El Castillo district, Navolato.
The dealer was in a pick up white-coloured pick-up van. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and a small backpack in the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detached man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Unit and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of Legal Impacts of the Criminalies.
Waits contributions to the projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Hábitat, Rescuing Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants, face the risk of not being brought forward to the end or of being in a major delay due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has moved forward until now, the government is now in danger of failing to provide the state with appropriate supplies that require funds of more than 11 million peso for three programmes.
He said the total investment in the three programmes was almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have delivered the resources for the work, so it is possible that the implementation of the projects will be delayed.
"They're supposed to be able to secure almost 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we've never gotten anything at all. This is despite the fact that we should have received part of it in July," he said. "To keep us wasting no time, we have started the projects and are progressing very successfully, but we lack the money'.
He said that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar, Padilla, the state did not comply with the respective deliveries, so at the start of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay for more than 7 million not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to raise funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the promise from state officials regarding the transfer of these sources, he said that a request from Armandu Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and the Finances had been sent to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentages to arrive as soon as possible.
"They were to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet."
The Court of Justice approves the 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogic signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidium Decree, which wants to expedite the so-called "sending out of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He noted that the necessary eight votes had not been found to invalidate him.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree setting out the steps that would lead to the transition to Earth's digital television.
With that result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of the eight votes needed to enable the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, which thus remains valid, was not reached.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero puts forward the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, as the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the proposal also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not endorse the arguments of the proposal to the effect that the federal executive could not structure measures through the general standards of the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
"I do not think that even if it did, it would offend the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecoms sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The digital analogue signal replacement is one of the biggest changes experienced by the world in recent years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying the change would be to delay the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions on the public interest. Digitisation has not only a technical dimension, but "says also economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these questions "require to operate the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the state's economic direction. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts with the Government of the State."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had at their disposal the highly specialised technical bodies.
He said it was not possible for the government, by issuing a disapproving decree that to some extent interfere with the congressional powers, to introduce compliance with the laws prepared by the legislative power in the administration.
In Michoacán analyse the possibility of "voice after voice"
According to the PREP's published data, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The "vote" vote counted appeared in this year's Michoacán election, where, in line with the data published by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been included by the votes of 879 of the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the chairwoman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body had approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. In fact, the State Congress passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was to expire in that parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel neglected to release them within the deadline set within the statutory Law of the State Gazette, saying he had any objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote in the matter of constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "or approve or veto them."
Asked by the possibility of "voice-after-voice" census, María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council would make it possible for the local electoral body to carry out both the partial and overall census.
In this way, a partial vote-down, one or more electoral parcels, can be performed on the following terms: the election results do not match; there is no record of the counting of the votes and calculation in the relevant box, or the President does not have it available; or if errors have been made and obvious breaches of the election results.
In addition, the total recount of the votes in all ballot boxes will be made if there is an indication that the difference between the potential election winner and the second-place candidate is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever the explicit request by the representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place appears at the start of the session.
A total recount can also be made when, after being properly counted, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate came in second place. In this case, the election parcels for which a partial census has been made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between first and second place is less than 0.16%, even though 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His will of his will
His ashes will be scattered in the Nubalinamy Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported to Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night. During Monday, there will be a ceremony and a memorial service.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish that his ashes would be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honours, along with the other individuals who died in the accident, the family, Bacio Cortése, returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard a Mexican air force plane. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza avenue, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., the farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former classmates from the Technology High School and members of the American Football Team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla, and his wish was to be scattered in the mountains of the Nouleman. He always told his family and friends this way," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of his life, "he was a wonderful man, a special father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire flight school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, however he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "as he hardly came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as he did when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked best in his life: the flight control.
They said goodbye to him the last
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, the lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honours that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both his studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after a helicopter he was flying crashed. Also on board was the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of Solford native Bacio Cortés (clipped) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, to the area, where, meanwhile, the family, his daughter Amanda, and wife Cristina, the mother, siblings, and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies found at Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who had been detained in this area for offences related to organised crime.
The bodies of the three men murdered in various body parts and head were found at the deserted farmhouse of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery occurred on the 1.5-kilometre road from Cadereyt to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the hut with the beige-cock-wave fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked in, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow-coloured sports T-shirt and dark cotton trousers and was not wearing shoes. Next to it, you also lay in a white-strike sports T-shirt.
A few yards away, the body was another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton trousers.
The three of them lay facing the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered in another location because the bullets were not found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a series of bullet marks, both on the building and on the doors.
Cadereyt arrested 11 suspects
The secretary of the National Defense introduced 11 people, including juveniles who were members of a criminal group she operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information released during the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one detained person was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
The next raid took place on 12 November at 6pm. Military staff were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when he spotted a car without a license plateau and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they inspected and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained at about 14:00 on 13 November. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to run.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government to be appointed on Wednesday
Prime Minister Mario Monti, the appointed Prime Minister, will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government facing the crisis that holds the country's gait of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government facing the crisis that holds the country's gulf of economic disasters and which has put the eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks he had with the political parties in an attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The box is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has brought debt levels to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Mities, must approve a harsh austerity package required by European leaders. Only in this way will it be possible to restore Italy's wrecked credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry up. Due to the instability of the markets, the interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity of the 7 percentage exceeded the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Mids: 'We said we would support this government very much'.
We believe that this government is the last resort to get Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes for success were significantly appreciated thanks to support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign by the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, the center-right party's secretary, told reporters.
The support for the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because, until now, many of its members have opposed a technocratic majority-computer government.
Parliament support
Monti's new government must have the strong support of parliament to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added to the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The round of negotiations will close on Tuesday night.
Monti was named President Napolitano on Sunday, who made it possible to advance very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief drop at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates have returned to the critical threshold, responding to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt is €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the capabilities of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti said that his government should last in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians would only give him time to implement reforms and then call an early election.
Monti said he would like to integrate politicians into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that the government must be made up of experts to take Italy out of the predicament that the country has come to because of the financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual distrust and disapproval between the parties were complicated by attempting to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will exceed the threshold of 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players called up to the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica if we compare the 22 players from the two countries who met today for a 3:05 p.m. friendly at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA's one monthly rating, have a wide range of intermingling A-class A-class intermingling matches, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to play 50 international matches.
He reached that figure in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium last Friday.
The Spanish footballers, who play in the Stars' Match and the powerful English First League clubs, have maintained their intense activity at the league championships and domestic cups and high-level European Cup matches for over a year.
We must also add to the previous one the experience from the national Spanish team in the complicated knockout matches at the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team is to be played by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (a 0-1 loss to London) were tied for former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also play against Costa Rica today, earning a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player for Barcelona, has 106 games to his name.
Indeed, last week, Casillas and Xavi were officially announced to UEFA, along with other Spanish players with a hundred matches to their name. Among them, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol also approached the 100 with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, left winger Júnior Díaz moves with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with the 45th.
There were only 5 tops the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games, it's Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with the 23rd.
The rest was not exceeded by 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Víctor Bolívar has only one, and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet has included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
"The trip to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band was ready to offer one of the best gigs at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity for them to play in Costa Rica represents a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week, said.
The group is on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
This day will be performed at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the angel band The X and the national musicians of Las Robertas.
This is a sample from the interview, the entire transcript of which can be found on the website of La Nación on the internet.
For your Costa Rican supporters, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America, we've barely been the second and experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on holiday. It's a beautiful country, and I believe we can stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your most terrible supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that give you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have been made within a few weeks.
We have put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
In fact, we're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like to enjoy the jungles. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go to surf in Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best surfing spots. And so we found out about Costa Rica, through people who love to surf.
If you look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan to present in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limitations on what we can't do.
We will try to put on the best show with a variety of tracks. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What for?
I think in part it's because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 tracks and everyone likes different tracks, so it's hard to choose what songs we'll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that maybe we've forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, which is why I think it is more interesting for the people as well.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I think that none of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years. Sounds like a dream.
We realise how much we have been given and are touched by the fact that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and like making music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we've always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honour for us to be a part of this group in which the great greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
A group will be formed from time to time in the city, but it is far less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at once.
We are proud of this and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we went to the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate to be all our friends and we are honoured to be part of this movement that was formed in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we are all fortunate to be still in this world and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends, and as a result, we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone with sufficient freedom to experiment themselves.
We trust each other, we respect each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the balance?
The way we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too much on tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of the crowds and the people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for the music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you've given it. You mustn't get carried away by being famous, rock stars. This was never really of interest to either of us.
How do you remember another Mother Love Bone project?
I think we were writing great songs and it was something spectacular at the beginning.
As a band, we existed for three years and we never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most importantly, even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy, how unbelievable he was, how I laughed at him. It was always a joy to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person and we miss her.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the opening actuators?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs, and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas will offer live and they need to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he can think of.
Who is affecting you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
First up, I'm first thought of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them, I could talk all night about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to hold on to grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue?
I think we've all always felt a little separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is still this valid today, it's something great because it's the music that's worth listening to and the likes of Mudhoney players are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly grim character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very grim, although they may come off as positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital to give him tests for the muscle loss he has suffered in the lower limbs, his treating physician reported.
Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses by his government (1990-07) suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is already under control by doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Discral Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he is hurting and why he is losing strength in his lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that in his view Fujimori might be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, but the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and these problems were added by other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving a sentence since September 2007 at the National Headquarters of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people who were killed by a murdering squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the President of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businesses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting of meetings with policy leaders, commerce and representatives of the Uruguyas community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be used to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be removed from the international community. This statement drew a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been presiding over the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries. With the Latin American country, an agreement has been held from January this year on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretise fiscal exchange agreements to come out of the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries that have not established all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have been closed to the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has made the exchange of goods between the two countries strengthened.
Bearded plumbing runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, was made from the start to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use your glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy is supposed to work without glasses," said a press official specialized in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "Nintendo's first video game created specifically for this carrier" because, until now, successful films such as "Star Fox 64 33D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were the adaptations of the already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the image being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less skilled users.
Once you have surpassed this level, you can tackle the "second round" at the game's levels, which are more challenging this time around.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome all sorts of challenges and "not to undergo optical illusions."
This new entry of Super Mario in 3D is also expected to return the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous episodes. It is that the bearded man's plumber will have to go through dangerous minced platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds the news in the movements, in the surrounding area, in disguises and also among the enemies, there will also be a "playful" Luigi.
Colom approves extradition of Portallo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has taken steps to extradite former President Alfonso Portallo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a $70 million contention plot.
This is the end of the process aimed at giving Guatemala a reply to the request of the northern country requesting the extradition of Portillo to be able to try him.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he "does not interfere" with court decisions and allowed all extraditions that had reached his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin for the murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom's move marks a step in the execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and respect for human rights is guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty in the matter of embezzling $120 million at the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This trial was preceded by extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6000 young people in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education, not to find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organisation is very important: the 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. For 25 years, the organization has been helping them to overcome difficult situations.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremony that took place in the former manufacturing premises of the Fabra i Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, no job, struggling to addiction to drugs, or in a situation where they might fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Santa Andrea was attended by a large number of representatives of the organisations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the election, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
He and the president of the Generalitat, Arturo Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, attended the ceremony by a former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayors and current environmental-socialist councillor, Ricard Goma.
Both Fabra and Coats were attended by the current advisor for Social Well-Famous and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Social Works General Director at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created at a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to this day is "it is a good foundation."
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how to combat adverse circumstances and how to encourage people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organisation and for the work he is doing," he said.
There was the eviction of a busy house hosting gigantic parties
The helicopters appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without res falling back
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbours from Number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people left the building they had illegally inhabited and organized gigantic parties at noon yesterday. They left the building by court order and without the police having to intervene.
After the surgery, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From now on, the entrance will be watched," the caretaker said.
The occupiers who took over 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electric and partly the water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving the trash of all kinds, especially the cans of alcoholic beverages.
There were huge parties in the first three apartments that lasted for up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, the Balmes 51 which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales fell by 80% while the building was occupied.
The disco's owner emphasizes that the occupiers of the building made unfair competition for her because they sold drinks for €3, where the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment establishment had to respond to the neighbors' lawsuits for the noise. But the problems were not caused by the disco-keepers, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially those who attended the parties held here, the frequency and intensity of which had increased in recent weeks, according to the exaspoid residents of the neighborhood.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiven her rent for nine months.
The municipal police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the past few weeks about the situation.
Last week, the chairman of the city's CB's municipal group at the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, demanded that "the building be evicted immediately and end the civil cohabitation problems suffered by the neighbours and the destruction of the area."
The president of the Peoples explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in the last months the occupiers had reached all the floors of the building and into almost all the apartments, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against the civil liability that took place in the building."
Yesterday, the city's police department also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police reached Building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the proceedings, which entails more than controversy over the royalties
The city's 16-gateball selection process is once again opening up a debate about the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed out several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was accompanied by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After CMB was extinguished in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is one of the few that do not orient to the north-facing axis - the south, but up (down top).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of Yogi the bear.
This was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate plays more into the idea of a park.
Either this or someone's trying to place the gate in the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organisational and reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a subject as wiped as when two members of this old caste chosen to shake hands at the rendezvous in the elevator.
It was this feat that provoked one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and the coming university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process has its merit.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side has been written about, "it is necessary to" discuss the "Hountain Party," so Ildeonons Cerdo's speech about the green apples has not been finalised.
"We must start from the principle that the most extensive Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "game to Collserola" bears a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation of the zones where it is possible to operate."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers."
The danger resulting from the "uncertainty posed by the public place project today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had a "his swan singing" in the field of the Forum.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Same something is to take the next step," that is, in principle, to move one step further.
"It is necessary to bear in mind the new urban and planning instruments, because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) can cause a real scourge."
If we focus in more detail on the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley can be "considered a park" but the Barcelona part is not, for reasons of purely topographic.
Modol also recalled that there was already a work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola, which "shall not end up in the scrap heap," although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his board to intervene in the project from the "first moment."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity to the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "ponders" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about the skills" that needs to be created: 'Architects should only be tools'.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because the Collserola global visions are missing from the documentation for the competition: "There have been a launch of 16 tenders that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study looking at the area and to understand it as a whole".
This causes him, at least, to apply for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the one-gatee project may come up against the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the zone immediately located above Ronda de Dalt should provide for a full-length equipment zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens.
Casino pardons Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal commissioner, Cadino Red, p p p p p p p p p.m. granted the pile-up of Mayor Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after a legal commissioner, Casino Red, p p p p p pardon in that district, which was hearing an extortion case in which the mayor of Monterrey's brother was indicted.
After the Casino Royale assassination, Casina Red's owner, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás was to ask him to pay for an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Council to allow illegal operation at a betting home.
Following a public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution against the brother of the pan-tested mayor. On 2 September, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours in front of the Public Ministry's Agent No. 3 for property offences, he was transferred to Prison 1, stationed in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
He remained at this post for the following 49 days after a second imprisonment was issued and a Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19. He was taken to the Criminal Court in Cadereyt on suspicion of blackmailing Casino Red owners with a waiver of one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in the prison with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in the city's cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
25. On October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of investigation, enough evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas's guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of the 1.5 million peso to the casino's representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation will be allowed.
This Monday, the legal commissioner, Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, approached Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for a pardon for the region's brother. On the basis of this, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to that court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been corrected and which of the associates had decided to pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain classified.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is given a legal pardon. In the trial against him, it will not be possible to file a complaint. It is also not possible to claim damages or punishment.
After a trial with a legal commissioner at about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabl Bretón.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, appeared in a prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been granted an official pardon and his case was dropped in the archives.
He also told him that the judge had issued an immediate ordination to release him.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jába presented details of the air accident that killed the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation, which killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, show that the helicopter hit the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft's takeoff, the pilot had stated that the climatic conditions allowed the flight.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit came in contact with the terrain several times, the wings became entangled in the tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for transporting the staff.
In addition, he stated that no parts were found on the ground based on the investigation carried out in the impact area.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not in a different place, so the plane encountered the mainland as complete.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain shows a slope with a gradient of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing was to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation could take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, the director general of the airport and the service of the auspices, said that at the moment of the impact, the Presidential General's helicopter was moving at the cruise speed and the accident occurred on the soft-reared up-to-eared terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine overflight operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At a press conference, a representative of the SCT Pérez Jába named the six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation standards, the flight was conducted according to the rules of the visual flight, meaning the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate take-off conditions, in accordance with the aircraft moving towards the border, between the DF and the state of Mexico were noticeable layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is probably that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and more visibility to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Position of impact.
The crash coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter from the radar are the same, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight before the impact.
Distraction of aircraft remains in a restricted area:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The drawing of the dispersal of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter was complete at the time of the crash on the mainland.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the crash site indicating that there had been an explosion or fire.
The latest investigation results show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the pitch levels ranging from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage in which there was probably a disintegration along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to suggest that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the area of the set-ascurator, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state where the helicopter was still complete.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for obesity for children and adolescents. Research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect the obesity gene in children and the young. Research called "Abre Obesity Genetics in Children and Teentism" will make it possible to obtain overweight results.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Medical Unit at the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, he explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and pupils of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Institute of Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research can also involve the general public, with or not authorized. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will take tests to minors each reindeer from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and from 8. October, this activity is also carried out at the Unlandalcóyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children have been obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Moreloses Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics when it comes to developing obesity and to trace to Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the age of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about the physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), the blood pressure is measured, glucose levels, triglicerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined and genes are studied (he is to be able to identify the genes involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the research reflected the alarm of health professionals' alarming rise in the child's weight.
'Health polls conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was an increase in obesity in boys by 77% and for girls by 47%. There was also a dramatic increase in the case of overweight, said the IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators was to suggest that the country's population differed from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic make-up, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, obesity genetics is commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, to determine whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-coloured wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms suggests the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-trick cells.
The information is confidential so far, with doctors handing it over to their parents in writing and explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three major ingredients that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day, and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also due to a large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt from UNAM there will be no potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty of the UNAM, creates modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture with better functionality, independently of climatic conditions and temperature
If the cobbles were properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season at the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, Rafael Herrera Niner, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) at the ANC, who also added that if the design and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even be able to be removed altogether.
In his lecture, the Technology Cause of Colour, he said in the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture with similar characteristics to the asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of the oil, is a cluster of hydrocarbon molecules, moocclesiles with a large molecular mass called asphalten, and others with low molecular weights called mortars. Together, they give the asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoleastic character of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it acts like a liquid, has a high viscosity at 120 degrees and is almost in firm state at 50 degrees, while at low temperatures asphalt has a tendency to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist from the Chemistry School observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers are the asphalt insert, made up of small stones topped in the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms the liner is topped with asphalt.
When passing through cars or when you create pressure, it is possible to disinheritate the forces in the pavement well.
If it was modified asphalt, they would be disassembled even better, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the asphalt insert is the last layer called a cloak, made up of fine rock, i.e. sand also cloudy in asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rims, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
As part of the cobbles, it will be subject to heavy loads, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and be watched for the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to be remembered. In particular, the water has a great effect on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is damp, the water travels inwards and it's hard to get out, it causes all layers of the tile to soften up the pile and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that the film of the cape was first damaged during the creation of potholes, and afterwards, the asphalt insert was damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs using the appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the National Researcher System, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each single layer of the pile must be commensurate with the load of vehicles and it must be guaranteed that this burden will not be exceeded. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent emergence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to do when it comes to asphalt, and the research is at the beginning. It is worth noting, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle wins the 14th title of the first multi-doiss.
Once again, Valle del Cauca did not reach the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to find herself on the podium of the winner, winning a silver crown and a sash, on the basis of which she became the new new multi-Passes of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and the sceptre took on Miss Atlántico, the department received the 14th title of the first multipiss. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from the Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually named the first multipissis. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Aras (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pineda (1990), Diana Isabel Romero3), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Catalina Giraldo (2007Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
A question that many ask. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favourite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has the guts to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has become the Queen of the Police and the prettiest face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took home the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint only the First Multiss is that it did not convince with its answer to the question: "Which book did you like best and why?" which Martín Murillo Gómez of the Literary Editor Leamos wrote.
When asked by the candidate, she replied:
"I've a lot. I believe in the role of literature, I think it is one form of cultivation. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "Little Prince," a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment." It is a book that is part of the world's literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me by Irene Nemirovski, the Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer did not appeal both because of the term "culturalisation" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the various books mentioned had been to her.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina said she was at peace and pleased with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen is to happen.
And you people, read if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogotian journalist suggested that the candidate's favourite, most celebrated from the start, the one who had taken all the previous awards (the Oster's Gastronomy Challenge, the Public Award for Best Artistic Dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other female applicants, stressing out the Queen, who then failed on the stage.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton and during the two shows before the final to the final tolling.
Although she was beaming on both of them, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm presented by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the "Like Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's first multiple title is confirmed by the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles in the end, does not leave with the Queen's crown during the competition."
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unfriendly attitude toward the media in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just on the record, two days before the election, international jurywoman Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see even more than just physical beauty. The focus must be on social feeling. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
There is also speculation that the candidate Valle has lost points due to flaws in her background and fibrosis that were evident on the bottom. But this is completely at odds with the jury's verdict, which chose miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, the right nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on the back, which I don't think were very noticeable, took away her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the native of Valle made the mistake of undergoing several surgical procedures.
'The surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't work out in Valle.
The body was never her forte, and here it took its toll."
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Beauty Assembly, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled after the swimsuit show. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo had given Melina not to end up giving her the crown.
Whether it's true or not, what is certain is that this day, Melina has started her year of reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition herself.
However, he will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the stirring success in Cartagena, did not make it to the highest crown.
Such was the work of the Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfons Cano
The Cali fingerprinting expert went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, the CTI fingerprints expert in Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of the High Leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana," by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints of the CTI department, this week was the turn of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejad who has been working in court-research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to work his way through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
He moved to the capital, Valle, in 2000, and after completing the courses in question, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. the hands and feet of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation being carried out against the aforementioned Alfonso Canovi, they told Eliazar to bring his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he set off for Cauco in a helicopter from Palmir.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who ran the world's oldest guerilla. So he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenzo (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team in the place where the corpse was, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance. He looked quite different from the media.
He was not wearing a beard, dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, ink, and the transplonent and the light, Eliazar began comparing the dactyl records of the corpse to the card's notes.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
On the same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejad was instructed to confirm to Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón whether he was indeed the High Commander Farc.
Searching for tracks
For the dactyloscophocope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of the operational service against "Can" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in researching crimes such as theft or murder and confirming the identity of the people caught.
When they are caught, a lot of offenders present fake documents or do not have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told us that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house's wall in the house, because in this place the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect prints, but in this case we could get the imprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the event of a murder.
Not long ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle print actually confirmed it.
Although it is not 100% to be confirmed that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
The CTI fingerprints expert explained that the items were "shaped with chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
The prints are then sent to Asif, a delinquent database, or to the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians currently in existence whose data is not recorded anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television programme.
Like everything that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch with is a trace.
However, if it can be used, the appropriate comparison must be made.
"Intercrement" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifestants crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Invision of Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-run in Manhattan Square, from where they were escorted out in the morning. They then tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of manifestants crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go through a court order that allows the "effracky" to return to the site of the "effortly" to return to the site. The other part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in a different place and continue a legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful rallies," said one of the spokesmen of the "Set Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray clarified that the response to the "spanny" of the camp's eviction ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had reached the court where, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forcible evictions and allowed the manifesto to continue to be appointed there.
In addition, the "extrage" took over another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and 6 Avenue, near the entrance to the tunnel Holland, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the rectory grounds at Trinity Church.
They managed to take the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the manifestants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but said he saw that he had also put the handcuffs on to some of the journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have taken up residence at the scene. A delegation of religious officials also came to express their support and also try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestants even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who guarded the square, which sparked "some small clashes," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some officers beat the manifesto.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or use " laws that were published after the claim began, or to prohibit the manifestants from accessing the park with shops or other places they used to use."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of public space and warned the rallies that local laws did not allow them to return with the tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti, an operation in which 200 people were detained and who were approached because the manifestos were "violated by the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place that people did not go to protest but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others," because "some shops got threatening letters" and "neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives."
"The paralysis was appalling in remodle and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of American working people," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "did not weigh freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they planned to organize "big events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which the protests were ongoing. These began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, she will appear in the TV programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement," a lifeguard at "Baywatch," a bunny in "Playboy," wife of the rocker musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show for Canadian television.
CTV's private television station announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs, Michael Bublé, and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known for online domestic pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin holding a doll presenting Santa Claus in a manger.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently served as a presenter on the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour Charlie Sheena, appears on the scene.
As a matter of course, Anderson and Peters will be featured on a special CTV Christmas broadcast by Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a "fisherman" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the fall period that began in March
Since March of last year, Japan's economy has been paralysed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that heals well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to turn the page around with a definitive validity: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% a year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the January-March period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of the machines required to rebuild the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% from the January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impetus that forces us to use the crisis to come out of it to strengthen or to restore infrastructures. It's about using the shortage to start from scratch.
Japan woke up. Especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows were put in the hands of the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a heavy burden on export companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of the major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, did not attribute their weak results to the yen course in July until September.
While markets continue to besiege the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Nod government is cautious.
"We must be careful of the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which anticipates inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing.
It dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even come below the average at 100. It reached the level of 99.3.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign a written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has reigned again, Greece is increasingly embroiled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "coincidence" of the new transitional Greek government is due to the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received when he appointed would likely be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for the new elections for the expected date of 19. February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26. October", Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a vote of confidence in the government tomorrow.
A package with 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the Disciplinary Code of Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not clear the doubts about his position: 'We were committed to helping the transitional government, but we did not commit to anything else'.
The Conservative leader went a little far away at the EU and the IMF in his speech. These organisations are to unblock the 8 billion that Athens is in urgent need. At the same time, however, he said he would not support and sign any commitment to the fulfilment of austerity measures.
Yesterday, the European Commission, enraged by the impact of the talk of the referendum, stressed to Papandre that its demands were insurmountable: it would not unblock any aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties did not sign a "scripted commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and discuss with the new government "what it needs to pay for the sixth part of the 8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
The Greek spillage has a moment longer to knit.
Queen Sofia: 'There are tools for progress and hope'
The Queen highlights the privileged position of Spain in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has "gone a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance."
Queen Sofia yesterday recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and a hope for a better future for all of humanity. It's a tool based on trust in man."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Micro-Lime Summit in Valladolid, believing that there is no doubt" that this kind of operations is "relevant" to reach the Millennium Goals set by the UN until 2015. "In particular, it is about achieving the objectives to achieve a reduction of half the number of people who live with less than one dollar per day, the amount that sets the poverty threshold."
Spain will "multiply to work" and expand the volunteer network of "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the Summint's initiative and contribution, which will last until Thursday, "ensure to create better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have reached much of it" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The micro-loan summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform to support 'basic objectives'.
Her Majesty explained that the aim was for the past two to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to be above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loanes spread to Spain and other countries around the world after the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, embarked on this journey, the Queen said, adding that this was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition."
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who embarked on the path of fighting poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet his lending policy on the spot.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and another meeting, such as Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to establish a constant development, the Queen explained, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title of "the head of the family" awarded to her in Valladolid by the "movement of the poor."
Queen Sofia concluded her performance by urging participants to engage in discussions and the search for a solution, thus allowing the fight to combat the poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that must be followed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the balobytes, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty," and now, more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, has welcomed the success of the concept of giving the trust to the people who are closed by all the doors. The mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants to the city, who "open his gates with a spirit of solidarity that is infectious."
CDU proposes to elect European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the chancellor and Christian Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, especially to be satisfied by party members who see the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow for the Italians as lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission, led by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 abstentions.
A few minutes of standing up at the end of Angela Merkel's performance, and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's main idea and the proposal can be summarised in a slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the chancellor, the time of change has come to light in Europe.
This could be expressed in the amendments to the Lisbon Treaty, allowing the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area members to be strengthened, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage by the aim of giving Europe one face."
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the draft adopted by the Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK is opposed, and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same position.
But the direction is being set out.
Similarly, the delegates rejected a large majority proposal to evaluate the weight of each country in the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will evidently result in Germany's weight enhancement.
Led by the worry of reassuring the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not seek congress in talk of "little" European states or states in trouble, to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Though the proposal on Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes disability fraud?
After the aids, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against work-incaprestoration.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, with a social support office to make a speech on a speech on a recurring debate since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and redistribute solidarity.
As an accompanying this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity, but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on disability.
First, because of the budget savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees on the fourth day of disability before taking sick leave.
Clearly, without the approval of the business, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing much bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in €280 million.
And a measure that would be accompanied by another symbolic reach measure: to give civil servants one day of unpaid sick leave (until they still have no incapacity to default over three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority also launch a fraud-oriented subject this time on abuses tied to work incompetence.
"Checks will be much larger, and furthermore: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand pointed out during an interview given to RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the truth of iniquities in incapacity for work.
These were in fact the subject of constant surveillance since 2002 and of the political onslaught that bore fruit.
The French are not more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - the state-owned health insurance company), more than €237 million of daily allowances were paid out in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 daily compensation, with its 11.3 billion euros, was 5% of health-care spending.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity and occupational accidents and 54% related to incapacity for work, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
So only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14.5 days of disability in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
Average that hides some variations: another poll published in r. In 2007, the Monster.com Work Opportunities Exits website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not chosen any sick leave days.
Another study, this time carried out by the institutions of sickness insurance, specifies that in r. 2010 37.8% of the incapacity for work was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer prone to work-incapacity other than elsewhere.
A single long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (The National Research Center) showed that between 1994 and 2001, overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on work is only a very small part of working under the table.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small in scale.
Strengthening the legislation from r. 2002 has caused systematic checks to exist on incapacity for work for work to be over 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that with 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to the short-term inability of "unjust or too long," i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetences for more than 45 days, 11% of the "unaccaptured or unjustified" cases were counted at 1.2 million inspections, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents far less than a figure expressing black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on the issue, this figure would be 9 to 15 billion euros missing for tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece to have to apply new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to re-establish its economy.
On Monday 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before the parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his government of unity would not be enough to complete the task.
"To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget rescue plan," the head of government said as he made his first public address on Wednesday at the opening of the debate to vote of confidence in parliament.
Application of the decisions taken 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the new government's 'main challenge', as our country's participation in the eurozone is in play, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "quarter in the neighborhood 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after it was 10.6% in the year. 2010 and 15.7% in r. 2009.
The Right Rejects New Average Actions
The leader of the right, Antonis Samaras, voiced his support on Monday with an already-approved measure to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party is not taking any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with his New Democracy MPs.
We have agreed to targets to reduce the deficit and debt and to combat waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder the economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and the Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all the parties to support the measures envisaged, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert commission
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are being denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society is living the idea of denouncing death.
Indeed, only 9% of Canadians accept the ability to talk to the doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society's extensive report, involving six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the Government change the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if that choice appears to be necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
Initially, experts cite a recent poll by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Though Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that the "medicalalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the wish to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average is true for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this is the highest figure with 86% of those who died in the hospital.
As for the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to the experts, who have also inspected all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered as a criminal case, there is no evidence that such criminalisation is caused by any misuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicides to persons not competent or disagreeable.
On the contrary, p. Yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, the report's co-author, confirmed more than numerous cases of these missteps in the teleconferenation in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assuit suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that, according to an inquiry conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow those at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message that the life of old or handicapped people is worth less.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed think they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear on maintaining or interrupting patient care, say the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The expert's commission also requires specialist doctors to be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fearing prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of a paliative or final tilting, already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions, the commission requires that it be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already voiced their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society's experts' report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of expert-signator report as "extreme" among other things because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sufferers in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old can ask to be helped to commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the Résumé news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks as if the authors of the report are driving the authors of the person's autonomy above all the other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the reports on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
Jordanian king calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus talks about "complote"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad rallied in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and talks about "command" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership of the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, countries bordering Syria, took a stand in favor of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed," he said.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts made by the Turkish mediation on the Syrian regime to the company had not been crowned with success since the start of the year.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly harsher line.
The United States rejoiced at the "moving consensus against Assad and the dishonest action of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, European Union, Arab League, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsher tone" against repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces perished in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilian persons"win' when they shoot up and the firefights of heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area of the death toll.
After all, however, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallo estimated that the country was being "chased out of the crisis."
Indeed, he also reacted vividly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he believes is a "hazardous move."
Syria"he will not bow down,"he added with the assurance that the "complators made against Syria will not succeed."
Following his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab States League "mechanism for the protection of civilians" is currently undergone, and plans to send 500 human rights, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favourably in favor of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is behaving "paranoidly."
A new special meeting of the League is being called to Rabat tomorrow to take a position on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on 2 December, in particular anticipating the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by disputures and the liberation of imprisoned manifestants.
Yesterday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the League's decision to be "wrong" as the Arab States' decision," while China urged Syria to adopt the plan to resolve the crisis, but in doing so, to avoid fully promoting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and victims from Italians
The next Italian head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to shape his team and start applying a program that will include"viserias" in order to regain credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties before meeting with trade union and female representatives today.
It should form a relatively slender cabinet made up of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of the numerous parliamentary groups in the talks, after meeting the Prime Minister's Designated Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask the parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti's presentation of a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In the "democracy, the exact terms apply" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its agenda, he stressed, adding that it is "certain that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was initially favourably received by the markets, but the concern reiterated after the eurozone's unexpected industrial production slump in the eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should form a team including mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "politicians" in it."
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. the date of the next election.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the parliamentary's confidence by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with particular urgency and in order to make Italy a strong link in" Europe'
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "i with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its goal of a balanced budget in the r. 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria, the head of the Confindustria business union, Emma Marcegaglia, who will meet with the Mermaid on Tuesday, has focused on the need to revive the economy"s, as the country that shows no growth, cannot adhere to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognised for his expertise and independence,"professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorial, a call to the seriousness" and "jina Italy," represents for Italy "epoch" after 17 years of "berlusconism."
The great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid an early election, as Italy must place state-of-alert bonds for €200 billion by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for an atomic weapon, an American NGO specialized in atomic risk announced on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAAE) and other documents leaked from the UN agency in the identification of the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA gave its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, a broad-based draw from the IAEA documents by V. Danilenko (b. 1934) was to work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds using the blast method.
In the r. 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the resort to set up a business producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties were to lead him to contact him in the morning. 1995 and the amormptom of the European Commission in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was then to work together from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian programme.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data that the development of the detention system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency about it - worked during a substantial part of his working career on this technology within the military nuclear program of the country where it came from."
Anti-Muslim criminal acts and offences up by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, the number of criminal acts and offences targeting Muslims has risen since the r. 2009 to r. 2010 by almost 50%, while at the same time other racial and religious violence fell slightly or rose less.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in the beginning. 2009 in 160 in the morning. 2010, i.e. 49% increase from the procedure of 13% for violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% for offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious criminal offences and offenses.
The total number of hateful criminal acts" risen very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in the r. 2009 it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and the offenses to rise again," stressed Human First rights organization dealing with human rights," the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be seen as a serious violation of a person's rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with these abuses," he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of "hateful criminal acts."
The "Hateful Criminal Act" in American Federal Law is a legacy of the civil rights struggle era.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and resembles more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site's site introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of successors, which is somewhat likened to its Facebook services.
New Offers""inocity" and "name" make it possible to better and directly know the activities of other people who are watching you or those whose answers ("tweets") are being watched.
This makes it possible to know if they allow you to track posts, whether they sign up for new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested" in August on a small percentage of users" before it was expanded to the entire network on Monday, a Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its under-imppermoting work, with the terms somewhat unintelligible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommand de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi ainsi and un public public plus large plus avec un maniement plus a comparable celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" judge the significance of this innovation differently.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Function Actioning will help me to follow some of the elements of my Twitter feed," he sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the inclusion of the golden rule on a balanced budget in the constitution
The government of the grand coalition of the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down the "golden rule" of the budget policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction in Austrian ratings by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is well above the criterion of a maximum of 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one notch of a single degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euro more in interest each year," argued the Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister, the baptismal democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following a request for a summit of the euro area countries held in Brussels on 26. October 2011, where heads of state and government strongly asked to see the end of the year. 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the balance of public accounts was entered into the constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model," Germany being the first European country to take such a "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in the horizon of 2020/11.
Strong only
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if he were to just continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did for the last time, if we find too much volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Y explained to the Senate. Noda.
On Tuesday, he only rose again to the historical values of 31. October forced the Japanese authorities to intervene.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has he regularly risen supported by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe harbour" in the uncertain days of the world economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar hit its way back below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009 the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outburst of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it makes the price of Made in Japan's products more expensive and reduces the value of the proceeds generated by Japanese firms from abroad when they are transferred to the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that have devastated the region of Tohoku in the northeast of the country, Y. Noda, who fears that this hike to the yen will not yet be killed in the egg by a fragile revival.
The world's third economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% in the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of growth in landmarks and disastrous household consumption growth.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's multi-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that the BoJ had previously adopted "assumboss measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) of its purchases of Treasury bills and increased to 55,000 billion just (EUR 195 billion) the ceiling of amounts he devotes to purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidation.
Eurozone:
rates rise, stock exchanges fail
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still being undermined by European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stock exchanges still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling to negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 is down 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions around the revenues from the loans of the euro area states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make only a portion of recent gains."
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo exchange was closing with a 0.7% drop in the market's concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stable," estimates MitsushigeA Akino, the fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This rearpee of uncertainties about the eurozone's future is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10am, the European currency is worth $1.3570 as it drops by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the currency backed down after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal on Monday to allow countries to exit the eurozone in difficulty without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6% threshold
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, on Tuesday, the Italian 10-year bond yields is 6.85%, and the return on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions at the interest rates of the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by the level of its debt.
Greece's new Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the application of the decisions taken on 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the "gaintch task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when the country's elections to the House of Commons are held on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between Germany's 10-year bonds and Spain achieved a new historic high.
In anticipation of euro area growth numbers
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter mainly due to household consumption, i.e. a little better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the second quarter figures to a 0.1% decline in GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in fact, it's the fourth quarter that's the economists most concerned about.
On its part, during the same period, Germany registered growth of 0.5%.
The first estimates for the entire eurozone are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must conquer dogma
If there is a theme that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, it is an energy policy.
The flexibility and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is only natural for a meeting at an election to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and a place that occupies the energy of the core.
The debate will only be successful when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will spark a duplication of demand for electricity from now until 2050 if we don't want to rid a significant part of the world's population from an important part of life.
At the same time, a shortage of fossil resources will need to be faced to continue generating electricity, while it is impossible to forget the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident affects none of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case for Belgium, which makes its decision to find the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor by Switzerland, which it considers it right to build only the last-generation power plants.
In contrast, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
The United States decided to expand its park with one unit after Fukushima by the resumption of the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity by raising the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp rise in CO2 emissions generated by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
We will experience all these unpleasant effects in a matter of months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European Wind Plant Champion, from which he takes 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularity of wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65% or. 50% than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity invoice 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry in the national territory, French businesses enjoy the most expensive electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, making illusory beautiful declarations of re-industrialisation of our country and defending purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of French people refuses to pay, just as it is fundamentally opposed to this energy, as the opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has allowed the sector to be built with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
The highly exporting sector is dragging a large number of small and medium-sized, specialised, job creation firms that cannot be transferred abroad to international markets.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises, and it would lose the 6 billion euros a year that the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
What plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while the bankruptcy of its manufacturer was planned?
In addressing the energy equation, it must be accepted that there is no magical source for energy generation, or that there is no evil one.
The development of low-CO2 emissions installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA attest to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of the new Flamanville power plant.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
Fifty years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred under normal operation conditions and remained free of human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by the design of the reactor and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this crash just as it did for the two previous ones.
The farewoman of this step and the cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in purchasing a nuclear power plant consider it to be stopped by its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to rival AREVA and EDF's competitors and a way to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate thus crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the consecration of the police, the courts and the administration subjected to the calculus policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights" that France boasts about.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment of which was foreign students, which became topical when the Interior Minister (see the newspaper Libération from 23 May) said that France "doesn't need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses."
But so far it has rarely been dismantled at the angle of the economy.
It must be said that there is a rather broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac set up with his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of hordes by Polish plumbers to French territory was shared on the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we deignate to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banality, stating that joint development will make it possible to solve our "migration" problem.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem is perhaps in the election, but it is very expensive economically.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp): among specialists, there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that accept immigrants.
Restricting immigration cripples growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the effects of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put pressure to lower their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complemented than replacements for French employees by doing work in sectors with staff shortages.
Not enough qualified immigrants in sectors that attract French workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer places.
Positive effect on wages
Like a surgeon, he will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, these additions between the French and migrants mean that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% would be triggered by an increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9% in the long term.
And yet it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been set up by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution to public budgets in its entire lives (income minus expenditure) to the public budgets.
At the start of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy made a wish to go for the lack of growth's "bared teeth."
The teeth in question used to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invents democracy, remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for, despite the fact that he invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, he experienced the tragedies of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and the colonels in Greece during the XXth century.
Some people could believe that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and carry out it in the most direct way possible.
But it is known from Napoleon that it was an easyness of thought.
General suffrage, though a prerequisite for democracy, is not a prerequisite sufficient and can become a "something of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of power, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, the judiciary.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been just as a crisis of politics and democracy since the start.
The admission of a mistake by a Greek referendum of yes-no will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: revelations of the need for a great return to political power, but also to reveal a disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the frontline of the democratic struggle has been relocated today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums held according to necessity and disorganised.
Bianko on display to the European absolutist monarch or jump with his feet tied to the emptiness of the nationalist depths: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous performance of selection and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop the list - for the crisis is in Europe.
For it is the whole of Europe, bending in front of the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffer from their incompetence and their lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are uneasy about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be returned urgently.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to get rid of the rule of markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The east of the crisis will envisage decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, or it would lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now strongly demanding a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new phase of European building.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" the Republicans.
A revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
The optimistic atmosphere will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris with the World Chips Card Fair.
According to the cabinet of Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most supporting feature is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay for mass transport or take purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold 460 million chip cards worldwide against the 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise even further in 2012 (the expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Having long been in the grip of the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million of Visa Bank Cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But the big supermarket chains are working for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless passenger cards this year, the MasterCard.
To put a higher gear into gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two major French businesses have committed to systematically distribute their clients' contactless bank cards in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test paying by mobile
But that's only the first stage to the future's means of payment: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to conduct transactions today is only a small number of devices.
"Holded the delay."
"But their real boom should take place next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sale in the world to be 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be fitted with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société générale announced yesterday that it was preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay with a mobile phone without a phone.
Terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are alloys of the Al-Qaida terror group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Niger sect Boko Haram are being confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had now "safe" made sure of it."
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained without elaborating.
Paris appears to have similar analyses.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers in an operation performed by special French troops.
In the rubble after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leading to a Nigerian who was at length in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and a sect.
"This is progress, but it is no doubt necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about the operational co-op for AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself more and more actively," tempers the statements of Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more apparent in Boko Haram's development and manifestations or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same mode of execution as those used by the AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have for a long time regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in the r. 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means"s "Western education" is a sin," approves the founding of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a merger has been a quick success.
The sect is politicizing and demanding strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its followers are launching the fight against the 'central government.
These people first target churches, bars and offices.
In the r. In 2009, Boko Haram's supporters are becoming extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's response is still the same.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
The sect's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group is radicalized and leaves its post in the north.
At Christmas, the 2010 city will carry out an assassination in the city of Jos, in which 80 people will be killed, then another one in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the U.N. local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa to run from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreba has been surrounded by Mali and the igeroos and the Al-Shabaab Movement's Slam militants are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, speaking with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé, said that France was on alert and ready to "take all the information" forward."
The world according to the presidential candidates
In questions about China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are all racing to simplify and unknowledge.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others have been reviewing loud statements and brief foreign policy guidelines, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or aid to Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race to nominate the Republican "Grand Old Party," threatened the Chinese by profession before the World Trade Organization and their accusations to manipulate their currency," a theme in America sharpened by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse, if this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, was almost sticking to the stance that "sages" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is in the last of the polling points, remains disobedient.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfareful voice.
"If Obama re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to his responsibilities toward the partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing will try to develop nuclear capabilities" - evidently ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against the presumed terrorists banned by Obama in the morning. 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They're all far away from him in the morning. 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and still won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the rash of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses about Libya and thus give him the label of the weak
But the attack is not an easy one.
The population is judging President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
He has no confidence in the military interventions from Iraq that lead to a boil-up.
And with the argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking to a more right place.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and conducted along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has started to work.
It must deliver gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that will connect directly to Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned the co-controlled bolt around the control around the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas will begin to flow to Western Europe every year through the first 2 224 km pipeline connecting the St Petersburg region with the Mecklemburg-Pomerany.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of the r. 2012, will make it possible to supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the whole of French consumption.
And it is already recalled to be able to build a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge structure has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without being run around the country by a third state (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
This was most strongly expressed by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact," citing the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in the r. 1939.
It means to say that this is a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater assurance of its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe of energy, because the project has created cracks between Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia managed to establish its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich, high-intensity, gas-consuming Western nations, the deposits of which are nearing their completion, with its deposits coming to an end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the great gas contracts of affairs are both political and economic.
All of this is explained by the wide smiles of Gazprom's leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The undersea pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete casing to be protected from the moorings of the naval vessels.
It is at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
In its construction, it was necessary to avoid the minefields from the time of the Second World War.
"Because of safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipes themselves are a long metal snake weighing like the 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted anywhere by the valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settling down at their coast.
"In the event of a defect, we stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," Jens Müller clarifies.
In the event of a leaking, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, after all, the welds were designed to create leaks once every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is checked from the outside by the ship by an underwater impeller, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This dummy-shaped device of 1 metre in diameter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is being pushed by the gas.
At the finish line, on the three-day journey, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of the metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains the leading position, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The business is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years with a contract that could be renewed all its gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," Jens Müller states.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% by the shareholder and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain to return their costs, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coastline with pine forests.
The 4.5-metre valves form the output gates of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in r. 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - designer notebook
The Italian firm Moleskine, which was founded already fifty years ago, wants to reiterate the joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine noteer is easily discernible in its black rectangular plates and its tarnished white-coloured leaves as if in time aged.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born back in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, will decide at the time to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for a business, is taking over the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old "moleskin" production technique (shallowimation), which is for example used to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by the writer and traveler.
"Mogleskine returned to popularity an old and forgotten subject that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XX century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a leading person at the brand at Modo Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Sales rose by 26% between 2006 and 2010, to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a remote secret production from the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook captures the businessman as well as the student or the professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook is that its owners are people cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded.
The small Italian business, which in its early days had 12 employees, has nearly a hundred today and has had two offices since 2008, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and, through the FNAC store chain, to small boutiques in the middle of cities, where he was able to assert his identity.
"We have watched the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, the brand opened an exhibition" for "Scuit" where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new records of the leopard-like notebook.
Moleskine profits from his success and this cultural aura and diversifies his products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases ... The brand is being expanded to a variety of carriers.
The success that aroused envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new site in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the high proportion of unemployed handicapped workers?
Around 19% of handicapped people are looking for work.
Today it opens on 15. A week for employing the handicapped.
Through the voluntaristic public policy established in the morning. 2005 the percentage of unemployed people is twice as much as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it disheartening?
"No, underlined by Éric Blanchet, the general director of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Handicapies."
"The advancements made in 15 years are remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed people was not two or three times higher."
"However, there is still much to do."
It should be noted that there are numerous obstacles to the unemployed in the handicapped before they start work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They are low in their qualifications: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and of the 2,3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
Finally - long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the handicapped, up from 38% on average.
In short, there are criteria that particularly complicate the return to work and which represent the "core of the problem"," according to Christian Grapamin, the director-general of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabilities.
So much for objective brakes.
What remains is the unaddressed, the ways of thinking that are surely evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that interviewed executives have a "weakable level of knowledge of handicapped people" with an exaggerated notion of persons in a mobile chair and mental or mental shortcomings."
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still a long way from reaching the target of employing 6% of handicapped workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers that come from the r. 2008, they give a flat 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the organization charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
The evidence is the number of "fired" enterprises fined, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The law of the r. In 2005, which increased the contributions, it put up strong pressure on businesses, Pierre Blanc explains."
"But this improvement is also demonstrated by genuine awareness, especially in big businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "How lucky"
Before challenging the French (Bleus) on Tuesday evening (20h45) to challenge the French representatives, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We're not going to go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach was only giving words of praise to his player.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and the national team matches," it is one and the same, justifies himself."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Hazard, spared against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally" aim."
It is not to be forgotten by the concept of "radity".
Play against Bleus, which he has been cheering since the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so because "it's opposite Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", it recalls.
"We cruised at once."
"To play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
The fairness of Leekens also recalled "pride."
"Pride" to fight"game - a holiday."
"Prircular" also to state with the quality of the "neighborhood" that France, a little more than a year after the trauma in the southern African city of Knysna" became a team of very high standards."
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous amount of work," he said, dodging.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in the direction of the French in 2014... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become big," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're healthy hunger."
"You'll realize it for the next games." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's coach Paulo Bento is opening the draw against Bosnia Bosnie (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese national football team, whose helm has been at the helm since 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from luck.
One match and one opponent - Bosnia - remain to play.
Conscious of Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of the Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had the upper hand for more than an hour, but they were unable to score such a rare goal to relieve it.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score goals out there."
But at home at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of the audience, which should create a boiling cauldron there, although the match certainly seems " very balanced," says the optimist, but the shrewdly thinking Bento.
"We expect a very even game, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," the successor of Carlos Queiroz nevertheless relativized.
An indecisive Friday night game in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An undeclared match may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk in itself because we didn't score a goal out there," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
