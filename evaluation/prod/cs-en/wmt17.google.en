28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim&#39;s brother says he can&#39;t think of anyone who would want to hurt him, adding: &quot;He&#39;s finally starting to do well.&quot;
A body found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the medical examiner&#39;s office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
The victim&#39;s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a line cook in Boston, landed his dream job as chef at Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant said they were &quot;shocked and devastated&quot; by his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close-knit family. He will be greatly missed,&quot; said the spokesperson.
Our thoughts and condolences go out to Frank&#39;s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first slept in dormitories, but that recently &quot;he&#39;s finally started to do well.&quot;
&quot;He got an apartment, he was dating a girl,&quot; Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn&#39;t think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with the family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be part of any argument.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
&quot;Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was a diamond in the rough that brightened every day,&quot; he said.

Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and roughly half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernization in individual years, with the exception of 2012, gradually decrease.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, roughly half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent resulted in a reduction of the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
The carrier put a larger share of investments into regional transport, where roughly 60 percent of the mentioned money went, while the company invested 40 percent in the renewal of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle modernizations were not counted, the average age of ČD&#39;s driving vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger wagons are somewhat older, the average age of which, including modernizations, is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classic sets consisting of wagons and pulled by a locomotive are gradually disappearing from Czech and global railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 units, and the number of classic wagons also decreased from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was mainly getting rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
Among the investments that ČD plans to make in the vehicle fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for a speed of up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic expressway.
The contract envisages the purchase of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they cannot get rid of it.
We are completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial staff of the online daily Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a tourist-interesting walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
Highways officials know they&#39;re standing there in the dark, but they say they can&#39;t do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, a flimsy law is to blame for making it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
They need a complex bureaucratic wheel first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start all over again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: on the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno, there is a black advertising billboard on our property next to the state road.
Even three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable construction with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one minded that he was standing right next to the road, in a fifty-meter protective zone, where nothing is allowed to stand for safety reasons.
Road administrators say they simply cannot deal with the billboard because of the loopholed law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
&quot;We can&#39;t just afford that,&quot; says Nina Ledvinová, spokeswoman for the Directorate of Roads and Highways, referring to the complex bureaucratic process that the removal of the billboard must precede by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which the online daily Aktuálně.cz began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In South Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules right next to the road or close to it.
Other regions are in a similar situation.
&quot;We have difficulty forcing companies to remove the banners,&quot; confirms Jiří Klása, head of the transport department of the České Budějovice regional office, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Klása, the leaky law that binds officials is to blame.
First, they have to approach the owner of the billboard in a complicated way to remove the ad.
But company bosses are often unable to catch up, or they know a trick that Aktuálně.cz has already described in the past, when it began to take a more detailed interest in the issue: all you have to do is move the mobile advertising stand a few meters and the officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising into the trash.
That&#39;s because the authority has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
&quot;If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly don&#39;t agree, it is viewed as a new device and we have to contact the owner again,&quot; explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought about by a new law, which from September next year will ban billboards near highways and limit them on Class I roads as well.
Critics point out that the rules for cracking down on illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities will not be relieved.
In this way, companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year by renting illegal spaces, and no one can touch them.
For example, the billboard inviting Lipno belongs to the Commerz Billboard company.
Officials know her well: the municipality of České Budějovice is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with her for billboards erected in black.
The company faces a fine of three hundred thousand in each proceeding.
These are multiple advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of a Class I road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the České Budějovice municipality.
The advertisement that Aktuálně.cz is interested in is not yet among these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to Nina Ledvinová, spokeswoman for the ŘSD, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will thus be brought to the table of regional and then most likely municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that cannot be contacted.
It does not receive mail, and it canceled its official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It is not even clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company&#39;s mail went to South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who became famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative office of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has denied any connection in the past.
At the same time, this spring, when the ŘSD became interested in advertising in Lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had state officials send a letter for the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his boarding house, where the company is said to be based.
Even from this address, however, no one has contacted the highway authorities to date.
A futile struggle.
Similar silence or non-transparent seat changes are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ID number and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the ads continued to stand, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It&#39;s like fighting windmills, admits one of the officials on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet addressed the amendment of the law in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several MPs who were interested in the problem.
But they haven&#39;t developed any activity yet.
On the contrary, there were deputies who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national, but also regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restriction, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don&#39;t hold the fairly well-established impression that if something doesn&#39;t work, the laws need to be changed.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more canola and poppy, statisticians estimate.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, this year&#39;s cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Nevertheless, this year&#39;s harvest exceeds the average for the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
This year&#39;s cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This follows from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a tenth of a drop compared to last year.
But last year&#39;s cereal harvest was above average.
This year&#39;s harvest exceeds the average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, the rapeseed and poppy harvest will be higher this year.
Rapeseed growers will harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when 1.256 million tons were harvested.
This year&#39;s poppy harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year&#39;s.
The expected drop in cereal production is caused by both a decrease in yield per hectare by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tons per hectare and a decrease in the area sown.
Farmers planted three percent fewer fields this year.
According to estimates, winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, will be harvested this year by 3.3 percent less.
At the same time, farmers sowed it in several fields.
However, the decline will be marked by a lower yield per hectare, which will drop to 6.04 tons.
Statisticians expect a drop of roughly one-fifth for spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
The fall in yield is due to a 15.2 percent reduction in sown areas, but also a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, will be harvested by 6.3 percent more.
The rye harvest will also increase.
Statisticians estimate the rapeseed harvest at 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
The sown areas increased by 7.3 percent.
However, the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year&#39;s rapeseed crop will exceed the ten-year average by 13.3 percent, while the sown area is a third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also been increasing.
This year, farmers sowed it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the number of fields is half that.
Thanks to the expansion of the sowing areas, this year&#39;s poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise against last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons.
However, the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police charged two men for an attack with a knife and a machete, the court sent them to custody.
The police charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete in the center of Olomouc on Tuesday.
&quot;Although the attacked man tried to run away, they caused him cuts and lacerations, which required hospital treatment and further treatment,&quot; said police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
The two apparent perpetrators were arrested by the police immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor submitted a proposal to the court to take them into custody, and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
The police accused two detainees of attacking a thirty-five-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers inflicted cuts and slashes on him, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that happened at midday on Tuesday on Svoboda Avenue, the police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková informed.
A mass fight between two families took place in the area of the garden in front of the Trattoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the attacked man tried to run away, they inflicted cuts and slashes on him, which required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
In the fight, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and due to which several police patrols and constables had to intervene on the spot, it was a matter of family disputes.
Criminal investigators accused a thirty-four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc of attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor submitted a proposal to the court to take them into custody, and the court granted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
Attackers also used a machete in the center of Olomouc during a mass fight five years ago, it happened just a few tens of meters away, in front of the Varna discotheque in Riegrov Street.
The police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the establishment who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You will be surprised, maybe you walk past them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty building is the sprawling building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné náměstí.
It should have functioned as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That there is a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often heritage protection, are just empty and empty.
We selected properties in the center using the Práznédomy.cz project, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to the state, which is unable or unwilling to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
The initiative wants the owners to pay a special tax for them
Fidel Castro was almost shot here, Hitler&#39;s brother also lived here.

The Clintons earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
They donated more than a million dollars to Clinton&#39;s charity.
Most of the Clintons&#39; income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of the Clintons&#39; income - over six million dollars - is from their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton began her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed the Clintons paid 34.2 percent in federal income tax last year, plus nine percent in state and local income tax.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar step, he has not yet decided to publish his tax return.
It&#39;s a definite possibility that Donald Trump doesn&#39;t pay any taxes at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after her confession was released.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrecy surrounding Trump&#39;s income, in part to cast doubt on whether her opponent is really as rich as he claims, the AP reported.
Trump&#39;s fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate&#39;s reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, today released a report on his tax payments over the past ten years.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
Polio has re-emerged in Nigeria.
Boko Haram Islamists prevented consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
Polio cases have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the north-east of the country, the government there announced an emergency vaccination, because two children infected with this disease here became paralyzed.
The vaccines were delivered there by helicopters.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, who prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circulating there unnoticed.
An emergency vaccination of children against polio will begin in the north-east of Nigeria, as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno State and another four million in neighboring states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered polio vaccines to the stricken northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate, according to the AP.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had circulated undetected in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have in the past prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children with polio were found on Thursday.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from a part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
Director of WHO&#39;s Polio Eradication Section, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria will start as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active in Borno state for a long time.
The area was made available to international organizations and the government only at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to be significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigeria&#39;s health minister, Isaac Adewole, has admitted that the new polio cases are a big disappointment for the country as Nigeria aims to declare polio eradication in the country next year.
WHO warned that it is possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While in 1988 polio was still present in 125 countries, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and encouraged them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to use this meeting to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for an intensification of the fight against it.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who were freed by the police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the moving stories of the fallen women for more than an hour before urging them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to severe physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
With the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for an intensification of the fight against it, the Pope&#39;s spokesman said.
František often draws attention to the fate of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in April and June this year thanks to his personal invitation.
France strikes jihadist factories.
But it will not work without the help of Muslims.
Muslims themselves are to help France in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer halls.
And others will follow, announced the Minister of the Interior.
Over a hundred jihadist factories operate in the country.
&quot;If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of this religion,&quot; declared Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, he wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the countries of the Persian Gulf.
This is also why preachers who can sow radicalism in France get into the mosques.
&quot;Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,&quot; the prime minister added.
The new French Islamic Foundation will be the key to ensuring he meets these goals.
It should function as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
The French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, now operates in the country.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon affected by internal contradictions and rivalries.
&quot;It&#39;s a total failure,&quot; Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation was already raging.
Everything was accelerated by further terrorist attacks in France, carried out by radicalized Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, recently announced that the new foundation will be established this October.
He will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of the mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
For now, it is not clear where he will get the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special levy or tax on halal food.
Here, in practice, sellers of halal food would pay for providing certification.
Part of this money would then go to the foundation&#39;s coffers.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims going to Mecca.
About 30,000 go there every year for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, only preachers who have gone through special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques in the future.
This should ensure that preaching is consistent with democracy.
We will close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is on a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, the Minister of the Interior announced recently.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled roughly 80 imams and are considering several dozen more.
However, not everyone thinks that the government&#39;s actions can make a significant impact against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people become radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Track runner Kelemen lost to star Baugé in the 1st round of the sprint.
To advance to the round of 16, the Czech track cyclist must fight in remedial rides.
At the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, track cyclist Pavel Kelemen, after progressing from the sprint qualification to the top eighteen, lost in the 1st round a duel with the French great Grégory Baugé, the defender of the silver medal from the previous games in London.
They have to fight for a place in the round of 16 in remedial races.
27 riders competed at the start of the royal discipline on the track, and the best Czech track rider of the moment scored the fourteenth best time.
He managed the 200 with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
Baugé, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio, was waiting for him in the main elimination phase.
In the end, Kelemen caught up with the experienced Frenchman, but he kept his progress.
Defending champion Jason Kenny shone with a great performance.
The 28-year-old Brit ran the third fastest 200m in history and won the qualification in an Olympic record 9.551.
As expected, he easily dealt with the last advancer, the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet with Bradley Wiggins also did well, setting a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km pursuit race and advancing to the final.
They improved the previous best (3:51.659), which belonged to the British four years after the Olympics in London, by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
Junior doctors&#39; representatives have met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Young Doctors Council (JDC) is to ask the full council to support further industry events from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to resolve questions about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with the BMA in July.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had &quot;continued to remain silent&quot; on the issues leading up to the rejection of the contract.
She said: &quot;In light of this, the JDC executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and to request new formal negotiations on all issues.&quot;
In response to the Government&#39;s silence, the JDC Executive today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve the ongoing program of intensified industry action from early September.
The row has led junior doctors to call six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
BMA Young Doctors Leader, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned following a decision to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members in pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary said the contract would put a burden on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of &quot;Irreconcilables&quot;?
It was a gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in a lavish palace hall in St. Petersburg, I got the impression that Ankara wanted more than this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin wasn&#39;t smiling, and he barely exuded warmth, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his &quot;dear friend&quot; Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I didn&#39;t count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm was telling the exact opposite.
But the lingering coolness that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: Turkey&#39;s downing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow&#39;s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin dealt blows around him and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The outrage was all the greater that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, the state-controlled media has waged a massive all-out campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
More serious have been allegations from top government officials that Erdogan&#39;s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he was asking for from President Erdogan.
Russia could declare such a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a hard impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights that transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey every year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be relieved when flights are eventually resumed.
They make money from Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey are allowed again.
&quot;Tourists there, tomatoes back here,&quot; as a report in the Vedemosti newspaper proclaimed.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the lingering animosity of protracted EU accession talks and the entry of Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cooling to sever Turkey&#39;s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly scored bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to showcase what one analyst described to me as an &quot;alliance of the incompatible&quot;: joining forces between two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently assumed the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after nearly three hours of introductory talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they did not even mention the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about the differences between the two, while Putin chose to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of outright disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank&#39;s chief executive, the RBS brand is to be relegated to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank&#39;s global ambitions.
It eased out of them when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At the time, the strategist brands used &quot;RBS&quot; to protect other consumer finance brands.
It has seen millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations rugby championship to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it is better to let national brands stand out more.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of head office and stock exchange coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are coming more to the fore - Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond, and Holt&#39;s Military Bank.
During trips to customers and staff in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan&#39;s questions for us.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand that our employees work for, as we are now becoming much more of a brand bank.&quot;
As the bank itself became a global brand, so did RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our workers will work under those brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
&quot;The time is right for us to move to a brand bank because the fundamental question (we&#39;re asking) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?&quot; said the executive.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say we&#39;re going to be a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But along with how we&#39;ve focused on the customers&#39; needs and not our own, I think a lot of changes are happening.
We can recall these brands again, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to the finish line at Newmarket for the 3000th winner
Dettori splashes the champagne after double win at Newmarket brings him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th win in Britain at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second win of the evening at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat racing.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion žekje Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: &quot;It&#39;s special.&quot;
I am very touched because my family is also here
I am extremely glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It&#39;s not a huge event, it&#39;s not Royal Ascot - it&#39;s a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations as he brings in Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in steeplechase racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who guided more than 4,300 winners to the finish line during his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has achieved a milestone that only a few riders have achieved before him.
It is stylish and strong, but it is precisely its tactical fishtron that sets it apart from the other riders in the weight room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for horse racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that if he didn&#39;t only ride weekends and the big races he would already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie rode winners in Great Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that&#39;s really something.
He has a lively nature which is good for British horse racing. But more importantly, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From flying finishes to flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
Scores of major race winners, including his famous &#39;magnificent seven&#39; at Ascot. But he also survived a plane crash and was banned from starting because of drugs.
He stagnated for the first time three years ago when returning from a 6-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned in top form despite all the doubters.
And it might not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing at least into his 50s.
Russian President Putin fired the head of the presidential office, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin&#39;s closest associates for many years.
The 63-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin &quot;relieved Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential office,&quot; but did not give a reason.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov&#39;s deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vajno was previously a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, in 1972, graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as the head of presidential protocol and the presidential office.
At the appointment, he told Putin: &quot;Thank you for your trust.&quot;
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as the head of state in terms of drafting laws and checking the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vajno be his replacement.
Do smiles convince?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin&#39;s closest associates for a long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As chief of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, both men said that they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But smiles for the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that yet.
But official claims that a man once considered a possible president suddenly aspired to lead Russia&#39;s environmental policy have been met with widespread disbelief.
The Kremlin website quotes remarks addressed to Putin in which Ivanov states: &quot;It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, one might even say problematic post, for four years.
I was chief of the president&#39;s office for four years and eight months, it seems.
Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Before that, he held the position of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At one time, there was even speculation that Ivanov could succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, as a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after punching director
Gibson got into a physical altercation on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his firing was announced.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I&#39;m sorry that this happened,&quot; he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson&#39;s character will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, will be announced at a later date, ABC and CBS said in a statement.
The 54-year-old actor, who rose to fame with his starring role in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared in the series since the first series in 2005.
&quot;I love Criminal Minds and have poured my heart and soul into it over the past twelve years,&quot; Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end. But that won&#39;t be possible now.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team and most of all the wonderful fans this show could ever hope for.
The series is expected to return for a twelfth season on September 28.
In the town of Banff, fish have mysteriously landed in a garden
A Banff man has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels left there by a water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his find on Periscope in the hope that someone might be able to help explain how the 5cm-long fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the North Platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - so the bridge now connects to Fife.
It is therefore the first of four closures between the &quot;platform fans&quot; that are now almost complete around each of the bridge&#39;s three pylons.
The Fife section of the bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspension cables.
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to arrive on the bridge from the mainland.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment for the building of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all witness how the structural engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this section of the bridge on a truly impressive scale.
Despite the bridge&#39;s massive dimensions and weight, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck was a delicate operation that required extreme precision.
A total of over 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, concrete for the final sections of the deck is now being cast in Rosyth so the entire deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of any bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of structural engineering.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters in a southerly direction.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up a grade of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men &#39;lucky to be alive&#39;
Three men are &#39;lucky to be alive&#39; after being washed away from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI Lifeboat Station raised the alarm at 1.20pm UK Summer Time on Friday after crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men struggled to swim to safety as their boat continued unruly.
&quot;We saw their boat circling near them and thought the worst,&quot; said Moelfre lifeboat coxswain Vince Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, a strong wind blew it away from them before we left,&quot; he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man in his 60s was found without a life jacket, exhausted, clinging to a buoy.
All were transferred aboard an inshore lifeboat and transferred back to the lifeboat station
Jones said: “The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat&#39;s engine had an emergency shutdown rope, but it somehow became disconnected from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone from above held a protective hand over the boys.
The judge refuses to deal with the case because of Tluchoř&#39;s wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three MPs who, according to the indictment, should have received a political newsagent&#39;s office, i.e. a lucrative post in exchange for a political concession, from Prime Minister Nečas and his then head of the cabinet, Jana Nagyová.
In 2012, it was about the approval of the tax package.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was unlawful, and thus they received a total of almost 2 million crowns in compensation.
Tluchoř is now acting as a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the courthouse in the Fruit Market and handles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful (she deals with criminal law matters - editor&#39;s note) and prevent possible objections.
The case will probably be handled by another Prague court district.
At the same time, Králová has twice exonerated Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová.
It was the alleged misuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř did not figure.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be so interpreted as to exclude the trial if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in the trial.
I am afraid that it would then be impossible to judge anything at all, he remarked to the newspaper.
&quot;I think it&#39;s a shame,&quot; he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also accused in the case of political newsagents.
However, according to his lawyer Petr Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová), the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, and other accused in the case of misuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová comes to court with her husband.
Tluchořová was supposed to solve the statements about Peroutek.
For example, the exposal&#39;s wife was supposed to judge President Miloš Zeman&#39;s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman declared about him that he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an air raid by Allied forces.
She and her two girlfriends of the same age flew to Syria last February from London&#39;s Gatwick Airport.
The British Home Office did not comment on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who ran away from home were smuggled into Syria across the Turkish border, police say.
According to the media, Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana headed to their other former classmate from London&#39;s Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention and also strained relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that around 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, including around 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream job for a hundred thousand salary.
A great paying job that you don&#39;t even need a college degree for.
This is what the work of ajták looks like at first glance.
And often the other one too.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary by Czech standards (in Prague you can earn up to 180,000 CZK working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, there is a shortage of almost 20,000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the staffing agency Grafton, programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists are among the most sought after.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, candidates are not competing for a job position, but job positions are competing for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a must.
At the same time, university education is not a necessity for ajjaks.
A college degree means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate&#39;s intelligence and educability, but it often has little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which cannot be replaced by a university degree, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money is earned in Prague.
Wages of ajták are everywhere well above the national average.
The most money will be made in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
&quot;Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague,&quot; confirms Kubačka.
The highest earnings are achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno, they can cost 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
When they start, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
The struggle is also for graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case for secondary school graduates.
If companies can&#39;t afford to overpay an expert from another company, they&#39;ll be happy to go for a graduate.
They can raise him as they see fit.
They cannot do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession, but at least decent English is necessary for students.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we come across many cases where companies are mainly looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied with only an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks several foreign languages, he is interesting to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds Director Kubačka.
Yooooo on Google, there&#39;s heaven.
Czech workers can only be quietly envious of Google employees.
Flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs are a matter of course for them, not only for mothers.
&quot;New fathers are given four weeks of additional leave by the company after the birth of a child,&quot; says Martina Joneková, a Google spokeswoman.
Pampering also includes health care for employees and family, catering, transport, training, wellness or massages right at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to get an education has the green light and it doesn&#39;t matter what new thing they want to learn.
But the benefits don&#39;t end there.
Such a full fridge for free is definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (and breakfast and dinner in some locations) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro kitchens in all offices, where people can always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, what is not eaten is put in boxes that the employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible advantages by Czech standards?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
&quot;For Google, it is not important that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, progress or development, ideas and innovative solutions,&quot; adds the spokesperson.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra&#39;ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The Bulgarian government&#39;s official strategy &quot;raises serious concerns about Bulgaria&#39;s non-compliance with international law,&quot; Zeid Ra&#39;ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He pointed out that &quot;it is particularly disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for criminal armed fighters who brazenly organize hunts for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey&quot;.
&quot;One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested,&quot; Zeid emphasized.
And what&#39;s worse - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared to 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It&#39;s fascinating to watch the world change.
Many people have lamented over the past decade that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time away from screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off their couches and into action.
Screen time initially shrunk to television, later to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
It&#39;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I&#39;m talking, of course, about the fad that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then delayed due to massive interest, which led to server overload.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter in a matter of days.
How does it work?
In short, smartphone players go out looking for Pokemon they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can &quot;take a picture&quot; (via a screenshot on their phone) or &quot;catch&quot; them.
The craze has gripped the generation that played the game at a younger age, getting them off their couches and out in search of Pokemon.
In the US, this game has significantly increased the number of steps the &quot;average&quot; person takes each day.
Apple&#39;s Cardiogram smartwatch app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game&#39;s launch, the number of people it tracked who exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company doesn&#39;t have information about who&#39;s playing Pokemon Go — it only sees raw data about exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to get people to &quot;look 30&quot;, &quot;get off the couch&quot; and &quot;be active every day&quot; fall flat because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don&#39;t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You thus cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting for Pokemon.
As usual, there are of course those boring patrons looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, anyone can walk in the door.
And what?
There was a breakthrough.
Back in the day, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn&#39;t give us a reason to do something like this game does.
The novelty wears off and interest in it begins to wane at some point.
But thanks to the success of Pokemon, more games will emerge that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people in their pursuit of activity, health and better shape.

Simone Biles wins gold in women&#39;s gymnastics all-around
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Dynamic on the jump.
Effortless on the beam.
Everyone was speechless at the prostrations.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the all-around title on Thursday, surpassing the others at full speed under the Olympic spotlight.
A total score of 62.198 clearly established her lead over silver medalist and &quot;Final Five&quot; team member Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles (USA) during her balance beam performance in the gymnastics individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the all-around and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
Tears appeared on her face as her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point came to an end.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptional athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold. Her breathtaking routines are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot;the best gymnast she had ever seen.&quot;
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between herself and the burden of too many expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning the gold and silver medals in the women&#39;s all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles got her first Tuesday when she was the exclamation point in a celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked ahead during her long journey to the top, but that&#39;s not entirely true.
Part of her flat routine - one that includes her signature triple somersault with a double twist - is set to Latin music that would be right at home on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arenas.
It is not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman&#39;s mother on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained strength.
She hasn&#39;t lost an all-around event since the summer of 2013 - a streak that can continue for as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafinova briefly took the lead thanks to two spins, it was only an illusion.
The balance beam and floor - where Biles is defending her world championship - await.
She got back into the lead with 15.433 points on balance beam - and finished with 15.933 points on floor.
Raisman gave her a gentle hug as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears welled up around the glittering red, white and blue shadows for Biles as a wish she&#39;d written in her diary as a child came true.
Raismanová&#39;s performance was a bit of payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafinová, but then she won bronze because of the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call &quot;grandma&quot;, was quite ahead.
She sent air kisses to the crowd on her feet, overcome by a comeback that seemed uncertain at times.
For Biles, a post the 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it went viral, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl died in the deadliest attack in decades, Phoenix&#39;s first serial killer case, according to a police report released Thursday. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis&#39; daughter Maleah were shot to death June 12 in a car parked in their driveway.
The report said the gunman was standing on the passenger side and fired eight shots from a handgun. He then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the triple murder was not a robbery because the attacker did not take wallets or the $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said investigators were looking into whether the shooting was connected to any of the previous four attacks.
A total of nine attacks have occurred in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
&quot;It&#39;s happening in a residential area in front of houses,&quot; Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to say what evidence led them to conclude the attacks were linked and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis&#39; daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. The police believe that this serial killer was behind it.
Investigators found shell casings and assembled a bullet from the remains of the bullets in the seat and under the engine hood.
Mother of six-year-old child with microcephaly: &quot;His condition is improving&quot;
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, was unaware of during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I can&#39;t do this.
I can&#39;t handle this.
I&#39;m not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - clearly you are ready for it,&quot; she said.
She and her husband Vincent learn that Edmund may never know them and may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
&quot;My first reaction was that I thought people don&#39;t do this anymore,&quot; explains Picciutová.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He could not sit or crawl until he was three years old. And he still doesn&#39;t speak.
However, it is already slowly meeting some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also really likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth demonstrates sign language using which Edmund says &quot;please sing to me&quot;.
&quot;We&#39;re teaching him sign language,&quot; Picciutova told CBS News.
But it&#39;s no ordinary sign language - he says that Edmund made up some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in Edmund&#39;s case, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to tell what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciutová recalls the emotional toll exacted by an uncertain future.
I keep asking, &quot;What&#39;s next?&quot;
What will be next?

Heavy rains and flooding prompted rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are overflowing their banks and at risk of widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is already on its way to affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor&#39;s office of national security and emergency preparedness, said they are receiving requests for watercraft, boats and sandbags.
Steele said the Tangipahoa precinct alone requested ten thousand sandbags.
Flood watches will remain in place for most of south Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that another 8 to 13 centimeters of rain could fall over the sea.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was on alert Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are forecast to crest over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the danger is downstream flooding in the Ascension precinct, where these flooded streams will drain slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already reached its highest levels on record as of 9 a.m. local time Friday.
Rescuers are still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued off Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water in Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said his other stepson, who lives nearby, tipped him off.
&quot;We woke up and the water was coming,&quot; Hansford said.
We had it up to our waists.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family members are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three of the huge military-style trucks and transported them to the Gloucester fire station, where they remained covered Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, flooding is &quot;rapidly spreading&quot; and authorities are considering evacuations.
According to Krautmann, a spotter near Livinston reported 12 inches of rain fell between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Officials said heavy rain and toll roads forced the evacuation of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that 200 homes were flooded, according to a Tangipahoa elder.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
Village Mayor Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by high water.
Shelters were set up in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond for those who were evacuated.
&quot;They will be able to return home when the water starts receding,&quot; he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in Tangipahoa Township in Hammond due to flooding and sandbags were provided to local residents to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
&quot;The last major flooding here was in March,&quot; said Township Administrator Lacy Landrum.
It looks like these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said steady rain continued to fall along the Gulf Coast.
He said a few homes were reported flooded Thursday, but none were reported Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen water in several places I&#39;ve never seen it before,&quot; Townson said, &quot;and it&#39;s still there.&quot;
Mahaj Brown (6) - &quot;the boy who got shot like a stick&quot;, survived the shooting in Philadelphia
A six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, according to police. This is the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child&#39;s grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
&quot;He took an awful lot of it, his little body was shot like a knife,&quot; his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I ca&#39;nt believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was about to enter the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were also shot: two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there may have been a shootout between several armed men.
Cartridges from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found at the scene.
By all accounts, this was most definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved,&quot; Philadelphia Police Capt. Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are said to be reviewing CCTV footage.
Another 6-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday outside a home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is exactly how I envision the women&#39;s team of gymnasts for this year&#39;s Olympics, for several reasons.
First of all, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is completed by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish descent, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
It also cemented the presence of black and Latina women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast for the past four years has been African-American.
Simone and Gabby were first and second last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women&#39;s singles all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it in gymnastics classes in the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie took the same path to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the &quot;Final Five&quot; because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympics will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs which are supported by parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their wards and families ). And that is far from all.
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent suburban areas that can support the activities.
In these clubs, the gymnasts have all their training and for the families of the gymnasts, it is an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both coached athletes when they started in gymnastics.
It is our responsibility to bring gymnastics training more affordable and accessible to the communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie have inspired.
I founded the foundation for gymnastics 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 inner-city youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics. And that&#39;s great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It&#39;s a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing &quot;girl power&quot; and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Young doctors are set to go on further strikes after Jeremy Hunt&#39;s proposal was rejected
Ministers had hoped to end disagreements over the changes after a revised contract was agreed with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA). But 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July, saying the NHS was in &quot;no man&#39;s land&quot; and further delay would have a damaging impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care during off-peak hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA&#39;s Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will add to the current workforce crisis and therefore treat all doctors fairly. &quot;
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors move under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through negotiation have been met with reluctance to involve dr and often deafening silence from the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt&#39;s promise last month that the option is still open.
&quot;Jeremy Hunt must act now, push for enforcement and address the concerns of young doctors.&quot;
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take the next steps.
During the latest strike at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to stand in for doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers had hoped that disagreements over the changes would be settled after a revised contract was concluded with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA).
The BMA wants higher payments for weekend work for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, has called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: &quot;The industrial action will achieve little or nothing but put pressure on already overstretched teams and services and increase anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, care staff and their families.&quot;
Over the past two months, we have engaged with the Young Doctors Council and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of watchdog and whistleblower.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as workload, training flexibility, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and the gender pay gap - was proof of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health take the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to use the medicine, which costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend giving it to more patients over a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of another attack in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them go on to have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat that forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer breaks off, a blood clot can form, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks loose, it can travel further through the bloodstream, blocking blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to occur.
NICE&#39;s draft guideline, published today, recommends that patients receive 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60mg together with aspirin twice a day for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE&#39;s Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: &quot;Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack will suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.&quot;
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the patient&#39;s quality of life.
Ticagrelor combined with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the proposal.
With the computer culture, scams started to flourish in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year over corruption, linked to a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread fraud in Muslim communities being overlooked, a government report said today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles has slammed the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse because of &quot;ethnic and religious hypersensitivity.&quot;
The former community secretary, now anti-corruption chief, said intimidation of voters based on their religion was so bad that police should cordon off polling stations and protect alarmed voters.
He recommended that voters take an identity document with them and be able to prove who they are at the polls.
Currently, voters only need to provide their name and address.
The report also suggests putting indelible ink on people&#39;s fingers when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It requests that the press be given greater access to meeting documents and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.
“This is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting local government from the wider environment of corruption and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, west London.
Last year, a special election court ruled the city&#39;s incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had &quot;cynically attacked&quot; the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
In his words, Rahman &quot;campaigned to make it a religious duty for devout Muslims to vote for him.&quot;
Up to 300 votes were contested or as a result of identity theft, where a person casts a vote and pretends to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about fraud in postal voting - during which senior members of the Muslim community are alleged to have pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the introduction of proof of identity
His report said: &quot;Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the wishes of their elders, particularly in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.&quot;
&quot;There were concerns that ... state institutions were turning a blind eye to such behavior due to &#39;politically correct&#39; hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.&quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political campaigners from tampering with postal votes to prevent &quot;vote mining.&quot;
The report, now being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for stronger checks on registrations to prevent electoral rolls being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to present proof of identity before voting.
Using indelible ink on people&#39;s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carrying out systematic checks on people&#39;s nationality to ensure they can vote.
Limit applications for automatic postal voting to a period of three years.
Prohibit political canvassers and activists from tampering with cast postal votes and ballot envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute people who use unlawful coercion under the Reform Act 1983.
Prohibit photography in polling stations.
Require only Englishmen to work in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that workers follow the rule that voters go to polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes London police, saying it is &quot;surprising&quot; no criminal charges have been laid following the Tower Hamlets case.
&quot;The Election Court has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices,&quot; he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt - on the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes fruitless &quot;check box checks&quot; at City Hall&#39;s voter registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “Last year&#39;s ruling in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy of being the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten that reputation.
The craze for the cycling double of Duchess Kate and other celebrity doubles at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone crazy this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who bears a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete aiming for gold this year who can boast of her own celebrity double - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently gracing our screens, women&#39;s column FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
Like a hunted game: US archery team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Alongside Kate&#39;s doppelgänger on the cycle track, a number of people online were quick to point out that a certain archer could be star Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s twin.
Team USA archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after pictures emerged of him bearing a striking resemblance to the Wolf of Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard about his resemblance to Lee since he was a little kid.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t see much of a resemblance to himself, except maybe the beard,&quot; Brady told the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s a dude and he&#39;s good looking, so I guess that&#39;s a compliment.&quot;
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be highlighted even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, was rumored to be a copycat of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And looking at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell star Matthew Morrison for several years now.
And for a change: User thinks Nathan is the &quot;athletic version&quot; of the Inception actor
Another long-standing comparison is that of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov boasts not only the same tanned skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And of Team USA&#39;s Nathan Adrian, fans say he looks like &quot;an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.&quot;
Fit women: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eye shapes
Not just one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On Waves Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the couples&#39; similar appearance
One Twitter user recently took to the site to express her delight that &quot;the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.&quot;
Soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who boasts a beautifully wide smile that seems to mimic that of Bravo star Gabrielle Union , girls!
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer &#39;exploded&#39;
Viewers of CBC&#39;s live broadcast of the Olympics on Wednesday were outraged by commentator Byron MacDonald&#39;s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan&#39;s performance. The swimmer finished fourth in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay race
Canada&#39;s CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was &quot;dragging like a stink&quot; and &quot;exploded&quot; during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started spewing his own opinions at the end of the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring &quot;revival&quot; to the CBC commentary team, declared, among other things, &quot;That little 14-year-old from China has given up, you moron.&quot;
Too much excitement, dragged like a stench, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in 1:57.79 - i.e. 1.61 seconds slower than Canada&#39;s Taylor Ruck and enabled the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers in Canada were quick to chime in online, dismayed by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: &quot;Did that CBC announcer claim that the 14 year old swimmer from China &#39;exploded&#39;????&quot;
The idiot didn&#39;t notice he was still on the air.&#39;
Ai Yanhan of China in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay final was described as: &quot;That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.&quot;
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all quarters, with many calling for his resignation
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn&#39;t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: &#39;Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we&#39;re a bunch of racists.#disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald&#39;s live commentary, saying, &quot;We apologize for the comment about the swimmer&#39;s performance that leaked on air.&quot;
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we&#39;re sorry it happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on MacDonald&#39;s behalf
The CBC then copied and pasted their apology in a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about commentator MacDonald&#39;s remarks
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
He sincerely regrets that those words were spoken, they should not have made it to the airwaves.
We quickly apologized to our on-air viewers and those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron&#39;s comments were about the swimmer&#39;s performance, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron apologizes profusely for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized live and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn&#39;t mean it to come off as a personal attack.
&quot;I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women&#39;s relay,&quot; he said on CBC&#39;s broadcast of the Olympics.
&quot;I meant the swimmer&#39;s performance and not the swimmer&#39;s person as such.&quot;
&quot;Needless to say, I meant no disrespect and I&#39;m very sorry.&quot;
Customers at Primark outraged by woman brazenly trying on underwear in the middle of the store
Shoppers weren&#39;t sure which way to look when a woman stripped down to try on knickers on the central sales floor of Primark.
To make matters worse, she tried on the size, took off her panties and put them back on the rack.
She continued browsing and ended up trying on four pairs of knickers at a store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
A Primark store in Folkestone&#39;s Bouverie Place shopping center where a woman tried on knickers before returning them to the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on the underwear, the mystery woman &quot;put her clothes back on and walked out of the store without buying anything.&quot;
She said: &quot;People couldn&#39;t believe their eyes.&quot;
She stood in the middle of the store, took panties from the rack, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
&quot;She didn&#39;t even try to find a discreet spot - she just stood there, brazen as a monkey.&quot;
&quot;Everyone just stared as she took her panties off again and she obviously didn&#39;t like them because she put them back on the rack.&quot;
She did the same with three more before she finally decided she didn&#39;t like anything, got dressed again and left.
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem to care at all who was watching - not even to think about the person who might buy the panties she was trying on.&quot;
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else has worn and no one has cleaned them. That&#39;s gross.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: &quot;When she left I collected the things she was obviously trying on to take them off sale - which is only right.&quot;
&quot;I would be horrified by the thought of bringing home new panties and finding out that another woman had worn them, taken them off, and they hadn&#39;t been washed.&quot;
A spokesman for the Primark store said: &quot;Primark is aware of the incident which took place at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.&quot;
All affected products have been withdrawn from sale.
How to defend yourself against a weapon attack using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, the Grandmaster of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over a bully, whether he approaches you from the front or the back.
If they approach you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and &quot;have a clear shot path.&quot;
You then grip the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then a knee to the groin follows, and while the assailant writhes in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, headbutt him in the face, and begin to back away, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If a gunman is approaching you from the front, it&#39;s a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun, and twist it so the bad guy can&#39;t fire.
At the same time, power up the weapon and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grasp and start backing away, still aiming at him.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don&#39;t forget that the safest way to get out of an ambush - unless you&#39;re a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to spend all your cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
A British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, originally from Suffolk, has licked a euro note, Piccadilly Circus railings, a train toilet flush button and a Russian payphone with his tongue to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each item, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
However, the experiment on the basis of which the film Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength was made produced interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train that thousands of other people have used may seem utterly repulsive, but there&#39;s actually a lot more harmful bacteria in a kitchen sink, for example.
Throughout his trip across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about boosting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked off left him with anything worse than an aftertaste.
Ian Wright has made a name for himself by testing the endurance of his gut by traveling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system - from public railings at train stations to the toilet
In a film he made about it, he says: &quot;Since I was a child, I didn&#39;t really care about my health and put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water.&quot;
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple smear, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer read more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveller&#39;s film called The Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows bacteria counts in various places, such as the bathroom
In the film, he said, &quot;This is pretty much the nastiest thing I&#39;ve ever smelled on a toilet.&quot;
There is nothing dirtier than this!
I won&#39;t lick anything because it&#39;s disgusting here.
The film Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen gut bacteria and the immune system in people.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio&#39;s Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something they would watch with interest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of &quot;let&#39;s call Ian.&quot;
Interest in gut health is said to be becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it&#39;s linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a worldwide phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the film has a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds, &quot;Let&#39;s put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked any of the things I wanted him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet in the movie.&quot;
Some things were naturally easier for Ian to lick, others quite difficult.
I&#39;m glad we filmed licking some of the dirty stuff.&#39;
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent of respondents said they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family in need vandalized a council building in Saltash, Cornwall before being evicted
A socially deprived family have been left with £50,000 worth of damage to their council home after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a series of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the house, housing association officials were shocked to find the property in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn up, trash was strewn all over the floor, and the walls were scribbled.
The family have since moved out and are believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried whether the house would be salvageable.
She said: “It&#39;s been a nightmare for people here and I don&#39;t think people should live like this.
There are a number of factors to consider as this property is likely to go down as a &#39;not so nice part&#39; of Cornwall.
That family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who occasionally stayed at the home, and police said the family&#39;s reign of terror included street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud yelling, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name appeared on the tenancy agreement, was given a sentence for anti-social behavior in June.
Smelly garbage was found in several rooms in the house, which may be demolished.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was ripped out
Neighbors say they&#39;ve seen them fighting in the street, and regularly people call the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the house this week after they were given an extra 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors welcomed the eviction saying their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, &quot;They didn&#39;t care about anyone at all.&quot;
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always like this.
You can&#39;t even count the number of times we&#39;ve seen the police here.
&quot;We couldn&#39;t sleep this morning.&quot;
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we&#39;re not used to it!
It will be nice when they are finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing&#39;s neighborhood watch manager, said the family had failed to co-operate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys were lying around in the overgrown part of the council house
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept responsibility for her own behavior and that of her family. Eviction is always the last step considered by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions must have terrified her neighbors, according to the witness.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the local community who bravely kept us informed.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time send a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said the tenant&#39;s three sons, who lived in the house at various times, were all in their 20s.

The workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that have been left around the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, scales, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possessing Class B drugs which she intended to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth following the eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted with graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who break the rules of their leases
Angela Crow of the Denovo and Cornwall police said the eviction sent a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
&quot;This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and those who would like to follow suit,&quot; she said.
Denove and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after military jet flies low over beach
Tourists enjoying the sunshine in Aveiro, Portugal were scared to death
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted there was no security threat
The moment the low-flying jet swooped down over the packed beach, panic gripped the terrified tourists.
Dramatic footage shows a military jet coming within touching distance of sunbathers on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyover on social media, said: &quot;The plane flew really low twice and at one point it looked like it was going to crash.&quot;
Nuno Arroja adds: &quot;I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.&quot;
Tourists on a beach in Aveiro were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared out of the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to swoop low because it was the only way to inspect the boats.
The plane was reportedly flying slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of people was not threatened.
Forest fires destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of thick fog and smoke from the fires that blocked his view
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats as part of the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with legal regulations.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the bereaved of their prices or issue a written confirmation of order acceptance.
ČOI imposed 41 fines for this, with a total value of 73,000 crowns.
Its spokesperson Jiří Fröhlich informed about it today.
Inspectors found misconduct in 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to not being informed about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral homes also sold products or provided services at prices other than what was agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly marked, and once the seller used a non-officially verified meter.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7,077 crowns.
This concerned urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with the mandatory information.
&quot;Since there are still violations of the law in this specific service area, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year,&quot; Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS has been killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join IS last year, has died in Syria, it has been reported.
Tasnime Akunjee&#39;s lawyer said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, several weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group&#39;s stronghold in the country.
Sultana was 17 and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
&quot;One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going into a war zone - is that it will deter people from ever making a decision,&quot; Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana&#39;s family learned she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a Supreme Court nominee.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he is confident Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland&#39;s nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person to replace the late Supreme Court justice will be chosen by the next president.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he believes Clinton will pick Garland &quot;with some degree of credibility.&quot;
Reid&#39;s spokeswoman later said he had not directly spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to &quot;rock the boat&quot; by choosing someone else.
Garland is the presiding judge of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland&#39;s nomination are &quot;minions&quot; and &quot;cronies&quot; of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for &quot;women and men&quot;
Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of exposed celebrities, NU Muses is looking to find the next generation of top models for its 2017 calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nudity magazine is different from old-school Playboy because &quot;Playboy is for men.&quot;
I do it for women.
Evidently, he thinks the calendar does too.
&quot;We need to get back to portraying timeless and classic nudity where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by photographs of the female body,&quot; Shaw said in a press release for the calendar&#39;s release.
Women want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl headed: who&#39;s really buying records?
Single, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you decide to flood the comments section with pepper notes under the pseudonym NotAllSingleMenInMiddleAge, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramophone records is linked not to a boom in millennials who want to revel in the originality of owning a physical object, but to middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased an album on vinyl are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It&#39;s not really about amassing an enthusiastic fan base either - it&#39;s all about an emotional dimension: older people who buy records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and to be happy alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the YouGov results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV report, the camera would follow me as I head out into a busy street in Soho, dressed in an understated gray suit and gesticulating widely. Then I would stop, hold out my hands, and say something authoritative like, &quot;Well, let&#39;s look at it.&quot;
So let&#39;s take a look at it.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent retailers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and canteens, clothing and office supplies - some fantastic specialist record shops still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I stand near different men in these stores and try to gauge their age and emotional state.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman in her 20s) has an afternoon meeting in London and is looking shops to fill a few hours of time.
I ask him if he is a collector.
&quot;I think so,&quot; he says.
I have about 3 or 4 thousand recordings.
All those recordings line the walls of his living room - pictured above (he emailed me the photo, I didn&#39;t follow him all the way home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy records that he couldn&#39;t afford when they first came out, and he&#39;s buying again what he sold when he was young and didn&#39;t even have a winder.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would have been released when I was 11 or 12. I was too young then to buy them,” he says.
He agrees that people who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company. And he adds: &quot;I don&#39;t smoke and I don&#39;t drink much either.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works at Sister Ray and also thinks many of the customers he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people influenced by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This might explain the boom in record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won&#39;t take you more than a few seconds to find out at a store like Phonica that you&#39;ll find a nice community of like-minded people in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and opt for the familiar surroundings of record covers, things that evoke memories of a peaceful adolescence.
&quot;I think there can be some comfort in filling a void or having something material,&quot; says Wez.
I&#39;m a collector myself, it&#39;s like that for me and I think it&#39;s for a lot of people too.
It&#39;s an easy way to fill up head space.
“We&#39;re all like their social workers!” a co-worker calls out from a pile of records.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy records do not own a record player.
At this point in the report, he probably looked seriously worried while going through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
The &quot;trophy&quot; aspect and resurgence of interest is something Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (count: three middle-aged men) has noticed.
&quot;Someone recently came in and said, &#39;I don&#39;t have a record player yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,&#39;&quot; he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It&#39;s more about the product side than the music.
People come to us and say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a gramophone.&quot;
It&#39;s the younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, which currently has almost an entire floor dedicated to gramophone records, has a much more diverse clientele when I arrive.
There are couples in their seventies, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn&#39;t quite as laid-back as the stores used to be - the latest Wild Beasts synth-pop and sex-filled pop coming out of the speakers instead of draggy jazz, it&#39;s good to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the encroaching mental trauma is hard to gauge when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, walks around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records on sale.
She&#39;s one of those people who would rather window shop than spend in a frenzy.
According to her, she doesn&#39;t earn much, so it is out of the question that she collects records.
It costs a lot of money.
It&#39;s easy to listen to music on a computer or the like. But gramophone records have their magic... ,” he sighs wistfully.
I can&#39;t explain it - it&#39;s unique.
My last stop is the store that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are currently huddled around Polaroid cameras. Then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
To the left is the staircase, the wall of which is lined with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classical music, a staple of any average record collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that you can&#39;t reach them.
It&#39;s purely a &quot;vinyl gimmick&quot;.
But since any appeal to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there&#39;s not much to complain about.
It&#39;s no surprise that the demographic that is more likely to have more time and money than other areas is also the one that spends the most on luxury goods, which vinyl certainly is.
But while according to my findings, YouGov&#39;s results appear to be accurate - at least in record stores, they don&#39;t account for the large number of female vinyl collectors and lovers who actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
They certainly don&#39;t spend their Thursday mornings wandering around record shops on Berwick Street, browsing records and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video reportage
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.

A court in France refused to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected an order by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to close down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, makeshift restaurants selling tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
The Calais prefect&#39;s office argued that the sites needed to be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they posed fire and health risks.
Aid organizations told the court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups do not supplement food for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Controversial makeshift shops and restaurants often provide free shelter and food to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 makeshift shops, but said the prefect of Calais&#39; objections were &quot;completely understandable&quot;.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food outlets, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people who &quot;live in extremely desperate conditions.&quot;
He said the spaces provide peaceful places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the sites threatened with demolition was the camp&#39;s cafe, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum counseling to the hundreds of at-risk unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the &quot;children&#39;s&quot; cafe.
The Guardian received a letter that said closing the cafe &quot;would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as 8 years old.&quot;
The charities Help Refugess and L&#39;Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp had risen to more than 9,000 - the highest ever - after a sharp increase in arrivals over the summer.
He thought she was dead.
Ulč resurrects itself and volleyball Ústí.
&quot;I have been able to train normally since March,&quot; he announced at the start of summer training in full force.
what happened to you
I had bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems because of it.
Because when I was in the Universiade in Korea, I didn&#39;t know that I had any blood problems.
So the long flight to Asia caused the trouble?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and didn&#39;t know it.
It hurt me, no one found anything for me.
Then the clot came up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, it will hurt all the time, especially when it rains or the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He had
Last year at the summer tournament in Drevenice, I didn&#39;t know I had an embolism, and I couldn&#39;t move there at all.
I vomited blood in the evening.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was completely cured for another five days.
I really thought I was dead in Dřevěnice, as well as my girlfriend and family.
I&#39;ve seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
I guess I had to live through it, now it will only go up.
I know that I have some problems with my blood, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
Just when I wanted to immediately return to training in Příbram last year, problems with my heart appeared.
Everything is fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself physically at home to be able to play again.
I&#39;ll knock it, physically I&#39;m better than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I&#39;m looking forward to it, the group looks good, I know most of the guys.
I am curious about the other two foreigners who will come.
Hopefully we can sit down as human beings so that it suits us together.
Will you raise Ústí?
It had a reputation as a slog, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it finished second.
There is a new team in Ústí, only a few players remain.
It was last in the extra league, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We&#39;ll see after the first rounds who will be the loser, maybe not us.
Is coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and has experienced a lot, he will think of better than the last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with his, I made arrangements earlier.
There were also other coaches in the game, one of whom I am good friends with, and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won&#39;t say the name.
Finally Mr. Brom came and I&#39;m glad.
He has a big name, he was in good clubs, he has been training for many decades, he is a former good player.
It will move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get a chance on a not so top team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right away, because you start from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, the Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
How it looks?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we had fun together there a few times, sometimes we sat together in the evening after matches, so we already know each other as friends.
We beat them 3:1, I told him right away at the start of the summer training in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he is a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will still arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I texted with an American, he seems like a nice guy, the Brazilian who knows how he will be able to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I&#39;m a recordist, that is, one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he was, I found how he plays on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed quite cool, the boy jumps, he is tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he would fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to being the number one recording artist?
I didn&#39;t want to take anything else.
After all, I&#39;ll be twenty-four and I&#39;m not in the mood to change.
I&#39;d rather be in the center of things, I&#39;d rather lead the team than someone else.
I probably wouldn&#39;t want to play anymore if I had to be like a second recordist and do it full time. When something isn&#39;t done to its fullest, it&#39;s worth a fart.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in Příbram, when things didn&#39;t go well for Kust as captain, he got injured, then there were money problems and he left.
From then on we went up and I played all the time.
In Brno, where I was a student, I alternated between first and second.
He had an excellent year in Staré Město, after which I had many offers and chose Příbram.
Budějovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn&#39;t finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it&#39;s a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short shot remains Phelps&#39; domain.
&quot;Being on the podium again and hearing the national anthem is as sweet as ever,&quot; Phelps laughed, teary-eyed again.
His fiancee and mother cheered again in the audience, son Boomer this time sleeping soundly with headphones on.
I&#39;m having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It&#39;s crazy - I started competitive swimming 20 years ago and in a few hours it will all be over, he said excitedly.
In the final, the Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long pole position, was almost two seconds behind Phelps.
The bronze went to the Chinese Wang Shun, the bronze medalist in this discipline from last year&#39;s World Championships.
After Al Oerter (discus) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline at four consecutive Games.
For most of the race, another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira stayed in the lead with Phelps.
While the defending gold medalist put on a crushing finish in the final crawl fifty, they fell out of the medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the pole vault, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly race.
The legend could not be overshadowed by his compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the double of the flag - after the 100, he also won the double track in Rio.
In the final, he left the Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind by 37 hundredths, the Russian Yevgeny Rylov finished third.
While from last year&#39;s world championship Murphy has only fifth place in the 200, in Rio he became the king of flagging.
He dethroned Larkin, who achieved the same double at last year&#39;s world championship, from the imaginary throne.
But he won a medal at the Olympics only now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiaková and American Simone Manuelová shared the gold in the 100 crawl.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiaková, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuelová the second after silver from the relay.
She became the first African-American woman in history to win swimming gold at the Olympics.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, sport will become love for them and they will get to where I am, said a moved Manuelová.
The third was Sweden&#39;s Sarah Sjöströmová, who won the 100-meter butterfly race in Rio in a world record and also has silver from the 200-meter crawl.
Australian Cate Campbell, the world record holder, finished sixth.
The 200 breaststroke was won by the Japanese Rie Kanetová, for whom it is the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
She has no precious metal from the World Championships either, her highest was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver medal in Rio was won by Russia&#39;s Yulia Yefimova, who, despite her doping history, is facing hostility from spectators and opponents due to her start at the Games.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don&#39;t know why I have to keep answering these questions.
I am terribly tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
She won the right to start in Rio only at the special CAS sports arbitration panel just before the start of the games.
They handled my appeal and I won.
If someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitration court, she added.
Hermannová: Disappointment, we could have won.
And the midnight start?
I don&#39;t remember that.
The Czechs experienced a special day.
They only found out who they were going to play against less than an hour before the match.
They had to master the tactical preparation in a flash.
And then, at an unusual time, they started the match on the small court number 1.
They didn&#39;t start the first set well, then they caught up with their opponents, but couldn&#39;t manage the end at 19:19.
They were clearly better in the second and equalized, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
Above all, a series of broken serves meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
&quot;We could have beaten the Russians,&quot; Hermannová regretted.
How would you rate the match?
Hermannová: After an unfortunate start, before I started playing, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, the income I was used to before flew away in the last balloon.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set, we came at them with an overview of the court, a different defense and we pressed the serve.
In the tie-break there were horribly bad serves, we lost on this side.
It was disappointing because we could have beaten the Russians.
Sluková: It&#39;s a shame at the beginning of the first set, we lost it there.
We were able to pull it off, but the dots were missing.
The second set was great and the third was decided by service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and that was it, we hesitated a lot there.
It&#39;s a shame because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the small court number 1?
Sluková: Similar to the side yards in China.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o&#39;clock in the morning, complete silence, no music playing, nothing anywhere.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermannová: She was strange.
We started warming up for the match without knowing the opponents, so we couldn&#39;t do tactical preparation like other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) prepared his tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers ready with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on that front.
Do you remember ever starting a match at midnight?
Hermannová: Probably not.
We played at half past eleven, but not at twelve.

Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: Since we already played the last two matches in a group of ten, we already had the regime shifted earlier.
This was another two hours more.
It&#39;s strange, I can&#39;t imagine any other sport has athletes who have to perform at their best at twelve o&#39;clock.
But I think we prepared as best as we could.
We knew it would be like this, but it&#39;s not exactly typical and it probably won&#39;t be my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermannová: Since advancing from the group was our goal, on the one hand, it&#39;s fine, good.
We managed what we said.
But now after the match I&#39;m sad.
Sluková: I will sleep from it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother is here, the first spy sim is coming.
You can&#39;t escape her.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from one of the local operators while in Thailand.
So not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or who got married there.
The Secretary General of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantasith informed that there will be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures that will enable tracking of their location within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means of preserving national security, which will allow solving criminal activities committed by foreigners.
The so-called tourist SIMs are also intended to help detect persons who exceed the permitted length of stay.
In addition to SIMs intended exclusively for Thais, special SIMs for foreigners should also appear at dealers within six months.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently switched on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It will not be possible to turn it off.
&quot;This feature is not available for SIMs for Thais, because we can always track them easily,&quot; added Tantasith.
It must be added that prepaid cards are not anonymous in Thailand like in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators gave out free starter SIMs to tourists at airports.
They were thus completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is also being considered by ten telecommunication regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia and Singapore.
Even in them, SIM registration is currently mandatory, however legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not mean that foreigners are obliged to purchase a local operator&#39;s SIM when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
After the country&#39;s operators have crossed the border, i.e. after the SIM has logged in to their network, they only know the relevant network information.
So they know the phone number but not the owner information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so great that even most tourists start looking for local SIM cards during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners were immediately criticized by foreigners living in Thailand legally.
Tantasith calms down the situation and compares the upcoming system in relation to privacy protection to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to track a specific person.
Any misuse of the system will result in an unspecified penalty.
&quot;If a service provider tracks a SIM&#39;s location without a court order, they will be charged with a crime,&quot; Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While currently a specific number is recycled only after a 90-day period has passed, after which the given SIM has not logged in to the network, in the case of leaving Thailand, the number could be renewed after only fifteen days.
A luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care of the property is taken care of by the manager.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and an elevator in the building, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor swaying, high energy requirements and the like.
A condition was also large terraces, which the old development is unable to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Moderní byt.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová with her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you reach out to them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with an architect to anyone who is designing an apartment from the beginning, as it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to coordinate the interior appropriately based on the client&#39;s wishes.
We already collaborated with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, based on the personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us when renovating our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social and living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, designed as a modern but not cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of execution had to be controlled.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior yourself?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and material samples, but the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we defined what we expected from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that it was our collection of mainly Czech authors, including the works of Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, that helped the architect to navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect&#39;s idea, as were the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then checked together whether everything fits together using visualizations.
Were there any complications during the implementation, because of which you had to give up the original ideas, or, on the contrary, proceed with new ones?
Perhaps only at the initial stage of the project, when we came to the site at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned were actually shadowed by the surrounding buildings.
That&#39;s when we literally changed the layout overnight.
Granite was used on the kitchen counter and on the fireplace wall paneling.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces supplemented with leather, for example on the upholstery of Norma dining and bar chairs by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you planning any changes or is there anything you would like to have done differently today?
I believe that it is a modern, airy interior that above all fulfills its purpose.
We are not planning any changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the area of shading and housing the terraces.
Perhaps the only criticism is the floor, where walnut wood is too delicate for a household with a dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the implementation.
The apartment is on the top floor of a new building, so it was possible to carry out a completely new layout solution and several other modifications as part of the construction.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light pipes in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
This brought daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the master bathroom to the roof terrace to the swimming pool from USSPA is one of the construction modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a pool and hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You are from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I moved quite a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, thanks to which I got to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was starting to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn&#39;t want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere among the people.
It seemed to me that every French person is terribly negative.
People in France are generally negative, but lately it has gotten worse.
It&#39;s interesting that you mention negativism.
This is how some people evaluate the Czech nature.
Trust me, you are not negative compared to the French.
Some people might not feel that way when they come to France because they don&#39;t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
For example, money is a big topic.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is also a problem with people&#39;s behavior towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started to look down on me just because I am a Muslim.
Like I&#39;m some kind of evil.
That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I didn&#39;t know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what happened in Czechoslovakia, but I had no idea what to expect from Prague.
I&#39;ve been here for three years now and I can&#39;t imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of the completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t speak Czech, so I can&#39;t catch any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel that people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress however I want and no one will judge me.
In France, someone always looks at you unpleasantly, for example, if you have strange clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
In my opinion, the people of Prague don&#39;t care about such things.
where do you work now
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then a friend and I set up a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
For now, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to expand it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czech, and two more Czech friends.
I must say that another specific feature of the Czechs is that they keep their distance more at first.
He doesn&#39;t let anyone get close to him right away.
That&#39;s quite a difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses the cheek.
It&#39;s different here, but I understand that it&#39;s a cultural thing, so I try to adapt.
You mentioned that you don&#39;t speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it&#39;s quite easy for me in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in convenience stores or grocery stores.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don&#39;t have much time.
And since everyone can communicate at least a little in English, I don&#39;t have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there is someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you are Muslim?
Basically no.
Maybe it&#39;s also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My supervisor, a Czech woman, once told me about the French football team and said something to the effect of: After all, they are not French, but African.
That touched me quite a bit.
But it has never happened to me that someone would have a problem with the fact that I am a Muslim.
And this despite the fact that a colleague once alerted me to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, that they would scold me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I couldn&#39;t even imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it&#39;s not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
To me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves with your faith?
It is very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn&#39;t feel that way at all.
I try not to watch the news about violence too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that isn&#39;t really my fault.
I&#39;m a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met at Jiřího z Poděbrady square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims together with Christians demonstrated here against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn&#39;t know about that.
But I understand that those people feel the need to prove that they do not agree with violence.
I don&#39;t think they have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn&#39;t cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my co-workers are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a bit more religious than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam, because we each see it a little differently.
I come from France, so I had a different education, for example they learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate position of women.
How do you perceive it?
I do not consider myself subordinate in any way.
On the contrary.
I am a woman, I have power.
The fact that you don&#39;t wear any headgear is also related to this.
For example the hijab?
And it&#39;s mainly the way I was brought up.
My mom, for example, is a really principled Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she simply does not wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how they interpret it.
When a person reads the Quran, he should make up his own mind about those things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur&#39;an that says God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet&#39;s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where headscarves are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far.
I have never felt so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
In my opinion, Prague is the ideal city for that.
Czech Muslims together with Christians demonstrated against violence.
Yachtswoman Kozelská Fenclová was blown to the advancing bars by the wind in Rio.
Czech yachtsman Veronika Kozelská Fenclova won Friday&#39;s sea races in Rio de Janiero, Brazil.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two heats.
This would ensure the Czech Republic&#39;s participation in the final race.
You collect packs like Pokemon.
They want to compete with carriers.
TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger are behind the idea of using already planned routes for transporting shipments.
With the idea, they breathed life into a trio of applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the Převeza domestic application in May.
At the moment, it has a thousand cities uploaded and we will expand the network.
We want to learn it in the Czech Republic first, before we focus more on abroad, says the forty-one-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Převezu application work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and information on how big a package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone might ask for a ride that day.
When the route and delivery time are suitable, it is paired and both receive a mutual notification.
At that moment, a chat will open, where the pair will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register so that every package always finds its courier?
I don&#39;t know the ideal situation, I can&#39;t estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed so that the coverage is completely optimal and each offer is paired with the demand.
It already works on the main routes and is logically easier than, for example, on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also still building trust and realizing that no one will run away with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
We currently have about 5 to 6 thousand people creating paths.
We consider this a success and believe that more will be packed.
Is there a risk that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competitor to the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you will pay maybe a hundred or less, because this is a path that someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, huge multinational carriers feed here, as well as retail chains, where everyone started buying and gradually found out that the quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find a note in their mailbox saying that they should pick up the package at the branch, after 7 p.m. that day at the earliest.
After all, by that time I needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won&#39;t annoy anyone and will send a signal to the competition to keep trying.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither had ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned trips between world capitals, mainly by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they assigned the project to a company that created applications for, for example, MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
Programming took three quarters of a year and they launched the app in March 2016.
They started developing the Převeza application in December last year and released it in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
Mesíkem and Mesíkem Profi have been developing the application since January this year and made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention from the beginning was to make all these applications that would one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The sharing economy has been a topic lately and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren&#39;t you worried about operating in an area about which no one can say much yet where the border of sharing is and where the gray economy is?
It&#39;s the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it is successful and we go up with it, we will be the next thorn in the side of the gray economy.
But although someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to bypass the financial authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make income from it.
What makes you think that the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns or reduces the cost of the trip.
Therein lies the powerful idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like this one to bring them closer together.
Nice stories can be created, people are happy to have helped someone and will tell each other about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say about this application that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier doesn&#39;t run away with the package?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the identity card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to both the service and the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender ratings.
We will also offer insurance, we are still fine-tuning the details.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not take responsibility under criminal law for the contents if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his suitcase, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, the registrants can be traced by the administrative body, which will be the only one who will have the opportunity to look into it, even we ourselves are not able to see them, the data is protected against misuse.
How much money will the courier receive after successful delivery of the package?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender will be charged a few percent extra for arranging the contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent because we want to push the volume.
No one can blame the courier for not delivering the parcel, when he actually delivered it, both receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Either in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small like a cube of butter, medium like a plate of eggs and large like a beer mug.
After that, there are no further restrictions and if someone has room in the car, they can transport, for example, a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what is wanted.
You don&#39;t even need to wrap the thing unless you really want to hide the contents.
You shove the forgotten sweatshirt into the courier&#39;s hand and that&#39;s it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to launch the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it then.
Then he showed me a demo of an app with a multinational reach that mainly targets air travelers.
At that moment I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year of development before we founded the Shippansee LTD company in London for greater credibility of the entire product.
But this isn&#39;t the version you&#39;re primarily focusing on right now.
No, we focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application, because the whole thing had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and we are not dealing with the foreign market that much at the moment.
We know it&#39;s a long shot, but we don&#39;t rush, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive app, the other two were upgrades of sorts.
Převež was created when we thought that the domestic segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of Mesíkem is local, for the city.
But it can send a package to the exact address even to the other side of the world.
It works for the sender in the same way as Převeza, but the difference is that in it, as a courier, you can see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile phone.
We called the application for couriers who want to make a living Mesík Profi.
So can someone actually make extra money by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the latest application will be downloaded in Prague by, for example, a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to save time on their way to work.
Now that everyone is fooling around with those pokemons, they might as well collect this.
A person can see where there are jobs around town, come to it, click and see when it has to be delivered and transport the shipment.
It&#39;s set up cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface, which will be crucial for companies sending shipments, they will fill in their information on the website, i.e. create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service, for example, every month.
Are you working full-time on the project now?
It exhausts us, but we normally have it at work in order to sustain and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor hiding behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other stimuli and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage not the Czech market with us, but who should go with us into a global product and become the next huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 should bring an almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part, and according to the first information, the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours, and the content should be based on the concept of online fighting in the first part.
You can therefore look forward to freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, also includes the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to action passages, the game will also contain levels focused on dexterous movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
To overcome them, for example, double jumps, running along walls and a rope slide are essential.
Sometimes it will also be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maze-like maps and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to raise and lower platforms and close massive doors.
This way you will modify the shape of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We will play as Jack Cooper, an infantryman who dreams of a career as a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, together with Captain Lastimosa, is shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness there will not be kind to him either.
In addition, Lastimosa is mortally wounded in the crash, and Cooper is therefore given the task of getting the captain&#39;s titan up and running.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot&#39;s repair.
Cooper&#39;s conversations with the titan will also be significant.
It will serve the players as a source of information about the soldier&#39;s past, but at the same time the robot&#39;s depersonalized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titan will dryly list all the injuries that Cooper is at risk of during the planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was brought by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to judge in two months, and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 releases on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will be revived, but the original publisher remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ publishing house in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company&#39;s logo and name.
Thanks to this, Nordic released, for example, Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, another 23 games are being developed for the publisher, and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I was retiring, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried for him for a long time, then they got together.
He&#39;s such a big guy, probably her type, because she dated someone similar before me.
She was completely crazy about him.
In those first days her voice even changed, she had such a girlish, in love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched the whole thing.
At that time, he regularly left work at half past four, so she always left at three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later I found out that they meet in his barracks, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were right there.
I got the keys, determined to catch them there.
But I don&#39;t know why, I always ended up sitting at home.
I could never go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife was mind-controlling me.
I think she soon learned that I was controllable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I&#39;m just such a bigot.
At the same time, the neighbors hinted to me that she also knew about it.
I was such an idiot that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all burst, it would be bad.
Only the daughter had any idea that it would affect everyone in the family.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But once I went to his apartment to ask for help with something in the laundry.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was seeing my wife and that everything was pointing to it.
I asked him what he would say to me.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, looking at the ground and not saying a word.
Then also at that time I met his wife once on her way from the store.
I told her, but she didn&#39;t believe it at all.
She didn&#39;t react to it and didn&#39;t say anything to me either.
Nobody said anything to me then.
I&#39;m the kind of person who has never gone anywhere much, who has a hard time meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn&#39;t even think about divorce.
I kept counting on it to end one day.
I told myself that I would forgive her all and life would go on.
But it wasn&#39;t like that.
And I basically never came to terms with all of that.
I still have it in me today.
I used to let her know quite often, but in the end I let it go for peace of mind.
He continues to live next door and I continue to live with her.
It&#39;s just that she&#39;s my housekeeper rather than my wife.
She always did everything at home - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She is hard working.
I think she always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you can say that she is also nice.
But sometimes I want to caress her, hug her and she won&#39;t let me.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she had and likes me, but that she didn&#39;t love me.
And I see that she still loves him, he is her god.
And I don&#39;t like such a life.
Even then, when it started and I took it very badly, I told her once that I didn&#39;t want to live and asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree with that or not.
And that&#39;s what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said: &quot;But there is enough room here.&quot;
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After the terrorist attacks, France steps up the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority call for help.
&quot;If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion,&quot; Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, where preachers inoculated with jihad often come with the money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But it was soon affected by internal contradictions, and therefore never functioned properly.
&quot;It is a total failure,&quot; stated Valls.
The new foundation will probably be headed by former Minister of the Interior and Defense Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are roughly 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled roughly 80 Islamic clerics from the country and are considering the move for several dozen more.
German police also cracked down on jihadist clerics this week.
The imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Right after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate flared up in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
Everything was accelerated by other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
But it is not yet clear where it will get the funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special tax on halal food, that is, especially on meat from slaughters according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers of halal food, for the provision of a permit.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation&#39;s budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims going to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them leave France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have gone through educational programs at French universities should work in French mosques.
Because of this, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
&quot;We have closed twenty of them since December and more will follow,&quot; said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
&quot;There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,&quot; he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning in a shopping center in Zaragoza, northern Spain, writes the Independent newspaper.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in a car outside the mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The uninjured daughter took the woman to the hospital, an ambulance had to come for the man in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer favors light, easy-to-digest foods, but we Czechs are rebels and have our own tastes and our own minds.
And so the summer gardens smell of grilled neck, belly, pork knuckle.
Nothing very healthy, nothing very light, even so sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
It&#39;s true, grilling saves time and dishes, plus it&#39;s a social affair and no one has to be confined to the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make yourself feel good with delicacies that make dining special, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to boil, bake, fry or stew anything for a long time.
And they also contribute to our health.
Whether it&#39;s homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-learned griffs are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as the even easier rolls in rice paper from today&#39;s recipe.
Here even the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is omitted.
The paper can only be softened in water for a moment, and then it only depends on the chef&#39;s imagination, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There is no eyelash like eyelash.
The advantage of many dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the ingredients are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic snacks accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed with several types of vinegar and ginger.
All you have to do is buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the supplement with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate food in various festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of the banana tree are very widespread in many countries of Asia and South America also as a &quot;tool&quot; for the preparation of various baked, boiled and fried foods, which are wrapped in them similar to aluminum foil.
The banana leaf also gives the dish a specific flavor.
They can be bought here in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut in the shape of wheels.
However, choose only leaves that are deep green and therefore healthy - not cracked and without spots.
It is similarly easy to prepare a salad of wakame seaweed, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen.
Anyone who often eats or prepares sushi will probably be familiar with nori seaweed in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which the so-called nori sheets are made by chopping, pressing and drying - i.e. sheets intended for making sushi.
Wakame - a dark green seaweed that grows in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also eaten fresh and dried, and is as popular as nori.
By the way, who does not know miso soup with wakame, it is said that Asian women have used it since ancient times to recover after childbirth.
And in general, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and pounded wakame is also used as a seasoning, for example to season rice.
Fresh algae is first left to infuse in water, then rinsed, placed in boiling water and boiled for half a minute.
After that, they are cooled in ice water, the central ribs are cut out and they are further prepared, for example as a favorite salad.
But buying it ready-made, frozen, is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to wrap a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and don&#39;t throw in an extra grilled belly.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
All you need is a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh dish that combines flavors deliciously.
And it&#39;s done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40g carrots, 40g white radish, 100g green asparagus, 60g salad cucumbers, 60g wakame seaweed and 60g sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First we prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait until it softens.
In the meantime, briefly boil the asparagus shoots in hot water, after about three minutes let them cool quickly in ice water so that they do not lose their color.
We put the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and wrap it up.
We prepare the filling from white radish, carrot and salad cucumber, which we cut into fine strips, mix them with a sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and place on rice paper.
Place the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the rolls and, at the end, decorate the whole dish with wakame seaweed, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain have to settle for silver in rugby sevens, the Fiji selection takes the gold
Great Britain&#39;s impressive performance in rugby sevens came to a devastating halt at the final hurdle, with Fiji beating the British 43-7 in the final match at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio on Thursday night.
The Fijians put on a masterclass in handling, passing, dodging, support play, line running and brute strength - and won gold, their first ever Olympic medal.
Defeat came with the unlikely consolation prize of a silver medal - Britain&#39;s third of the day - and Britain could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic rugby sevens tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard-fought 7-5 win over the South Africans in the semi-final on the same day may have frozen them out in the final.
But Fiji, in their form, would beat even a 15-man team in full health.
It will probably not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice in the fact that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former boss of England at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
They lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens eight years ago under Ryan.
Here they lost the only one.
This defeat may hurt, but the progress is undeniable.
Fiji got off to a spectacular start, deflecting British penetrations for joy.
It was like running behind a line of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and the rest of the team-mates and the World Cup champions were 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau popped up from a corner.
The clock showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The brilliant Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa to prevent him from scoring a third but only slowed the Fijians down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown in the right corner and the British trailed 17-0.
Nakarawa added another on the return and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then broke through the sluggish British and rushed to the line, where he scored.
A break followed the conversion to make it 29-0.
It was as if Fiji had been born for rugby 7s while the British were still learning to pass.
That&#39;s exactly how it is.
The Brits made a flurry of changes after half-time and halted the Fijian onslaught... for four long minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova&#39;s brilliant Fiji break broke through.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown in the left corner to make it 36-7. But the Pacific Islanders won the match a long time ago, and their fans sang, waved flags and danced on the sidewalks.
It was hard not to admire the utterly jubilant attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the Fijians&#39; victory with another attempt.
The whistle blew, the Fijians hugged each other and the British fell to the turf completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-final and Great Britain beat South Africa in a close semi-final - by one conversion.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the defensive line with some dazzling footwork to score a second-half hook.
A brilliant late dump by Marcus Watson, Anthony&#39;s brother from England&#39;s under-15 team, secured victory - and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired to win a rowing race by their coach&#39;s battle with cancer
You won&#39;t find more emotional gold at these Games - and that&#39;s saying something.
From first shot to last, over 220 punishing breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two sitting at the oars, there were three voices in the ship. The voice of ever-present coach Robin Williams was with them as the boat whizzed along towards a second straight Olympic gold in the women&#39;s doubles. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their dominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent athletes gliding across the water with the elegance of swans - does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind every rowing gold medal is a battalion of helping hands, bit by bit making a difference. And no hands were more helpful than those of a coach who, 30 months ago, didn&#39;t know if he would live to see the day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from operable bladder cancer and underwent this operation.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It changes your perspective somewhat.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately for the trio, he was able to start treatment at the start of 2014, in the off-season, keeping his downtime to a minimum - if you can call it that under the circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to pull myself together quickly.
That was the stimulus.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That&#39;s how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
In the immediate aftermath of the win, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to control his own restlessness.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment who is on a mission in Afghanistan, said: &quot;I&#39;ve been at the bottom of my mind this week, maybe it&#39;s a bit extreme but it means so much.&quot;
It re-emphasises how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked together and Robin too.
It&#39;s been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin so far.
We would be nothing without Robin, so a huge thank you goes to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The pair put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn&#39;t match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close in, Stanning and Glover had a very large margin.
We concentrated as much as possible at the given moment.
Helen screamed, &quot;Don&#39;t stop, don&#39;t stop&quot;.
It&#39;s really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn&#39;t want to achieve something famous.
We weren&#39;t looking forward to today&#39;s fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair will take a year to think things over before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to savor the moment.
I didn&#39;t want to say that it would be my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took about six months in London for them to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It makes me feel so much better,” she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says taxi mafia hunter Rubeš to the ground-breaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are indicted, as CT reported.
You made a series of reports in which you exposed the fraudulent practices of those who are supposed to be in the group that will stand trial.
You faced some unpleasant encounters with exposed actors because of it.
How groundbreaking is the news about the indictment of members of an organized group for you?
I expected that there would probably be a trial.
I&#39;m mainly curious about the verdict.
But I don&#39;t think they should be in jail.
That&#39;s useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should give them back by carrying all the people for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
So does this mean that you do not see the possible punishment as effective enough?
For me, it&#39;s enough that some of them are so scared that they don&#39;t do the job anymore.
For example, one makes pingla, another delivers pizza, and one completely missed it.
The defendants can theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
I have a problem with imprisonment in general.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Locking someone in prison, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should give back to society what they took from it.
For a quarter of a century, they have been destroying the name of our country and blatantly robbing people.
So now let them make a good business card and deliver people for free.
I can&#39;t imagine it any other way.
It would work as community service.
Like someone going to pick up trash, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they&#39;ll get parole eventually and not care.
They will find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at the Tomáš Bata University in Zlín.
He belongs to the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Stream.cz internet television, where he participates in a number of programs. He is currently preparing the program Prague Guide, which is mainly intended for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubeš advises them which services to avoid in Prague and which ones he recommends using without fear.
Previously, he filmed series with the names How to do it, City of fraud?, Life in luxury, And enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
The police had been following her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be called mafia?
They are such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from The Godfather.
It is more about mafias - juniors, but they are definitely organized.
If only in the fact that they guard each other&#39;s stands (taxi stands).
Prague is completely parceled out.
I traced that, for example, the main station does not like Pařížská, and Pařížská does not like the taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone just looks after their own place and each group is somehow organized.
It is apparently a complex web.
However, only seven people are indicted in total, six taxi drivers and one former municipality official who warned the driver about the checks.
As you say yourself, the unwanted phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
According to your estimate, what is the percentage among Prague fraudsters in the taxi service?
It&#39;s a very small percentage.
They are still the worst on the street.
I am talking, for example, about Aleš Ryjáček.
This is a person who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I rode with him, he wanted seven hundred for three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
Only a few people chose from the whole large group.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people will therefore make it difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague crime, which apparently has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it&#39;s completely useless.
It will help, but not all evil will be eradicated, that&#39;s true.
Do the taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists always appear in the same places that you showed in the reports, i.e. at the Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes exactly.
They stand in these locations every day and break the ordinances every day.
Both the city police and the Prague municipality ignore it.
It&#39;s not even catty anymore, but complete indifference.
The business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Nevertheless, some of them, even if it is only a part of the group, will end up in court.
This is already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel that it needs to be a little better, I will continue to do it.
You need to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief remains, we should still do something to remove him.
You can&#39;t be satisfied with that.
But that&#39;s not the case, of course there are more of them.
Do you keep trying to confront them directly in taxis?
I do test drives sometimes and I have to say it&#39;s still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, from the same group by the way, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (he used the trick with the decimal point).
He had a receipt for it, the police came, and this taxi driver was so cutely cheeky that he still went to the police and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver pasted the decimal point on the taximeter and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed the faces of those who charged ridiculous amounts for a short ride in your footage?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
How did it turn out with the taxi driver demanding 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying that they could not discuss him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that will, I think, be a problem at the court as well (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side the police.
But according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the municipality may not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed parts about their frauds, the taxi drivers themselves drew my attention to this precedent.
But I always wanted to use the footage only for reporting.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them even in court?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometer, because he would not make a living from it.
You talked about the trick with the decimal point, which especially in front of foreign clients, the underwater taxi drivers move.
Is it still relevant, or are they worried that they will continue to use this gimmick after your reports are published?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
Recently I was driving with a taxi driver, he bragged in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard stuck to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what he had there, he told me: &quot;You know what it is.&quot;
When the fines didn&#39;t work very well for the fraudster taxi drivers, can the trial with their colleagues have a warning effect on them?
Is there anything that can deter them from cheating?
You talked about how you think they will always find a way to cheat.
I think nothing can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to seriously get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that fortunately there are fair taxi drivers in Prague.
But do they feel like going against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they lack intelligence.
They can&#39;t walk in it much and can&#39;t say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it was not very clear what they actually wanted.
They once said that they were not protesting against Uber, that they just wanted the same conditions as this service has, then again they claimed that they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it was the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you overall evaluate the approach of the Prague municipality in solving the problem of fare overcharging?
It can be seen that the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The municipality was short on that.
They had a mole there that brought out information, that is, the taxi department did its job for several years completely unnecessarily.
I hope they charge that official for all the failed checks until the last check so he realizes what he did.
I think that&#39;s the worst part of it.
I even went on one inspection ride with him, which I only found out later from their schedule.
Several months have passed since the publication of the last episodes of the series.
What is the response?
I&#39;m thinking mainly of foreign viewers, who are actually the most focused on the series.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I play the videos for them.
And then when we walk along the Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people who can be seen in the footage are really standing there.
Prague&#39;s infamous celebrities.
But seriously.
I would put a fence around them so people would look at them.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Clearly.
I drive with services where I don&#39;t have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatch centers that are fair.
I have only taken a taxi on the street once since then.
After getting into the car, the driver said to me: &quot;I mean, you have courage.&quot;
Bém disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were already written about in 2005.
In the same year, the former mayor Pavel Bém set out on a test drive disguised as an Italian tourist, and the driver cheated him out of two hundred on the first try.
But editor Rubeš had worse experiences.
The taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for the ride from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which works out to roughly 195 crowns per kilometer, as calculated by the report creators.
At the same time, the Prague municipality set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometer.
There are also other surprising amounts in the recorded reportage: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Pařížská Street to Truhlářská Street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a ride to Anděl, which is 2.5 kilometers, they charge, for example, six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, without chemicals as much as possible and the longer the better.
Dirt comes out of it well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be dug out of the folds.
It&#39;s not easy and it doesn&#39;t happen quickly, restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov v Hájy explained her work.
Hats off to her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding that you have to climb up and down countless times.
&quot;A restorer should be careful, patient and undemanding to the working environment,&quot; she stated.
This is far from her first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back wing of the Frýdlant town hall were restored, she also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuck in Frýdlant, Piet in Frýdlant&#39;s Okružní Street, Marianský sloup in Frýdlant or the atlantes in the facade of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem .
Restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina from Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the deposit of dirt and crusts, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; they will either be anchored to the wall or to each other.
Surface treatment and conservation await them as well.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gilded again.
&quot;After that, it will start with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure gold leaf,&quot; stated Věra Sobotová, the official of the State Monument Care of the Municipal Office in Frýdlant.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone underwent any repairs.
At a closer look, the holes drilled in the marble columns attract attention.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of a tombstone decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately everything disappeared after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years&#39; War.
They literally brushed the tombstone, noted Sobotová.
Restorers are, with a slight exaggeration, right at home in the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were under water, the baptismal font, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone were restored.
&quot;We would also like to venture into stained glass in the future,&quot; revealed Sobotová.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tombstone will cost a total of 128,000 crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not invest any of its own money in this part of the renovation.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from the winnings in the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, explained the mayor of Frýdlant, Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the winnings for the restoration of the tombstone.
Experts&#39; opinions on the future development of selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in a period of one month and half a year.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year.
The American S&amp;P500 index, which underwent a 12% correction in February, is now at a new historical high and has already gained 7% since the beginning of the year.
In this way, the iron rule is once again confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks in the long term, which in the end have always achieved their goal.
In a situation where American stocks are at an all-time high, volatility is disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when the markets grew contentedly and without fear thanks to the quantitative easing of the American central bank and when, just like today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below the limit 12 percent.
And not to.
Although the Fed continues to prepare the markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing is in full swing in Europe and Japan, and last week the Bank of England also joined in, buying 70 billion pounds of bonds over the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is of course the million dollar question.
However, there are currently no risks in sight, the world economy is experiencing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing, and Brexit is basically no longer an issue, so we probably shouldn&#39;t be too surprised if they persist in a similarly calm regime US stocks continue.
Too bad Juncker doesn&#39;t study Klaus!
I am very happy that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, declared the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (really experienced, because he has been through so many different transnational political functions that we would be hard pressed to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the European Commission&#39;s chief negotiator for the terms of Great Britain&#39;s exit from the EU.
Juncker&#39;s selection dashed hopes that it was in the EU&#39;s serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media accepted Barnier&#39;s name as Juncker&#39;s act of war.
Barnier is a staunch European federalist.
They hate Great Britain.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could conceive it: a staunch enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A supporter of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, with a grudge against everything that comes from the financial center of the City of London, he pushed through legislation excessively tough regulations of the financial sector and services.
Thus, this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and apparently ruthless negotiator.
That&#39;s probably not good news.
In this context, how can one not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance, overview and ability of empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is also why Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies today.
It&#39;s a shame that Juncker didn&#39;t learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this regard.
It would be good for everyone!
An earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by the Russian media with reference to the announcement of the press service of the Kremlin.
At the same time, Putin indicated that he was releasing Ivanov at his own request.
In a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24 television station, the president said he was complying with Ivanov&#39;s wish, expressed when he took office, that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov will be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news about the change at the head of the president&#39;s administration, which will now be led by Ivanov&#39;s former deputy Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is known as one of Putin&#39;s closest collaborators.
This former KGB officer previously held the positions of Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
Now he will also leave the seat of a member of the President&#39;s Security Council.
However, during the meeting with Putin, Ivanov stated that he is actually the record holder for the longest stay at the head of the head of state&#39;s administration.
He stayed in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already taken turns in this function.
Neither Kvitová nor doubles players Strýcová and Šafářová will play in the final.
So far, not one of Friday&#39;s tennis matches has managed to turn into a final participation.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her match, losing to Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kvitová was followed by Czech doubles players Šafářivá and Strýcová.
The slayers of the Williams sisters were reaching for a win in the first set, but they missed two set points and the Russians finally captured the set in a shortened game.
They then lost the second set with a ratio of 4:6.
Czech rowing recorded half success in the morning program in Rio: rower Ondřej Synek easily won his semi-final, defeating the second Damir Martin from Croatia by almost a second, despite the relaxation at the end.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Synek.
Unlike him, his opponents had to fight for advancement.
So it took some of their strength away, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s going to be easy, it&#39;s just playing into my hands, said the rower from Prague&#39;s Dukla.
But Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not follow in Snyk&#39;s footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower took fourth place in her race in today&#39;s semi-final, and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
They won&#39;t defend gold from London like that.
It was the first time I didn&#39;t advance to the finals at the Olympics.
I&#39;m a little sorry, but on the other hand, I had a good race and I gave it everything I could.
The opponents were simply better, Topinková Knapková bowed before them.
She fought until the end and believed she would make the elite six at her fourth Games.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew that the girls were balanced, that anyone could advance from that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought that I could advance to the final through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, today she was running the race of her life, said the world champion from 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio was the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who for the second time did not manage to make it through the qualification, this time with a small shot lying down.
In it, Nepal took 33rd place.
The qualification went best for the Russians.
Sergej Kamenskij advanced from the first place with 629 points, Kirill Grigoryan from the second place (628.9).
Nepejchal&#39;s shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also addressed the program in Rio for the first time, including Czech heptathletes Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachová is in eleventh place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-second.
Britain&#39;s Katarina Johnson-Thompson is leading, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as Belgian Nafissatou Thiam, who is currently second.
Both took care of the historically best height performance in the heptathlon.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who is worse?
If we ignore the absurdity of the question posed in this way: German society has gone through deep self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
Both great Eurasian nations saw dictators in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhumane, brutal, and horrific came to power.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of Communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether through daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis exterminated about 6 million Jews in an inhumane way, and the total victims of the Second World War are estimated at 60 million.
Both Germans and Soviets committed atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively, or just through cowardice or burying their heads in the sand.
This is not the specifics of only these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, immediately after the end of the war came denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Daddy, grandfather, why did you participate in such atrocities?
How could you!
This brought true reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites mainly cared about the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, and the well-being of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don&#39;t want to rejoin Alsace-Lorraine or attack someone militarily - for revenge - everyone will admit that.
After the Cold War was lost in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window for possible positive changes closed definitively at the turn of the millennium, when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin&#39;s Russia is revenge, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of their own people is of no value to the top brass.
Beat your own, and strangers will fear.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from rising tensions around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has worsened.
Who benefits from rising tensions?
After a longer period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from the two opposing sides contradict each other and are difficult to independently verify, so we can only ponder the old familiar question, who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine, of course, rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
The information about the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia already received the well-known answer from the case of the pilot Savchenko, that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we were to follow the Ukrainian version, how would the deterioration of the situation around Crimea benefit Russia?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, especially from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, against the backdrop of the immigration crisis in Europe, attention has shifted away from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost its credit in front of its citizens, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine&#39;s economy would have gone bankrupt a long time ago if it were not for generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention to its country strongly again, in order to justify its further requests for financial aid and to try to improve its reputation with the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the armed forces once again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their huge responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both opposing sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero reading since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average rate of inflation, measured by the CPI index, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 month period (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The year-to-date inflation rate (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in trips of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1, 2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and general maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The US Secret Service is said to have been monitoring hacking attacks by Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks became public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was looking into an attack on the servers of the Democratic party headquarters.
However, no official report mentions Russia&#39;s involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its release would reveal that the US secret services are monitoring the hacking attack, and could reveal how they are doing it and what resources they are using.
Two Russian intelligence services are said to have participated in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The material on tracking the Russian trail was coded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the Gang of Eight in the US, were informed.
It consists of the leaders of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic leaders of both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the defense and security committees of Congress.
Acting Democratic Party Chairwoman Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is creating a cybersecurity advisory council to &quot;prevent future attacks and ensure the best-in-class protection of Democratic Party servers.&quot;
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Alberta.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of a consumer complaint about health problems after consuming the food Wild smoked salmon - pieces 100 g, expiry date 22 November 2016, Prague hygienists carried out an inspection in the Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstek.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with an expiry date of 22/11/2016, which the customer had pointed out, was no longer available, therefore the product of the same batch with an expiry date of 11/12/2016 was withdrawn.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
The latter is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and live larvae eaten by humans can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Šticha.
We sincerely apologize to customers for the problems with this branded product.
We have immediately withdrawn the said batch from sale and, as a precaution, we have also withdrawn all other batches of this item.
The mistake occurred on the part of the supplier with whom we are negotiating, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, spokeswoman for Alberta Barbora Vanko told Novinka.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it to any of the chain&#39;s stores and receive a refund.
Frost and sufficient heat treatment will destroy the larvae
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration about the presence of a dangerous product.
According to the server bezpecnostpotravin.cz, people can get sick with anisakiosis after eating the parasite, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can be asymptomatic, ČTK reported.
Symptoms appear one to two weeks after eating undercooked infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either when the fish meat is sufficiently heat-treated or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians also checked the salmon at the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemia region.
Three of the five samples examined had the parasite in them.
According to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS), the shipment with 1,700 products arrived in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April.
To date, 919 packages have been dispatched, the vast majority to the Ahold chain.
Unsold stocks of the product are currently being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told ČTK on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately banned the shipment of other products from the warehouse after finding positive samples.
A 17-year-old British girl wanted to flee Raqqa, she was apparently killed by a Russian airstrike.
After initial excitement and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, came a sobriety.
The expected paradise of the caliphate turned into a hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She repeatedly called her in Britain and confided that she wanted to return home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot indiscriminately, The Telegraph quotes the lawyer of the deceased girl&#39;s family, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last traces led to Rakka, from where the girl spoke for the last time.
Then there was only the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from a flat in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape, as the house she was staying in was leveled by an airstrike in May, Britain&#39;s ITV News reported.
The television added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You would bear the blue sky just to get your child out of the danger zone, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family&#39;s lawyer.
In the week that (Kadiza) was thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and was reportedly publicly beaten to death.
I think she (Kadiza) interpreted it as a warning and decided not to risk it, according to BBC Akunjee.
Family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set off on the trip on February 17 last year.
At home they only said that they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl&#39;s family was doing everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
You would drop the blue sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything they could, pulled out all the stops to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
According to him, the only positive thing is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
&quot;There are many cases where people went there, realized how things were there, understood how far it was from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to go back,&quot; Akunjee further stated.
The fate of Kadiza&#39;s classmates is unknown.
But since they have also gone silent, their families have to accept the fact that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries the village of Inveraray was the county seat and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Courts were held in the town hall from the mid-18th century, and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were deplorable and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much friendlier to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for long, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, as smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunting.
The prison opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were in them.
Guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room on display where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were used on criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can let themselves be locked in one of the cells, mostly for a souvenir photo or to get a sense of what prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland&#39;s most famous haunted locations.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
However, such a night will cost 300 pounds, which is roughly 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the municipality also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The &quot;anime&quot; effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it&#39;s racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows some 150 million users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that looks like it stepped out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
Any mistake will be published immediately.
Snapchat&#39;s filters have drawn criticism in the past, with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin tones as the ideal of beauty.
So when it offered users a filter this week that gave users slanted eyes, crooked teeth and puffy faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - &quot;yellowface.&quot;
And they wondered if these repeated contentious questions pointed to a larger problem in society - a problem with diversity.
The Verge and Motherboard wrote about it on Wednesday, and the news and outrage quickly spread, with Snapchat announcing the very next day that it was removing the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
Others bluntly rejected the comparison to animé.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was &quot;harmful and embarrassing, to say the least.&quot;
She added that &quot;it&#39;s hard to argue against comparing blatant Asian caricature and filter effects.&quot;
It turns out that the filter is not only about yellowface, but that yellowface is taken to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat isn&#39;t the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
From corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands, American culture seems to have a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion.
And the sheer number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts — may mean even more sensitivity is to be expected.
&quot;When one Snapchat filter creates an image that&#39;s offensive to some user,&quot; Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday, &quot;it&#39;s very hard to go unnoticed today like it used to.&quot;
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes the racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat&#39;s hiring process.
Katie Zhu criticized the company&#39;s overwhelmingly white, all-male leadership and ended the article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It&#39;s either that they don&#39;t have diversity on staff and people of color at the time these things are being decided,” said Zhu, who is Chinese-American, “or people of color are working there but not in positions to they felt safe or comfortable to speak up.”
Other observers share her view — a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures regarding the diversity of its employees, saying it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, &quot;I wonder if they really need more users like that who can say it&#39;s wrong,&quot; adding that her account will remain suspended.
Army officers misrepresented intelligence on IS, says parliamentary committee
A parliamentary committee said in a report released Thursday that officers at United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground provided.
According to a preliminary report by a task force assembled by the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense, there was &quot;widespread dissatisfaction&quot; among Central Intelligence Agency analysts who said their superiors were changing their assessment of America&#39;s efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CentCom, is the Army headquarters in Tampa, Florida that oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A press statement on the report stated, &quot;Intelligence statements endorsed by senior Centcom officers typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than was borne out by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyzes obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.&quot;
&quot;What happened at Centcom is unacceptable -- our warfighters are harmed when senior policymakers are presented with flawed analysis,&quot; said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
Centcom&#39;s leadership failure extends to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the Central Staff&#39;s continuing problems in describing and analyzing US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no conclusive evidence was offered that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be altered, the report said analysts felt pressured by Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State , or IS.
&quot;In the first half of 2015, many central staff press releases, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than what actually happened,&quot; the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq&#39;s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
&quot;This is abundantly clear after months of investigation,&quot; Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking US Central Staff intelligence officials manipulated the staff&#39;s intelligence outputs to downplay the danger of IS in Iraq.
Republicans formed the task force after learning of analysts&#39; concerns that intelligence information on the Islamic State was being manipulated.
A report released on Thursday is subject to further investigation following a more detailed investigation.
Another investigation is underway at Centcom Intelligence, led by the Defense Department&#39;s inspector general.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings Thursday, which echoed some of the Republican task force&#39;s conclusions.
&quot;Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling intelligence assessments of IS and Iraqi security forces,&quot; Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the committee&#39;s chairman and a Democrat, said in a statement.
In the words of Adam Schiff, the process &quot;led to a distortion of intelligence output,&quot; damaged morale among analysts, and &quot;failed to accommodate dissenting views.&quot;
However, Schiff and Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions based on &quot;the blueprint or the political situation.&quot;
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general, which was launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the parliamentary report because the inspector general&#39;s investigation was still ongoing.
But he said that &quot;experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue about these critical national security issues.&quot;
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (a claim now being made by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year&#39;s allegations have raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the Central Command&#39;s honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis hotspots.
Intelligence criticism of the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than a decade, with Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker writing a research paper that said President George W. Bush&#39;s administration — despite the objections of many analysts — advocated a small force in Iraq and devoted only little time to think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker&#39;s team concluded that, despite public claims to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State refineries have not significantly weakened the terrorist group&#39;s financial resources because the group has built temporary refineries and sells oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been passed on outside of central headquarters.
Centcom Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, then came under fire last year after many lawmakers found Senate testimony overly positive about the war.
Gen. Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The USA won their fourth straight field hockey game, so today will be a deciding game against Team Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan, and just a day after that, she scored the first two goals for the U.S. women&#39;s field hockey team in a 3-0 win over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a feat worth remembering, but Bam, 27, said she wasn&#39;t sure if she had ever done anything like it.
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; she said.
I&#39;m not one of those people who write down their goals.
But this much he does know: The Americans are 4-0 heading into the Olympic tournament and tied for first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide who will finish first and second from the group of six teams.
The team from first place will take a little longer to avoid the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group.
No matter how Saturday&#39;s game ends, the Americans have caused a stir with their surprise run here, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bamová was also in that team.
Raised in Blue Bell, Pa., she picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at age 3 (her twin older sisters played at Drexel) and joined the national team at 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she did not make the final roster.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor her team members did very well.
The following year Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
&quot;Cultural change, mental change, physical change,&quot; Bam said.
In London we didn&#39;t have the pace of work we have today.
We did a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bamová opened the first half with a goal from close range.
India went into the match without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the field, then weaved her way up the middle and fired the ball into the net to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth quarter.
The shutout of U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had an assist in each of the three wins, was the first of the tournament.
He is in great shape.
Just like Bam.
&quot;We&#39;re in a good place now,&quot; Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday&#39;s game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
It doesn&#39;t matter where you are, it doesn&#39;t matter what time it is - it&#39;s the Olympics.
There is a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competitiveness and effort from the events in Rio de Janeiro.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a red-hot relay leg being passed from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can&#39;t turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbor&#39;s conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there&#39;s Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the up-and-coming darling of dimpled women, is in his first Olympics and could also be among those whose names ring in prime-time households between commercials and sponsor spots if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is fighting for Olympic gold in springboard diving.
The Olympic flame does not shine equally for all competitions.
Far from the center, a little in the shadows, there are sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably reign for a long time.
But if I can name an extraordinary favorite, let me point to the understated charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since it was first introduced at the Sydney Games in 2000, after 16 years of intervention the sport remains largely unnoticed - many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in springboard jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Prizes in the men&#39;s category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the women&#39;s category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be won by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
Trampoline jumping, however, has another misfortune, partly because to the uninitiated it will seem more suited to clown university than the Olympics.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential - the comic vibes of endless bouncing - but also the gracefulness of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines.
The word &quot;trampoline&quot; is derived from the Spanish &quot;el trampolín&quot; which means &quot;spring board.&quot;
Aspiring champions jump onto a giant trampoline that launches them almost 10 meters high and perform multi-element routines (somersaults, twists and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are graded according to execution, difficulty and &quot;time in the air&quot;.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Gold medalists must go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
They are trying to catch up not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, as the TV news reports, to another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This single-minded effort is classy, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring viewers to tears.
But I think it&#39;s also kind of exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Trampoline jumps bring relief in this regard.
The trajectory of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces as if in a weightless state like an astronaut, flying up, then down, then up again effortlessly.
It cannot be done without competition and, of course, difficulty, but for the duration of the composition there is no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no measuring of distance, but only a perfect, graceful springing of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and Zen will ever come.
The women&#39;s qualifiers and finals take place on Friday afternoon at 1pm ET, with the men&#39;s competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will air the finals in an afternoon slot starting at 2 p.m. both days.
In the middle of the Olympic frenzy, they promise calm, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook due to the other fights.
And if the only way to get attention is by making male athletes the object of amorous gazes and objectification - as USA gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to gasp.
A &quot;Protesting Generation&quot; in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government&#39;s response was merciless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
In circulating video footage of the protests, believed to date from late last year or early this year, security forces are seen beating young people with sticks after they were forced to stand on their hands against a wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
&quot;It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will be even more difficult to take a step forward,&quot; said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
US military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few, if any, African countries receive such help from the West.
Ethiopia&#39;s economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has been fundamentally improved - there is even a new suburban train running in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the city streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - organizations fighting for human rights constantly talk about government repression - opposition in the country was suppressed, dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many were banished, imprisoned, put to death or driven far into the desert.
However, this may change.
&quot;When you stifle people and they have no choice but to protest, there is a breakthrough,&quot; said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.
Grievances are numerous and range from land disputes to the ruling coalition&#39;s absolute grip on power.
After last year&#39;s widely criticized election, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, pressure is increasing on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the confusion and rearm.
There are several factors that explain why, after years of simmering under the surface, these bitter feelings have re-ignited.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians have only been able to communicate via social media in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones became common and internet service delivery improved.
And even if the government blocks access to Facebook or Twitter, as is common especially during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide their location.
Several young Ethiopians spoke of how they gathered for protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oromo and the Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For centuries the Amharas, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that is also changing.
&quot;We are on the way to a unified leadership,&quot; said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The largest protests occurred in areas populated by Amhara and Oromo people.
Many Amharas and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up about 6 percent of the population and control the military, intelligence services, business and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia&#39;s prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an undisclosed illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, someone who could see beyond the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signs of discontent, using emissaries to process opponents and win them over to his side.
&quot;The current regime lacks basic knowledge,&quot; said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia&#39;s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tigrean-dominated security services.
Many fear that more bloodshed will result.
The last time Ethiopia saw such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government botched and then stole.
A crackdown followed, during which many protesters were killed - though fewer than in previous months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia&#39;s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning such as a new commuter train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that this did not stop the gradual increase of disputes within the Ethiopian government.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigrean-owned business firms, and resentment against Tigreans on social media has become increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests embarrass the US and other Western allies.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for drone overflights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base had been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile region.
&quot;That,&quot; said Abdi, &quot;is a very sharp edge of the blade.&quot;
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as &quot;sarcasm&quot;
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to play down the latest controversy engulfing his campaign, saying he didn&#39;t mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the &quot;founders&quot; of the Islamic State terror group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee&#39;s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who defended him diligently during the stormy period, and have to explain that he may not have meant his remarks.
Following that suggestion in a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not mean to say that the president and Clinton created IS.
But in a post on Twitter Friday morning, Trump said he was only being sarcastic.
The post was a reversal of claims just a day old, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about the allegations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump tone down the remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy IS, the Republican presidential nominee did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump has tried to refocus his campaign on the economy, while his popularity in the polls has been falling.
Trump and Clinton have been dueling in Michigan this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic again.
He again warned on Twitter that Clinton&#39;s proposals were linked to tax increases and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, when he drew criticism for suggesting that the Russians had hacked Clinton&#39;s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, &quot;I&#39;m being sarcastic, of course.&quot;
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of policy statements and temper them as needed.
&quot;I think it&#39;s his way of testing how certain messages resonate with his supporters, to see how they react, and then depending on the reaction, he &#39;gives an explanation&#39; in one way or another,&quot; said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who he watched the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he&#39;s deft with his statements and knows they&#39;re vague enough to be interpreted in different ways.
As the polls continue to slide in his favor, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days rather than toning things down for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a wide margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close in Florida.
Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces heightened scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump&#39;s jokes have embarrassed his loyal supporters, who must publicly stand behind him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump&#39;s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate at length in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
&quot;I think what he&#39;s saying is a legitimate political comment,&quot; Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump&#39;s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he quite mistakenly called a rookie. And it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, under which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed IS to flourish and failed to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday&#39;s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to take to Twitter to fire at the media for hanging on his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the &quot;poor, pathetic&quot; TV pundits who try to understand him, saying: &quot;They can&#39;t!&quot;
Several Democrats scoffed at Trump&#39;s apology, saying it was just more evidence that he is unfit for the presidency.
Prices pushed the cafe out of the market. Now he&#39;s back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a seedy, cash-only place in Williamsburg with no Wi-Fi, but it had been serving coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the shop that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: &quot;New York is changing I know, but I still can&#39;t believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel ransacked and Verb is now a soap shop.&quot;
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original staff work there and it has a similar, low-key atmosphere.
The coffee is still good too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even reused the lighting from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You can also find brown rice bowls here.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady stream of original regulars.
&quot;A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,&quot; he said.
Last Sunday, one such customer, Rebecca Oliveira, was here.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb Cafe.
She continued even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee altogether for a while.
“I found that what I love is the coffee and the culture at Verb,” she said.
Now she&#39;s drinking coffee again, but the other day she had a blended chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a loyal Verbo visitor since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
&quot;At a quarter to eight every day, like clockwork, I come here and they are already preparing my bun with everything and butter for me,&quot; he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he gets bacon, eggs and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he doesn&#39;t regret the soap shop taking over his old location.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, using filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
&quot;I think we could still use it,&quot; Rodriguez said.
The cafe was also well received by Greenpoint&#39;s traditional Polish residents.
One of the new customers translated the listing into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wants to find a place to display it soon so his new neighbors feel at home.
The new location has other advantages.
A local fruit juice producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the cafe to expand into a neighboring building.
For many customers, just getting back their old favorite is enough.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said he was heartbroken when the cafe closed.
Mr Whitt says that when the cafe has reopened, walking in and getting a coffee is like coming home.
&quot;I missed the smell,&quot; he said.
Depression-era food - in &quot;Square Meal&quot;
Shortly after taking office as president in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Office having lunch.
A foodie, President Roosevelt enjoyed select 5th Avenue dishes such as foie gras pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding for dessert.
&quot;It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering,&quot; Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, &quot;It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.&quot;
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are devoted to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe&#39;s last book &quot;Chop Suey&quot; was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane&#39;s book &quot;97 Orchard&quot; tells the life story of a Lower East Side tenement through food.
Their new collaborative work, &quot;A Square Meal,&quot; to be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity themselves and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg&#39;s Sandwich Shop, a small, austere Flatiron buffet that has been in business since the Depression, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was perfect for a conversation about food during the crisis.
&quot;The meatballs were very popular,&quot; said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean meatballs were sold.
Other cheap foods that set the ingredient were made from that admixture.
Reconstruct the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe smirked.
&quot;They would sit in your stomach like lead,&quot; he said.
In the pre-crisis years, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. &quot;A Square Meal&quot; traces the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of plenty.
&quot;It was a time when food became a central, feared issue for the American people,&quot; Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mystery foods like meatballs and casseroles proliferated, the casserole a &quot;wonderful way to use up leftovers,&quot; Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the focal point of the American meal - has become a sparingly rationed luxury.
Strange concoctions meant to serve as caloric and nutritional filler took precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During research for the book, which includes recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period dish of roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t a popular addition to the dinner table,&quot; said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized, &quot;It was surreal.&quot;
Peanut butter and fried onions do not go together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, home economists—among them Louise Stanley, head of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—ruled the nation&#39;s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraged women to take the reins on the budget, and turned frills like creamy spaghetti with carrots into tasty meals.
The book &quot;A Square Meal&quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Desserts, in particular, originated as the government&#39;s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover&#39;s &quot;I&#39;ll have a pie&quot; pose.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he dined like the chosen millionaire he had become.
&quot;He liked to eat continental food like fish and gherkins,&quot; said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old fashioned.
President Roosevelt probably would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn&#39;t pushed him to lead by example with his own stomach.
As the book recounts, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste. This resulted in the White House being &quot;not only served almost the most dismal food in all of Washington, but also prepared in the most wretched manner.&quot;
A number of crisis-era eating habits disappeared as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy remains in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Miss Ziegelman&#39;s mother&#39;s eating habits - including why she couldn&#39;t throw away food.
&quot;She had a real fear of wasting food,&quot; said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman recalled, &quot;People were sick of her.&quot;
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg&#39;s tables were cleared, she and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
&quot;It&#39;s called plum cream,&quot; Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give elegant names to humble recipes.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly sank a spoon into the thick brown mass.
It was surprisingly bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more.
And, like a good householder, he said to his wife: &quot;We could do with a bit of mincemeat.&quot;
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who pour into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the series would look like if we shot them.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.
Using photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show how it would look like if famous series and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead awarded legal fees in anti-jaundice type C patent case against Merck
A district court judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement for attorneys&#39; fees it incurred in its anti-jaundice C patent lawsuit against drugmaker Merck &amp; Co Inc.
In June, a ruling that ordered Gilead to pay $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead&#39;s blockbuster drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, was overturned after a federal judge found repeated wrongdoing by Merck, among other lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in the filing Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming they owned the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead&#39;s drugs.
US-backed military forces say they have gained full control of the city of Manbij
US-backed military forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the border with Turkey, after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
The troops freed more than 2,000 civilians held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
&quot;The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,&quot; he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective tax rate of 34.2 percent.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees to the joint fund, and the former secretary of state acknowledged $3 million in income from Simon &amp; Schuster for her book about her time at the State Department.
Clinton&#39;s co-candidate, US Senator Tim Kaine from the state of Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, released their tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an actual tax of 20.3 percent.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be models of financial transparency,&quot; Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton&#39;s campaign, said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind false pretenses and backtracking on his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even though they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department&#39;s Internal Revenue Service as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
&quot;Your move,&quot; a Hillary Clinton campaign aide said on Twitter, following up on the Democratic nominee&#39;s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump&#39;s special counsel, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release the tax returns until the audits are completed.
Trump&#39;s critics, who include 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other GOP members, agree that his refusal raises questions about his net worth, charitable giving, business dealings and various other relationships, including with Russia .
Clinton is coming out strongly on the issue, releasing a video Friday in which she recalls how senior Republicans are pressing Trump to release his tax returns.
He will address the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan on Thursday.
&quot;He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done for decades — release his tax returns,&quot; she told People.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist cited a number of tax advisors and accountants who say that may still be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would make sure everyone who earns more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett&#39;s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, Buffett invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he has also been audited by the IRS and that Trump is &quot;not afraid&quot; of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons&#39; tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, they only have $100 in wages in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, from which the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from entering human dwellings - by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
This procedure has proven itself, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting this procedure and training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how to use this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops. without harming the animals.
Many of them used to use spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we&#39;ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to shine a flashlight on a passing elephant and sound the horn.
If he is not deterred, the so-called &quot;chili cloud&quot; will be thrown.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom together with the firecracker, its end is knotted so that only the wick is visible.
When detonated, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is sprayed into the air.
Most of the time, one puff is enough and the elephant will go in another direction.
The last option is to set off fireworks, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director slams Berlin hotel for removing code to call Israel at &#39;request&#39; of Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish descent has sparked a media frenzy after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have a code for calling Israel, according to a staff member at the &quot;request&quot; of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary &quot;Shoah&quot;, vented his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann was trying to find Israel in the hotel&#39;s dialing code list.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the option of calling Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The response he received &quot;shocked&quot; Lanzmann, he said.
A hotel employee replied that the measure was &quot;decided at the discretion of Kempinski Hotels management.&quot;
The reason for this move irritated the director even more.
&quot;Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the calling code for Israel be deleted,&quot; Lanzmann quoted the employee as saying in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel&#39;s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as &quot;a great shame.&quot;
We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a huge shame.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,&quot; he said.
The incident sparked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply got &quot;lost&quot; in the demands of Arab customers.
&quot;Shame on you,&quot; said another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the posh Kurfurstendamm, is not far from a synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly denied any accusations by calling the incident an &quot;oversight&quot; and &quot;apologising&quot; to Lanzman.
&quot;There was never a direct order&quot; not to include Israel in the list of calling codes, Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski hotel representative as saying.
It adds that the calling code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students and police clashed in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday as students gathered to demonstrate against the government&#39;s reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to voice their concerns about the plans.
Sao Paulo state governor Gerald Alckmin&#39;s proposals to save money also include closing nearly a hundred public schools and relocating 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spraying graffiti against interim president Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff as the country&#39;s senate decided to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year after the lifting of sanctions.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies doing business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are poised to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,&quot; said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia&#39;s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jump in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,&quot; the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly tourist visas.
Moreover, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be surpassed,&quot; he said.
At the same time, however, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
&quot;I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where there are well-preserved monuments of the ancient Persian civilization,&quot; he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner rushes home after Britain won gold in cycling
Scotland&#39;s Callum Skinner entered the men&#39;s team sprint hall of fame at the Rio Velodrome last night as Team GB&#39;s trio defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was in the role of brakeman for Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the youngster delighted the legend as he raced across the finish line to steal victory from favorites New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the track cycling world championships in March, although Hoy has since retired.
An issue between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialist opening competitor Jamie Staff.
So Hindes showed up just in time.
Hoye&#39;s departure also left a vacancy that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man for the British trainers and the search for potential was now confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years earlier - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the jersey in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his lap but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held on to the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going into a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator and kept his eyes on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they took to the podium.
Glasgow native Skinner, 23, said: &quot;It&#39;s a flattering comparison.&quot;
I&#39;m here to do my best and live up to my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoy in London 2012, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted the remark, leaving Britain&#39;s rivals with no recourse.
This time around this victory there was no such problem.
Hindes said: &quot;It felt like I was in London with all the British flags in the stands.&quot;
In the last three months, we have all come together as a team.
We&#39;ve lost a lot of world events, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
It&#39;s one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is any indication of progress over the past five months, then we are in for a successful five days at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny has shown, it is not inconceivable that he could repeat Hoya&#39;s feat and win three gold medals at the same Olympics.
That would make Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy to the day, also has a birthday on March 23 (the date seems sacred to British sport, with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrating their birthdays on this day) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy earned.
Next up, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I&#39;m enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win together with others.
To be honest, winning on your own is a bit lonely.
Hindes said: &quot;When he wins two more gold medals he should be knighted.&quot;
That was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest for the four kilometer team pursuit.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) take place on today&#39;s second day of racing, which Wiggins is sure to focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the stewards when the judges asked him to measure his height.
In the similar women&#39;s race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved a world record time of 4:13.260.
Relying on their strong track cycling squad, Team GB dominated the middle period of the Olympic Games and won plenty of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing complete dominance in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered during the build-up to Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of racing in the velodrome, it looks like Team Great Britain&#39;s legendary reputation for delivering top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of Portland smelter after power contract ends
The future of a Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt after the power plant that supplies the plant has announced the intention of one of the smelter&#39;s owners to end its electricity contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided earlier this year not to extend the subsidies that keep the business afloat.
The fixed twenty-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa Portland.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - could be at risk when it closes.
And since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria&#39;s total electricity generation, there could be further avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power station last year.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland smelter is underperforming and in danger of closing.
The move follows several years of speculation over the future of the business, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the plant&#39;s output prices.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with electricity from the Loy Yang A power station in the Latrobe Valley, said it expected one of the other three owners to also decide to end the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small trading shares held by China&#39;s CITIC and Japan&#39;s Marubeni Corp.
&quot;AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the smelter will continue,&quot; she said.
AGL said the contracts were so-called &quot;hedging contracts&quot; which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
&quot;AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings for fiscal 2017,&quot; the utility said.
Any potential impact on AGL&#39;s earnings from fiscal 2018 onwards is currently limited due to a strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts on its books of $187 million &quot;in the event of a termination.&quot;
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract &quot;has no impact on its ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supplies to the smelter.&quot;
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to start in November this year, although it has yet to explain why it backed out.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria as well as the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Stehpen Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these businesses were to withdraw from the market, it would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer,” he said.
Not only is Kendall the star of the Kardashians&#39; reality TV show - she&#39;s now on the cover of September&#39;s Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September edition of the American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, an Estee Lauder brand ambassador who has shown at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
&quot;In a room full of people I love, seeing this front page makes me want to cry,&quot; Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of Kardashian humor?) staged video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitly, along with everyone&#39;s favorite show business uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forget about their sister&#39;s envelope, just so the scene can end with a classic twist: they&#39;re preparing a secret party.
It&#39;s a played-out storyline in almost every &quot;birthday&quot; episode of a kids&#39; TV show (Seacrest says, &quot;Did you think we forgot about you?&quot; with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on an 8 a.m. show), but somehow Kris needed to make sure she could feed the other girls on this publicity.
Because if we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we have definitely entered a new era of the Kardashians.
Big sister Kim may have put Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine&#39;s September issue is in a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which in its thickness resembles more of a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a variety of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that of the 832 pages in last year&#39;s edition, 615 pages were advertising content).
The reveal of the star who will appear on the cover is eagerly awaited, so it&#39;s no wonder that in the past two years images of the magazine have been leaked before its official release.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more &quot;celebrities who model&quot; than &quot;models who are celebrities&quot; on the front page.
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, followed by Lagy Gaga a year later.
But while it&#39;s highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as a &quot;breakthrough model&quot; of her generation - will fall into the first category, she&#39;ll be in very good company.
These celebrities aren&#39;t relatives of famous people, or reality show stars, or kids today who know how to make a well-edited video (although Jenner represents all of that).
They are proven talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who graced the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is thrilled with Jenner&#39;s success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in reality shows.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria&#39;s Secret model, criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid in June, calling them &quot;whores of the moment.&quot;
Those feelings were reignited with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is misplaced.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She is modeling for Mark Jacobs.
He sells you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford&#39;s daughter, which she shot for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she acts in a reality show, perhaps only as a way to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centers turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are turned away from community legal aid centers each year and the sector itself is bracing for the effects of further cuts in funding to already overstretched services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the funds to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away when they seek free legal aid and representation .
Community legal services, already stretched to bursting, are set for further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers will lose an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
Queensland Community Legal Aid Center director James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers summary report found five thousand people are turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said unless the federal government&#39;s decision was overturned, the situation would only get worse.
&quot;Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,&quot; he said.
People who have escaped abusive relationships, people with excessive and crippling debt, families going through separation, workers who are being unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal proportions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which will mean thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will have to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We are calling on the Queensland State Representative and Senator George Brandis to stop this funding cut immediately so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the state government lived up to its commitment to ensure funding of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and their client communities and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump&#39;s campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after being told a North Carolina operations director pointed a gun at a staffer during a Jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court filing filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software trainer in the state.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that &quot;it wasn&#39;t going to happen.&quot;
Principal Earl Phillip &quot;pointed his fingers at the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent&#39;s kneecap,&quot; Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The filing states that after complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordini discovered that at least four other people had experienced the same thing as Phillip.
&quot;Guns do not have to fire to cause harm,&quot; Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners (which are regulated in the U.S. Constitution&#39;s Second Amendment) could step in if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, is elected and will be able to appoint its own judges.
Trump&#39;s campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump was not advocating violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini is seeking damages from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of force and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip for comment were unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A phone call to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered within a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotta).
Britain needs to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of regeneration and prosperity not just for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow has a huge appeal, just as London 2012 did, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our nations and regions could benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics have brought enormous benefits to both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport for our local communities alone.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who think the Heathrow expansion is too much.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be laughed at on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and in the case of Heathrow they will be proven wrong.
There will always be hurdles to overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, leaving a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered an £11bn infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, from Terminal T5 - which has been voted the best terminal in the world five years running, to Terminal T2 which has been built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway worth £16bn of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for Great Britain and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion will be as well.
It&#39;s time we continued to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing trade for the future and leaving a legacy of skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board and formerly Under Secretary of State for Trade at the Treasury.
Adblock Plus - Facebook&#39;s ad-blocking cat-and-mouse game
Trying to get around ad-blocking programs has become a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that&#39;s what one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site saying users can update their program&#39;s filters and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it harder for ad filters to figure out which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that they have already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that &quot;this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to get around it has been going on since ad blocking was invented,&quot; and that Facebook is likely to come up with another of its own repair.
The fact that the company that owns the world&#39;s largest social network has joined the war just goes to show how big of a problem ad blocking has become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad filters - almost four times more than in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
However, a spokesperson said the company opposes desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters don&#39;t work on mobile apps for the social network and Instagram.
Desktop ads are still profitable enough for Facebook to invest in them.
Facebook also said Tuesday that it will update its &quot;ad preferences&quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said it was concerned about Adblock&#39;s new filters because they could also block non-advertising content on sites.
&quot;This is not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to fix the problem,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we&#39;ve preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that put people in control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses to the incident in which a woman was run over by several cars on the highway in the early hours of Thursday morning, who probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police said in a statement that the &quot;desperate act&quot; actress was lying on the road in the dark and was run over by several cars.
It is understood the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a lorry.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but police say not all of them have yet been identified. Police are urging those drivers and anyone else who witnessed the crash to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a &quot;logical&quot; step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Could the collision have been avoided?
That&#39;s for the prosecutor to find out,&quot; Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, it appears that the drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which involved a person walking on the highway - it was ruled that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of manslaughter charges after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard the victim, aged 22, had been drinking alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the female police officer - who was responding to the emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was a &quot;completely exceptional and unforeseeable situation&quot;, the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday&#39;s incident at Morges should contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (AČCKA) expects that up to 20,000 visitors will come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
The executive director of the AČCKA, Kateřina Petříčková, announced this on Friday.
The sixth year of Prague Pride started on August 8, the festival brings the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT) closer.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
&quot;Prague is one of the most popular destinations for the LGBT community, due to its high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses,&quot; said Petříčková.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3,100 crowns per person per day.
Special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague&#39;s gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications etc. are available to gay tourists to support their travel.
&quot;For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, they are interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spend more than others,&quot; said Petříčková.
As part of the festival program, the first Pride Tourism Symposium is also taking place this year.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China will give lectures.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be a traditional procession with allegorical chariots on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The parade, which has attracted thousands of people in previous years, will observe a minute&#39;s silence this year for the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where an assailant shot and killed 49 people, mostly gay people.
Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
The irrepressible DIYers Pat and Mat, whose endeavors usually end in disaster, have been entertaining audiences young and old for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series directed by Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, were the cartoon jokes of artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for the magazine with two handymen Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited dramaturg Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to cooperate, and together they created the film Kuťáci.
The characters got their present appearance with a yellow and red trick and beanie and a radio in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in the Short Film Praha.
The do-it-yourselfers were given the names Pat and Mat in 1985, this time shooting directly for the Short film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own animated film studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, Beneš&#39;s son Marek took part in many of them.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these DIYers, who have everything falling under their hands, but they never get angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and in the end they are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the well-known gesture &quot;... and it is done!&quot;.
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and the theater, and figures or other toys with the image of Pat and Mat are a hit in every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmonia.
The end of the week is marked by fairy tales, we have chosen for you one from sports and one from life.
Both have a good ending.
So let&#39;s take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what things do people spend the most on at airports?
That&#39;s Friday&#39;s overview from the world&#39;s websites.
First Olympic medal.
The island nation of Fiji is celebrating a historic success.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the team of Great Britain in the final of the Olympic rugby sevens tournament.
It is the first ever medal that Fiji has won at the Olympics.
The wait for the first precious metal took sixty years since the first expedition was sent to the Olympic Games.
Much of the credit for the success goes to Fiji&#39;s coach.
Ironically, however, it is Britain&#39;s Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
&quot;Let&#39;s play loose and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history,&quot; the coach said before the final.
In the end, Fiji sovereignly controlled it, and the small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now living an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs since 11 months, got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
&quot;Mommy, she&#39;s just like me,&quot; the two-year-old girl rejoiced, her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to remove the doll&#39;s arms and legs and then sit together without the prosthetics.
Harmonia was diagnosed with meningitis type B when she was less than a year old, doctors gave her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There is nothing I don&#39;t love about her.
She is beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He also has an overview.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words Hi, I&#39;m Harmonie and I have no hands, added the mother.
Look at the joy the doll caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
CNN reports that people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
The Hudson&#39;s travel essential stores chain has published data for the past year, which summarizes the 10 products that customers buy most often in its stores at airports.
Water was supremely first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
Ninth place was taken by a large package of coconut-flavored M&amp;M candies.
And can you guess who rounds out the top ten?
It is the only one of the above things that cannot be eaten.
According to CNN, it&#39;s The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We&#39;re just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have reigned supreme in the doubles category without a coxswain for seven years and confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the mismatched pair switched to a smaller crew after the Olympics in Beijing and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday&#39;s final.
How are we different from others?
We are simply prettier, Murray joked already during the Olympic regatta, when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Honestly, we don&#39;t do anything different than others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we&#39;re constantly trying to improve our technique, that&#39;s our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is an almost two-meter and one hundred-kilogram lad, the academic-looking Bond is five centimeters shorter and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has, for example, a charity boxing match.
Because of this, they don&#39;t spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric comes on board basically saying we can&#39;t lose.
We&#39;re just going to win.
I tend to think about what can go wrong, admitted Bond, who clearly demonstrated at the press conference that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer and Bond waited for his opportunity.
On the water, however, he destroys his opponents with calm power.
They eat their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead halfway through the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go all the way for the first kilometer.
We&#39;re just trying to drive a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said the 34-year-old Murray.
With his partner four years younger, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the golden four without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Olympics in Beijing a year later that they decided to switch to the two without a helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, they apparently atoned for the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us and they didn&#39;t ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be bloody tough and we had to make sure we were mentally fit, said Murray.
We know they all want to dethrone us.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA&#39;s new climate model projections, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, devoid of water and saturated with CO2, may once have had conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus&#39;s slow rotation rate could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it appears that Venus once boasted a thin Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also looked at the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet likely had areas drier than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic diversity to support life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to also use the Sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
&quot;In the GISS model simulation, Venus exposes its day side to the sun for nearly two months at a time during its slow rotation,&quot; explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and rain forms, which creates a thick layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than Earth&#39;s present day.
The model constructed a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and the water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped, leaving only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, a deadly greenhouse gas -- that&#39;s Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from a new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing the inability to participate in the decision-making process on team matters.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
&quot;For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,&quot; Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I thought long and hard over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations align with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that impact the team&#39;s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who welcomed Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
&quot;Patrick informed me of his decision today,&quot; Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award as the league&#39;s top coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division. But Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has consistently missed the postseason over the past two years.
The Avalanche went 39-39-4 in 2015/2016 and fell five points short of the second wild card in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and call off strike
Senior officials of the negotiating parties said strikes over wages for North Sea oil rig workers were on hold while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have occurred sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
&quot;Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current disagreements,&quot; it said in a statement.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day-long meetings over the next few weeks where we will try to look at the issues from new angles.
According to unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is to protest pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less this year due to negative market pressure.
The cut in company rates follows a 10 per cent cut for offshore companies in 2014.
The company says further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to exit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernize its processes - on the heels of a mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, an economic situation linked to Britain&#39;s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in a generation, which led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region&#39;s economy.
&quot;In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,&quot; he said in a statement.
By comparison, nearly $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope&#39;s latest mission to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotation rates of the stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different rates, as well as how the rotation period relates to planet formation.
&quot;By comparing our results with other star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star&#39;s mass, its age, and even its history in its solar system,&quot; Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech&#39;s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in the new report.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just reaching maturity and have formed over about 125 million years.
Now it spins the fastest.
At moments of maximum rotation rates, these teenage stars release enormous amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the stars&#39; magnetic fields, they have a slowing effect on them.
As a star ages, its rotation rate slows down.
Kepler measures each star&#39;s rotation rate by measuring the time between the appearance of recognizable spots on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotation rates, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebullová compares stars to dancers, bigger ones do pirouettes more slowly than smaller ones.
&quot;In the &#39;ballet&#39; of the Pleiades, we see that the slower-spinning stars are more massive, while the fastest-spinning ones tend to be very light stars,&quot; Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing star quality and rotation rates.
&quot;The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,&quot; said Rebull.
There is still much we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rate and &quot;hang up their dancing shoes&quot; so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades in three studies to be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I did not sign up, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and I could transfer to another hospital after a few months?
Is it even possible to work after completing your studies without enrolling in specialized education?
The issue for me is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is currently a vacancy only in a hospital somewhat further away, but in about six months a position could become available in another where I would then like to work.
So I have no idea how to solve the situation for about six months, the question continues.
It is answered by Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legal regulation stipulates the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labor Code, and it can be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the return of the costs incurred in connection with increasing or deepening the employee&#39;s qualifications.
In the field of health care, there is long-term pressure not to conclude these agreements with regard to ensuring the work mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognizing professional competence and specialized competence to perform the medical profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly stated that participation in specialized education is considered to deepen the qualification (not to increase it ).
This means that, according to the Labor Code, a qualification agreement can only be concluded if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
No legal regulation even stipulates the obligation to register for specialized education.
The law only stipulates the conditions of the application for inclusion in the field of specialized education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to practice the profession of a doctor already by completing the necessary university studies, albeit under the conditions set by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The law foresees a situation where professional practice completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialized education of a doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
In theory, it would thus be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer&#39;s situation.
However, considering the fact that I do not know the specific circumstances of this case, it is recommended to consult with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health provides by law an advisory and consulting service related to inclusion in specialized education and its course.
The consulting service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Syria&#39;s Halab are asking for US intervention.
The United States made no effort to end the siege (of the rebel-held part of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, AFP quoted the letter to the White House as saying.
&quot;We don&#39;t need tears, sympathy, or even prayers; however, we desperately need a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again,&quot; the doctors said.
Russian forces backing an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have announced they will halt strikes in the Aleppo area for three hours each day from today to allow safe passage for aid convoys.
From 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 CEST, all military activities, airstrikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
The head of UN humanitarian operations, Stephen O&#39;Brien, welcomed it, but stressed that at least a two-day ceasefire was needed.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of Aleppo, which is already controlled by the rebels, turned to Obama in the letter.
They write that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks on and notes how complicated Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like thinly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria have been recorded in the past month, including 15 on the hospitals where they work.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Small children come to our emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don&#39;t even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They gasped, and then their life was over - before it could really begin, they reminded.
An army loyal to President Bashar Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes from the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the encirclement and launch a counter-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then received reinforcements in and around the city.
