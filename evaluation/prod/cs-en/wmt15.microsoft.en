Petr Cech: Last minute transfer?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance will come in winter.
Petr Cech, currently Chelsea's substitute goalkeeper, is not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting in the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talking to Czech journalists and preparing with the Czech national team for a game dress rehearsal with the Americans and then also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea goal, Thibaut Courtois is preferred in the new Premier League season, the Czech for the first time in ten years in the London club got into the position of a substitute.
Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Cech.
At the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in battles with Atlético and did not manage to start the league season, losing 2: 4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He started the French league season with two wins and two draws, beating St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
Relatively speaking, AS Monaco is pushing the shoe the most.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and parted ways with Lille amicably 1-1 at the weekend.
On the English tabloid websites today popped up news that the Czech could be wanted at Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Cech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet offered odds of 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your jersey in the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but nothing is ever foolproof in football.
Maybe during the day an offer will come that cannot be refused.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know what an offer like that doesn't look like.
First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position, whether the club would deal with a possible offer or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a possible new contract somewhere in your new location?
I didn't think about it that way.
But there are a lot of players in such a situation today, they are all somewhere at national team meetings and certainly a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So somehow feasible it would certainly be.
How many clubs are there on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
And you're not pushing to leave?
The situation where I did not play in the first three games of the new season is new for me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to be involved in this battle for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper and it is up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he makes in the coming weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all factors into account.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family naturally belong.
Is it possible that you would play for another club in England?
This is a question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meeting in Tokyo

According to the rapporteurs, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a twenty-year-old youth after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it sped 125 km/h through a 70 km/h zone and drove into the bush to escape the police.
Traffic police on patrol in Karrata tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the side of the road in the morning when they noticed it was driving at 125 km/h at the exit of a petrol station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into the bush, leaving him out of sight.
The motorbike and a person matching the driver's description were then spotted at a home in Walcott Way, Bulgara.
Karrath police charged a twenty-year-old with disobeying a stop call and careless driving.
He will appear in court in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was impounded for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will stand trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was made aware of the allegations during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman on 7 June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while "she was unconscious, asleep, and in no condition to give her consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a trial date of November 17 at the Edinburgh High Court.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to protect union organizing as a civil right.
"The way unions work, middle-class jobs work," said Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who is co-chair of a congressional committee.
That is why I am so proud to introduce a law empowering employees, along with John Lewis, a model of occasional rights.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in unionisation as in other forms of discrimination – and stop anti-union forces
Amending the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join a trade union to sue in a civil court - and to seek compensation or damages - is a right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors are proposing in the bill is to rebuild the American ideal.
Despite union struggles in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states — Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember, when the country championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toya was replaced by democracy.
Convinced that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they incorporated language into them and openly acknowledged that "the right of workers to assemble, bargain collectively, and negotiate is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans, realizing that the workers would need to organize and assert themselves in the new nation, included a clause that openly stated: "The right to form associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements that restrict this right or seek to infringe it will be repealed. Measures to fulfil such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the proponents and Roosevelt included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labor unions—and their participation in collective bargaining with firms and government agencies as equal partners—must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is imperative to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and assert themselves in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions did not diminish the strength of the nation, but expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restore the ideals that lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked a law that could have closed all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The order, enacted by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's signature in June, which is set to take effect on Sept. 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to admit a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain that permission in the meantime.
"The petitioning party will be able to lawfully conduct its business and in the meantime obtain a permit," federal Judge John deGravelles said in a ruling.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month to allow the judge to issue a more permanent order on the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a sneaky bill designed to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sued on behalf of three of the five clinics to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs and were also applying for permission.
Louisiana is among eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would have closed most of the state's remaining clinics were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Women's abortion rights campaigners, along with the Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of America and the American Medical Association, argue that requiring such a permit places medically unnecessary requirements on physicians.
Abortion opponents countered that the measures were intended to protect women's health, and some welcomed the fact that the measures would close clinics.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said only one abortion doctor in Louisiana is authorized.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while they wait for a rights application to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, rural-grade ovarian cancer kills more frequently
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video paying tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their urban counterparts.
Researchers analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said women's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status all affected the chances of survival.
The lowest survival rates were found in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study wasn't designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says late diagnosis and poor access to treatment may be factors.
"The disease is best treated by gyneco-oncologists, who are usually based in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements to distance medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that strengthening transport services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far from their family and friends would help.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival for women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geography, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mom named Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with an extraordinary decline in homeowners under 35 could lead to garden centres losing up to ten million pounds a year when today's young generation of consumers reach the "main age group of gardeners".
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on average 55% of what people who live in their own homes spend on their gardens.
Other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, include an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking areas and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, the lowest expenditure on horticultural products per household is in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said sublet housing or lack of space doesn't mean people can't grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser for the RHS, said: "Growing potted plants is very popular with tenants – when they move they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 80s to the mid-90s.
He also forecast higher sales for this year due to better weather following unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When an Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After he rattled nuclear weapons at a meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, and basically let everyone know that their views were stolen from him, Putin gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both extreme nationalism and can transform an inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to flow differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars for domination of Europe was long gone, in the East, on the contrary, they think that they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the thirties, just before the Nazis seized power, and then followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike the situation in Russia today.
And then the identical cult of a strong leader, beating up journalists, liquidating inconvenient political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, it is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of Russians, probably misses the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Perhaps Western politicians were themselves to blame, maybe they patted Vladimir on the back enough, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted, and maybe they started to underestimate him and he just behaved like a typical Russian muzhik.
He put his house in order, pretended that he didn't really want to go anywhere, and sharpened knives at home.
Now he has decided to regain his lost positions.
He starts slowly, he has time.
He is probably a leader for life, so where would he hurry?
He trampled the Caucasians, now he tramples the Ukrainians, then it is the turn of the dwarfs from the Baltics.
They have been pinching the Russian bear in its fur coat long enough.
This will certainly be noticed by China, which is jumping too much and is certainly interested in the Far East.
And the Germans also annoy Vladimír how well they are doing, and we gave them a kick on their ass when they were 45.
How about making one new Novorosiya in Karlovy Vary.
That would be a base and there are a lot of ours and as they oppress them and the dacha they already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he is so soft, you can peel like an onion and eat their whole EU.
That would make them jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of their place.
And as detonators we will use our compatriots who live on their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and if you say that they are oppressed there, they are simply oppressing them there, and we will not leave it at that, we will protect them.
And again the Russian will rule, for what else is he born for?
After all, Europe is only good as a preposition on which proud Ivan can dance the Cossack.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign minister summoned the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report, which said German intelligence had also targeted Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones introduced more four-season tricks
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth season of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth season were created.
The most obvious are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scene, when a group of soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
On Friday, the applicants submitted evidence of blackmail by police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the municipality of Calvia to the Mallorcan Public Prosecutor's Office.
The police chief in Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested following allegations brought by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightlife venues are located, brought corruption charges against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, on Friday the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and civil servants of the Calvia municipality to the prosecutor of Mallorca's anti-corruption office.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police in connection with corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
Spain's national daily ABC quoted disgruntled nightclub owners as saying that favouritism by public officials has serious implications for their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video of an eighteen-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour appeared on YouTube.
The island's authorities have since tried to keep an eye on drunks and rioters among the partygoers in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex incident took place, was forced to close for a year and, along with the bar tour organizers Carnage, was fined 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with Britons, has also witnessed many drunk accidents, including a fashion wave known as "balconing," in which people jump from one balcony to another or from balcony into the hotel's swimming pool.
First day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that impacted the flight at Adelaide airport
SPRING brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds that severely hit Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of rainfall is expected in the city until nine o'clock in the evening, and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced along with several short showers associated with thunderstorms and gusts of wind that began before eight o'clock in the evening and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring arrived after winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again to just 15.8C on Monday.
Thunderstorm weather is believed to have contributed to Virgin Airlines' delayed arrival from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19:30, but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction for short distances and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at the airport in Adelaide reached speeds of around 50 km/h on the ground at that time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to abandon the second landing and finally touched down at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay subsequently caused delays to other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide temperatures are forecast to reach a maximum of 16C on Tuesday and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the fifty-day war between Israel and Hamas. But schools in Gaza remain closed as the territory recovers from the fighting.
The start of school has brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel scarred by the attacks, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, employees of a kindergarten hit by a rocket have removed shrapnel from a wall and are slowly awaiting the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was "a bit strange" to suddenly go back to school.
"We had a couple of tough times and didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is close to the Gaza border, to offer his support to the population.
Until a ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes for safer areas further from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The education minister said about a dozen families had still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in foster schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study hard, adding, "We will provide you with education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite peace.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate cessation of hostilities, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures, estimating that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country, during the fighting.
The Israeli military, for its part, has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli strikes have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in a hundred UN schools, which have been turned into makeshift shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in hiding and ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education just like Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a thirteen-year-old boy from a school in Gaza's largest city.
Vrba at the meeting: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafata suffers from temperature
The Czech national football team met today before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualification against the Netherlands.
From the twenty-three-member cadre has problems Sparta striker David Lafata, who suffers from temperature.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David still has a little bit of problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible, "said coach Pavel Vrba.
"Whether it will be two or three days, or whether he will be fit tomorrow, will be seen according to his state of health, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it's not like they can't train or participate in the match on Wednesday with the USA," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player Sparta midfielder Lukas Vácha.
He admitted it was not an easy decision, with other midfielders also considered.
I decided based on the fact that Lukas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very complicated, but I stand by it, "said Vrba to Vácha.
And what about Šural?
We'll see what happens with Latata
It is not excluded that in case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
At the weekend, for example, Liberec's Josef Šural, who scored a hattrick, flashed with a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We'll see how David Lafata does.
If he can not be available on Wednesday, I do not say that I can not nominate one of the players who have caught the attention of the Czech league, "said Vrba.
This afternoon, the national team will train at Strahov, on Tuesday there will be a classic pre-match training before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday at 20:15 and the national team will strive for the first victory under Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9 at 20:45.
Pešice goes to Italy for the Dutch
Vrba is glad that he has more time for training, unlike previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we didn't have so much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands in the best possible way, "said Vrba.
The Dutch will play in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national coach Josef Pešice.
He will give us information that is from the match.
But it's not just going to be about him, we'll have the match filmed and we'll break it down.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there, "said Vrba to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to closely watched statistics, apartment prices in winter have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic index of apartment values in Australia, housing prices rose 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price increases climbed to 10.9%, more than double in the one year to August 2013, but profits were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne lead the market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney apartment prices rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which has been hurt by state-mandated spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the persistently high auction sell-off rate, the generally high rate of sales and the low interest rate, housing values are likely to increase further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said to me, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958, one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19 and who worked in a factory, had a cooler relationship.
Henry tries out a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "thorough" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — they were adults when I was a kid — used to go to a bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of hitting in cricket.
I've never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he's been a serious guy in the corner reading newspapers.
Recently, Henry visited a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he got a glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad would always get into the bathtub and just lie there, then you could hear him slowly starting to sing to himself because he was washing the foundry off of himself.
As I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to support his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite this, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying to each other, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you" now?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
He and French, to whom he was married for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes started to show, the doctor would tell me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tedious.
No one wants to eat carrots alone.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cropped beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
This was followed by a Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent competition.
His television career began in the mid-70s: "For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television."
He learned as he went.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985 I had to learn how to make jokes that work, be a star and be on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in the New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the rights to stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed up as black men, Henry ended up appearing in it for five years with his comedy.
My family was already uncomfortable because of it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "years and years of award-winning major product of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
In the 80s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, introducing characters that both mocked and glorified British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 90s he was best known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
He spent the next decade doing commercials, documentaries, TV series and movie roles, but after his series aired LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "So what are you going to do now, Len, it looks a bit like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little bit out of your way."
Next up was a Radio 4 documentary called What's So Great About...? /What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was seriously allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had delivered twenty lines from Othello's closing speech for the documentary, and he was already at it.
It gave me the feeling that I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's about it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the rehearsals were hard, and before that I had been reading the play for months and months.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in trouble, which didn't happen.
He soon began acting in a Comedy Full of Errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for entertaining the audience.
"A voice in my head said, 'Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes.'"
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would resume once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can sort it out for me.
"You're acting, so stay in the role."
Henry in the Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of Fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a divine sign that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a RESONANT voice.
So I'm sticking with that.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry, however, remains the brain of a comedian - the whole time he interrupts our conversation with humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I guess.
If you're always looking for something, you can reach a dead end.
Sometimes I do Live at the Apollo when I want to, but I don't enjoy it as much as I used to.
I asked if he would ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps outline the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You're always telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving their paychecks.
The government believes that thousands of people are still being paid after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to crack down on corruption in the civil service.
An audit carried out earlier this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars (£700,000) a month in salaries for non-existent employees and other abuses of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after the employee leaves the civil service, said the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reporter in the capital Nairobi.
All civil servants must report to identification centers within the next two weeks where their data will be biometrically recorded, a government statement said.
It goes on to say that anyone who fails to show up without sufficient excuse will be removed from the payroll.
"By identifying genuine public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its rationalization and will also be used to clean up payrolls at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for 'conspiracy' against government
Local media reported that a total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government."
The police office has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were implicated in a corruption investigation in December that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time prime minister) described their actions as part of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen's work against him and others in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held the traditional ceremony on September 1.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will acquire knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children putting on embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It carries with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the Conservative Party.
She has experience on the front lines.
She began her career at Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when her younger colleague filled the top job at Pearson's.
It is said that her severance payment was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inwards to the upper echelons of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also out to voice the public in times of unrest when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires thorough reform.
But what CEO would risk coming into a company as complex as a Chinese dynasty, dismantling it, and thus putting himself out of work?
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and its status revised.
As competition expands and new technology challenges old certainties, imminent negotiations on licence fees carry great danger for the BBC.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is surely the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, costing each just 40 pence a day.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, up from 31% a decade ago.
The models of using BBC services have changed: Today, I see headlines on my mobile phone and I can watch the shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a much-loved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he did not approve of the offensive tweet
A tweet from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's official Twitter account, released Sunday, contained an offensive image of the Democratic prosecutor who initiated the criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry's account that distanced himself from the previous one.
A tweet left my account that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and have withdrawn it," he said in another post.
Perry's aides did not immediately respond to messages with questions.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who is actually responsible for managing it.
A previous tweet posted an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay out funds to her office, bringing Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election, before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption in the tweet read: "I don't always drive with blood alcohol levels three times the legal limit... but if I do, I'm going to sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because using the law to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the Travis County-based Public Interest Division prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civil society activists.
Perry's official account is active — and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might quit by tweeting a photo of himself jogging near a lake and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to "normal"
One of London's most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital has been subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley, a development firm for demanding clients, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from a peak in 2013 to normal transaction levels." He adds that this provides a "stable environment for functioning."
London's housing market did well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to data from the Land Registry, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, London property has not been as attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "residence tax" that politicians have come up with ahead of next May's general election.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that April's mortgage market review, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow the market's pace of growth in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in mortgage approvals for the month of July, suggesting the housing market is calming.
Hamptons International, another estate agency, has lowered its forecast for London property prices to rise to 3% in 2015 on the basis that house prices have already started to fall.
Meanwhile, transaction volumes in London's most expensive boroughs such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have fallen by a quarter each year, according to real estate agency WA Ellis.
Still, demand for housing in the capital was a boon for Berkeley, as it raised cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same and as a result, forward sales have been maintained."
In June, the firm reported selling 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased 40% to £380 million and revenue up 18% to £1.6 billion.
Ahead of the company's annual meeting, Pidgley said Berkeley's annual returns are forecast to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Hacker posted nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the "Hunger Games" star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for an "obvious violation of privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker allegedly obtained the photos, which were originally posted on image-sharing site 4chan, through a loophole in Apple's iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims includes the names of dozens of stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's unclear how many photos are authentic, but "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" star Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who are looking at the photos my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our homes are happy with yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from cable TV series Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied the photos were genuine. She tweeted: "These alleged nude photos of me are FAKE, folks."
Better to cut it off in the heyday. *intentional pun*.
Buzzfeed reported Sunday night that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually disintegrating like a cardboard box that someone had left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complex, violent, isolated, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it irritably.
He could prick, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was an incipient love affair that promised more than usual to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fickle heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came south with an elderly companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited a fortune in a damp but beautiful valley called, fittingly, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs had signed their names on the windows as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, frightening and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to a public station that supplied the county with comforting music and soothing news, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian whom his father loved to listen to with his blinds drawn.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't banned - nothing was really forbidden - they just weren't played.
They helped them get into desuetudo, as well as the very word desuetudo.
Folk taste has done what regulations and outlaws could never do, and just as people choose memoirs in which a poor man becomes rich, cookbooks and romance novels, so in music ballads are chosen.
Getting carried away by the day, the cavern began to play an imaginary piano, singing a serenade to Aillina's big feet in a rough, comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was little.
His father told him that he had played the game with his father.
If you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth at a word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard one.
Even jazz, although not directly outlawed, was not played.
Improvisation went out of fashion.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
When the melody started playing, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was humor expressed in song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
Also without laws or coercion.
A compliant society is one in which every part of it agrees with gratitude—with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately spared—the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were temperamentally and constitutionally suited for entertainment and athleticism, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, as if naturally gifted for electronics, took responsibility for ensuring that no family would be without a working phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks who remained washed the dishes.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly while WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED - they were afraid of being accused of putting it in the fire, in fact they were afraid that the fire would consume them next time - they opened restaurants where labneh was sold and hookahs were smoked, they did not draw attention to themselves and inactivity slowly consumed them.
To each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn had a hard time understanding how the swear words Kavern had just sung to her could become music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought she was funny," he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief, obscuring Kevern's view.
Nothing could be seen in the whole wide world but the tangle of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked genuinely upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not really.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate?
This is not true.
It's just a silly song.
He could have told her, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your fat ankles just attract me," he tried.
I'm kind of a pervert.
That failed.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the charm necessary to tame the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Perhaps he was deliberately cruel to the Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from the lounger, threw down the radio, and spilled the half-finished wine.
Elderberry wine, so the drink was not to blame.
She seemed to tremble in her agitation, like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm perversely attracted to the fact that you're a jerk," she said.
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both because of her unkind words and because of the fear in her eyes when she confronted him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She hadn't talked to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she'd grown up, but he had no doubt that the basics were the same there as they were here.
The same vast and icy ocean was shattering against them.
The same demented men, after WHAT HAD HAPPENED, even more touchy and sullen than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, wandered angrily from tavern to tavern, ready to lay hands on any woman who dared to reject or laugh at them.
Idiot?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First cuddle her—cuddle became the most common term for erotic teasing between a man and a woman: the antidote to the faint love ballads that the radio churned out—first cuddling her, then murdering her.
In Kevern's opinion, excessive sophistication, because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons non-verbally signaled for him to leave.
He rose from the couch like an old man.
She felt annoyed herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him go—as if watching him from an upstairs window—a man caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart sank for him and for all men in general, regardless of the fact that a few had beaten her.
The man turned away from her, shoulders slumped, ashamed, defeated, all his fighting spirit left him—why did she seem to know this sight well, though she couldn't remember a single moment, until today, that she'd ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
Some twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic thirty-two-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, the non-statutory monitoring system of Public Sentiment, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where it was most expected to be mitigated or outright stopped if enough money and energy were spent on its removal.
"Much has been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the remote, hard-to-reach parts of the country where, despite the tips of church spires rising above the hedgerows, a touch of human kindness has historically rarely appeared."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It would seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the puds.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories, and claim to believe firmly in the value of marriage and family life, but not only is the old brutality as stubbornly held on in rural areas as it is in urban areas, but evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, on roads, and even on sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery," her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again protested her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I have anything against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have done.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the Church – things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still dealing with WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, is preparing the earth with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head, a recommendation that Ofnow had been broadcasting to the world for the past quarter of a century or more flashed pink on the scoreboard.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than being silent, the sung word is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, when she was sure her superior was finished, "and I no longer claim that the wound did not heal as we would have us believe it did.
My main concern is that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IT HAD HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected with his fingertips.
This was supposed to indicate infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that your grandparents may have taken and may not have taken as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about venting their "anger" and "distrust" of "others."
I should not remind anyone in your position that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "us" and there was no "them."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we're honest with ourselves," Esme summoned up the courage, "no one is blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
There is nothing more to say about this - we agree on this.
And just as there is no blame to blame on anyone, there are no things to be corrected, even if correction were appropriate and possible.
But what good is the past but to learn from it -
The past exists for us to forget.
If I may add anything to that -
Luther Rabinowitz disconnected his fingertips.
"I will take your report into account," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, as she was walking to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the pavement in what passersby described as "brutal and furious."
Coincidences happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says it is not planning a coup - the prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officers from the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government and say they acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After saying he had received death threats, the prime minister and his family left for neighbouring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but a response by the army to a threat from "political fanatics" that police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the command of the Defense Forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were several groups in the ranks of the police who were planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to wreak havoc in the country," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of the Lesotho defense forces appear to bear the hallmarks of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was under attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been rife in Lesotho since Thabane suspended parliament in June due to internal disputes.
He said that despite claims to the contrary, his actions did not undermine the government.
Manufacturing in the euro area is at a thirteen-month low
Manufacturing growth in the euro area slowed to a thirteen-month low in August, according to a closely watched survey.
The euro area's final purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in June.
A number higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have dwindled and factories have been hurt by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone's delayed recovery and the threat of deflation, with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to the one the UK and the US have undertaken during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth, the drag effect that a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty is having on manufacturers is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an eleven-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, while Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the growth drivers in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
An industrial slowdown is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting further monetary or tax stimulus to be implemented.
One piece of positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the Purchasing Managers' Manufacturing Report for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "Eurozone producers are currently having a very difficult life, as rising geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add even more uncertainty to the still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably hit trade - particularly consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially costly ones.
He said it seemed "even more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of Beslan survivors' hell: Ten years after the horrors of the occupied school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, a thousand people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
During the ordeal that lasted three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of a school in Beslan that killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night the surviving heroes warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance over the tragedy united East and West, which in this catastrophic disaster led to action and a future.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted adversity, even though the memory of the hell caused by terrorists lives on in them.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
A girl trying to climb back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov in his underwear trying to climb back into the bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded inside it.
Confused, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
It was feared that both were dead, but in fact they survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to find my mother.
She was saved by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another operation.
Pieces of shrapnel remained in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said firmly.
"It just happened to me and you can't change that.
Once a year I go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Djera Gapoeva was killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at a picture of myself climbing through a school window on the Internet, I tell myself that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the catastrophe and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped through a rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and he survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said: "Mum told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She told him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a toddler crying on the way, grabbed the child's hand and they ran away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother is dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with an injured leg, thinking that her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran inside and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are already fading.
I remember that right after that I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the children I played with in the yard who didn't get out.
We will never say that they killed them or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in a toy store and how I drove a convertible.
But now he worries about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffered because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
"I feel terribly sorry for everyone who has to go through such horror," says Damir, who volunteered at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work in the police one day and I hope to be accepted into the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: "They killed 37 children in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children screaming and running, and the silence lasted for several months.
He vividly remembers a trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember Damir had a taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol and they ran and played with him.
And it was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think that many children have been and will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not want revenge, he is not interested in this at all.
I know he doesn't like to think about it, but he's very close to six classmates and from time to time he goes to the gym and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying down on the couch with his face turned away from us, and sometimes lying like that for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he threw away all his pistols or other toy weapons. Damir is 17 today, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy had no chance of surviving this hell.
"I remember shouting 'Damir, run, run!' but I was convinced he hadn't heard me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life, unlike others, goes further.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, Grigoriy on the right today
As he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot dead his classmates, fear was etched in his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and hurried to drive her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists burst into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days," she recalled.
Not completely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigoriy survived.
As that date approaches, it becomes harder to think about and talk about it.
Not a day goes by without remembering that tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Recurring memories: The photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigoriy was really looking forward to going to school, saying that he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of a weeping Grigory in San Marino.
Grigoriy doesn't like to look at the photo, and we have it hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of that picture, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigoriy says: "The important thing is that this does not happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but the truth will never be known.
Now they are investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
Something very bad awaits this world.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget at least a little, it takes decades.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
For three or four years I had nightmares about the attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates they had killed.
Therefore, when September 1 approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is in the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of my health I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I won't be able to.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The Boy Who Survived Despite Being Held at the Feet of a Murderous Terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gymnasium, sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle that he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service but could not because of the injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw behind me.
I'm older now and it is said that children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that this is not true.
"I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I re-entered the gym.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sit in that familiar picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I injured, but I can walk normally.
But even so, due to my health, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I joined the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said: "I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something children should know about, and certainly not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain will always be there.
It's inside and gets worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will attend the commemoration ceremonies.
I know that Grigoriy will not go.
It has to be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he gave it back to me. Here in Beslan, traces are everywhere.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult now, but he carries the horror on.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several surgeries, he can walk, but he can not exercise.
I would say that 50% of the time he has overcome the horror, but you can't overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and that is the greatest gift God could give me, but I am hurt by the loss of those killed.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight each other now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could pick up all those rebels and throw them away - as far as we could.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who was carried to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is being carried to safety by a Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory of the tragedy
The world gasped in 2004 when little Alyona was carried in his arms from Beslan captivity by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but kept her thirty-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in captivity in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a baby girl, whom they named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say Alyona, who is now ten, has no memory of the attack and has grown up to be a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "they are a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep his children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.

4 Tips to Take Better Photos and Videos Underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or filming underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which cost around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules for best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set up your camera based on the type of photos or videos you'll be taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scene or recording mode that optimizes exposure for dark underwater environments.
And before you do, find out how deep you can dive with your gear.
Some cameras are designed for up to 5 feet, others for 50 to 60.
Read our buying guide and rating digital cameras in both regular and waterproof designs.
Always take a few shots - a lot of them won't work out.
Compact cameras have an LCD to help you compose photos, but outdoor cameras don't.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater it will be difficult to see and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take multiple shots.
If your camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of shots with a slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of that.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you dive, the fewer colors you'll see.
Get close to your subject.
This is great advice if you're shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dim light.
This is especially important if you're shooting with an outdoor camera: These devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the camera frame, you need to get closer to the subjects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in such a huge organisation as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he has dedicated his career to relieving patients of the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the effects of torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnoses and diseases, the treated patients were overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel comfortable in my own skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
Struggling with flu symptoms, he found himself impatient and remorseful of his wife, Juliet.
He noted, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague did an X-ray of his chest.
One week or two before, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoke.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material that was once referred to as "miraculous" but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma was not hard to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 60s, when a ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation layers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
A toxin used in industry in another era hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But such complacency is misplaced.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is now peaking in Britain.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease per year is twice as many as the number of car accident victims.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The scourge of mesothelioma is not just for veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we shop.
Thus, mesothelioma does not respect social class, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged strongholds, from London department stores to public schools, do not provide shelter.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor did he lay insulation.
He tried to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years practicing," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was able to partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who practiced at Guy's Hospital who developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us get the same disease?"
According to leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory glance at the files from the archives of the courts, to which the afflicted often turn and demand compensation, shows how widespread the mesothelioma scourge has become.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, overseeing the clothing section in two stores – one of the locations being the company's flagship store, the Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children in their twenties.
"Before it happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed that it could affect me in any way.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
It got its name because of its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Most often today in buildings it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a "major health risk" that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say "there is compelling but circumstantial evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK]."
A Marsk & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pete's work shows that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient studies claim that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known asbestos exposure at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Much of this exposure is due to the "normal use and weathering" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the middle of government may not be aware that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that service elevators and pipes behind parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be damaged by something as harmless as a "strong airflow."
Ministers are often accused of looking only after their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's Directorate of Services insisted that the Palace of Westminster receive a 'positive medical certificate', it is now envisaged that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to inspect Parliament thoroughly, modernise electricity and remove asbestos, and that, after the 2015 elections, MPs will be seated in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Everyone can now just wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009 when he was overwhelmed by something like chills.
He was 45, evening and in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly, I shivered.
It came all at once.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I would drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused, doctors X-rayed his chest and inserted a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they had sent for analysis.
Yet they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and became short of breath.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott made no connection to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had come into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted a panel of experts on his CT scans and X-rays.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel sick, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the space between the lining of his chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I am an optimist.
I tend not to take anything too much," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to develop the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were located in basements, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (like Graham Abbott often) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, for several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients' lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's burner on asbestos mats
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people were exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere, in countless chemistry classes, students built a Bunsen burner on an asbestos mat.
Websites have been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Innocuous things like floor tiles or the roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could recall was in the 70s when she demolished a garden house.
So be careful how you demolish the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but found that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to walk away and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was moving from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have left?'
I was told twelve months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive — breathing itself — is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"Inhaled asbestos needles-shaped fibres are a problem," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, ironically, is the leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knows Lawson and has treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during their hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and "breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is.
By its nature, it is invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, common treatment options used for other types of cancer do not work as well.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You don't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer "doesn't respond very well to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but doesn't cure.
"Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After being diagnosed with mesothelioma, Abbott made contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for people with similar disabilities.
When they called, he introduced himself cheerfully: "Hello, you have called the cancer headquarters."
"He was very positive," Abbott said.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months and probably extend his life by just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After seeing several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they checked me out," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a request form and they would have to approve reimbursement.
In order to get the best treatment available, the issue of money is crucial for mesothelioma patients.
But when treatments inevitably fail, many patients face additional financial worries — about the future of the family they will leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 60s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it can pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually equalized, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminating basement was removed in the 90s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Blaming exposure to deadly asbestos on one company or place of work — usually decades after it happened — has proven to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
The register of insurance policies was lost.
And those who are now defending themselves against the accusations have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response, important new legislation was passed this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to seek compensation even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, paid by insurance companies, for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In this case, those affected will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as compensation - approximately £120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks £350m is "a good job".
"It's a deal written by insurance companies for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't intervened and people with mesothelioma had been able to track down former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had loopholes."
But both Penning and Morgan concede that with seven deaths each year, swift action was needed.
"People are suffering too much and they need help now," Penning said last December during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott was strengthened.
"That's obviously not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it all the time with patients.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can worsen very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-ups showed no signs of illness.
I went for another check in March [2014].
I had several spots [of cancer] scattered in my chest.
My fiftieth birthday was approaching.
It is not life-threatening.
It takes him.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Currently, there are no traces of a tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing my wife how the alarm clock on the boiler works.
When you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As fathers Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or even a hint of a chance of survival.
Illness brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening."

During the 2nd World War, ships are intensively built, and work in shipyards represents the highest risk of asbestos exposure.
Prohibition of imports of blue asbestos
An appeals court upholds Britain's first successful asbestos injury claim.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The UK's Institute of Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
The use of all types of asbestos is banned in Britain.
The Mesothelioma Act enters into force in the United Kingdom.
A $350 million compensation program is launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material in many parts of the world.
World production remains at two million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong power to choose leadership as protesters vows revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite mounting debates over democratic reform.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress effectively authorizes communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it infuriated us," said Democratic Leader Emily Lau of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong were lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos."
Since Britain returned Hong Kong control to China in 1997, Beijing has promised that people will be able to elect executive power by 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but it also sends a clear message that Chinese leaders have a firm grip on the committee's nomination process, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision comes after the summer months saw some of the largest and most closely watched protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is the Occupation of Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupation supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong's government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would launch waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "considered the occupation of Central only as a last step if all possibilities for dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for days for Beijing's announcement, and on Sunday they stepped up security at the government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Stoking unrest is a sign that many Hong Kong residents are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being eroded by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupation Central movement, saying their demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's lifeboat.
"The protest they are talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people attend and for how long," said Regina Ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could hurt investments.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days portraying democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists held an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's electorate.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
Electioneering?
The League in Jihlava is named after a political movement
Approximately 1,600 amateur athletes play small football in the regional capital of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is newly called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement going into the October municipal elections.
The tenth on his list is also the head of small football in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mráka said.
The situation around the first league of small football has already been dealt with by lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and they have recommended a change in the system of distributing subsidies.
According to the city's website, small football gained around a million crowns last year.
Even this year, the amount is in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of small-scale football is not contrary to the law or the directives of the City Hall.
However, the situation is an incentive for the office to modify the rules for allocating grants and subsidies," City Hall spokesman Radek Tulis said.
Drawing subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing support in elections for one political party as a small football party is probably no longer possible.
The Vysočina "big" football has not yet received a similar request from politicians.
That there would be a ČSSD regional championship, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and similar competitions?
I would not be in favour.
On the contrary, I would be glad if sponsors from the ranks of companies would turn to us," said Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football of other parties and movements will not let the name of the league
According to small football players, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own complex with six pitches, changing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách course is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be Český mlýn.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a nonsensical area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka pointed out.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football uses a pitch with artificial grass in the streets of Rošického and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are preparing the modernization or construction of sports facilities at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think that huge progress has been made for small-scale football in recent years," Vymazal added.
Other political parties will not appear in the names of the leagues, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins our partnership, we don't put the other one there," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall commission for sport.
"But let the voters evaluate whether Mráka uses the association Malá kopaná Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition permeates university life - freshmen can fly in a jet plane
We are delighted to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
To leave the best possible experience when arriving at university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said the service has a security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the country in a dangerously loaded car.
With our VIF (very important fresher) options this year, we look forward to ensuring students arrive at university with a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the services have only just launched, they have no reservations yet, but added: "Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students of ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today's students are different when it comes to expectations and wishes – it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and a VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve this.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the Union for Higher Education, noted: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering university this month have to deal with a financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at a dorm, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic necessities.
Feminists take a stand against racism and police behaviour after the events in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed youth.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noticed a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists favor gender over race.
With tensions rising in the Midwest that attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that white women's reaction was 100 percent race-centered.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as "White woman's reflections on Ferguson" and "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
But according to Perez, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level," she said.
People felt they had to comment on what had happened.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially charged that they had to point it out.
According to Koritha Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light issues that African-American women face every day that are not seen as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about non-whites being trapped in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about safety in public spaces?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with issues of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
Black women, she said, didn't have the luxury of dividing up these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women now merge the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor in women's question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and almost all of them were caused by the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery, the split between white and black women came when women suffrage campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain in the late 19th century and realized that only one group of people — women or blacks — could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet their cards on women's voting rights and the right for blacks to focus later," Hattery explained.
Realizing this gives us an important insight into why women of color don't trust white women.
We did not do a good job.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade before they began to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the surge in white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson — police behavior, racial discrimination — reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with issues that black women had grappled with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists in these spaces [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?"
A second wave of feminists who have made a career fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now discovering what that means.
Two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, prominent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem stormed Facebook, posting a column by the Guardian's Rebecca Carroll calling for white Americans to protest racism more forcefully.
"I hope that women who have different yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society — and views about race that differ widely in opinion polls — will push for change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates an intersectional feminism that encompasses issues of both race and gender, her comments on race in America confuse some.
Christina Sommers, an expert at the American Enterprise Institute, author of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments about Ferguson have faced criticism she has previously sparked.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young black men and Hispanics, it sparked angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only issue that has come to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. Border Patrol detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country's southwest this year, the issue of immigration law reform — this time as a women's issue — has arisen again.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to raise the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
Residence of a pig in Ipswich for sale
A realtor removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was posted, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
The one-bedroom detached house, for sale for £120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The informational photos included a picture of a living room in which a pig rests with its head on the sofa.
Realtor Connells said the pig in the photo is the owners' pet.
"The photo was there by mistake and has therefore been removed," a spokesman for the office said.
In a property disclosure, real estate agency Connells described the former prayer room as "a unique separate one-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the town of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest
A lottery player in Harvey earns a million.
The search for a new millionaire in southeastern Perth is underway, with one lucky winner taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw.
For the second time in five years, newsagents in Harvey were lucky in their distribution, most recently in November 2009 to win one million dollars.
However, the lucky winner has yet to apply.
Store owner Steve Forward said the entire southwest Perth town was talking about the win.
It's the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought a win like that was touching.
The eight winners split one win in Western Australia last month, completing several lucky weeks.
Last weekend, the player became one of five August millionaires at Canning Vale, and just a few weeks earlier, the pair won a whopping $7.5 million in Belmont.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th sole lottery winner in Western Australia this year, having won a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains do not depart in the evening.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike for which it deliberately chose a time during off-peak hours.
By choosing a strike time, the GDL takes into account the many people who return from the weekend by rail only on the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of people commuting to work during the day," the union said in a press release on Monday morning.
"Our first strike should hit freight transport first and less passengers," the GDL added.
DB has not yet published an official response to the strike announcement.
It is also unclear how the protest action will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in train drivers' wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours a week.
At present, the average salary of train drivers is between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
DB train drivers work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to accept salary increases with reduced working hours.
They emphasise that the remuneration of train drivers must develop in the same way as that of other railway staff, for whom DB does not provide for a reduction in the working week.
Krest's car threatened to catch fire.
That's why he finished at the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't even think that something like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be provisionally repaired and continue at a slower pace to the service where the mechanics would replace it?
If we had headed straight there, yes.
But we still had two more stages ahead of us and it wasn't possible.
There is a high temperature and the risk of the car catching fire was great.
I can't afford that.
You have completed five special stages at full speed.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go over the vint.
Everything was caused by the fact that we had been working the car for more than half a year to make it at some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You started it in such a way that you could realistically think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car in such a way that we really had to win.
The work was not in vain.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come.
But this is Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one from the top to retire prematurely from the fight for primacy.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also fell out of it.
Were you surprised that so many favorites withdrew?
Yes.
Especially for the spectators it was a pity, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, for whom you are preparing a car, was also at the top for a long time.
But he paid the price for flying off the track and gaining almost two minutes of manko.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could have repeated the podium.
After all, he was setting the first second lap.
But even Mira confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly one year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum Rally.
Can a good driving feeling make you a regular rally competitor again?
Certainly not at this point.
Last year I said that the Barum Rally was my last race and I still didn't keep it.
I decided to do it again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there is another chance in a year, I will probably go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Are you pleased?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, were constantly asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team moves on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't damage the car too much here.
In addition, Honza Sýkora wants to borrow a Fabia from us for this race.
Mira and I will compete in the European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
To do that, we will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you already hint at something?
No, nothing is decided.
When Rally Corsica was part of the World Rally Championship, you reached your best in the series with fifth place.
Are you not tempted to try the tracks there again?
It does not attract.
A verbal agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not had a certificate of incapacity for work issued by your doctor, which serves as proof for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify your employer of your absence.
Subsequently, an agreement was reached that the days would be registered as holidays, but the agreement was made only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent to taking leave confirmed in writing, this procedure has proven successful in practice.
If there is only a verbal agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, may be denied and absence from work considered as a long-term unexcused absence, thus a reason for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a court dispute on an agreement with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been terminated according to § 53, you only have the given days listed in the credit sheet as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absence from the credit sheet does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. inability to receive unemployment benefits), yet it makes it more difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have it confirmed in writing that an accident has indeed occurred as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "sick note", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as early notification to the employer or requesting written consent to take leave.
This will avoid possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
For Tony Stewart, his return to the track ended just a short distance past the halfway point of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the barrier for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172, and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car to the garage, did not comment to reporters and left.
His team principal Chad Johnston said the No. 14 team was disappointed but would now focus on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope to do better there.
Stewart crashed into the barrier for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"We had hopes for a good finish for today's race," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York City, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up in the table.
He returned to racing during the investigation into a tragic accident that killed twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. after driving into Stewart's path during the race.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm cheers before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked his way up to 10th and then even 4th.
Then, at the beginning of lap 122, Busch's No.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart's, sending both cars into the crossbar.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st.
Prague Selects New Taxi Rank Managers, Earns 12.3 Million
Prague has completed tenders for new managers of taxi stands.
For 103 parking spaces, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million annually.
Until recently, it collected CZK 150,000 a year for the same jobs for taxi drivers.
Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) informed about it.
Previously, the city used a draw to select administrators.
The winner then received a rent for a lump sum of CZK 1,000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
At present, the amount of the offer is decisive.
"One year after the termination of the original lease agreements and the launch of tenders, it has been proven that the new rental system is much more advantageous for Prague and fairer overall," the councillor said.
The most expensive spot is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in the site in Na Perštýně Street.
It pays CZK 2.1 million a year.
The new administrators paid approximately CZK 1.5 million for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi ranks were adopted by the councillors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they terminated the original lease agreements.
Tenders were held in four waves and 29 sites found a new administrator.
For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
We drained it every time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo there.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the cellar always provided plenty of wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally done, Grandpa hollowed it out by himself.
A long time ago.
It was only for three rings and overall peculiar, like everything at the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
Having stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water somehow did not smell.
We wondered if something had fallen there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, the plate did not quite fit there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we drained it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised gasket around the pump pipe.
But we noticed strange things in the cellar.
On the ground lay a sticky package with some cubes.
Or so it seemed.
And a little further on, another.
Now it looked like a drooling mouse.
Near the ceiling, in the places where the vents are, grandpa's invention, were the remains of a fish!
And hard to eat!
Our cellar is also peculiar.
Some would say that Grandpa simply dug up the cottage.
And he would not be so far from the truth.
The walls and floor are just trampled sand, only the ceiling is boarded.
They put there mainly boats.
And bicycles.
And sun beds to the beach.
The gates with wide gaps were mostly open as someone walked in all the time.
Near the ceiling several already mentioned vents.
Without a net, so birds normally fly there and build nests on the beams.
It is useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be lufty, and it did.
Now, however, even luft did not help.
The whole cellar smelled.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw out the things that were around: planks, heraclite board, and so on.
Our cottage remotely welcomed passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We wondered who could have pulled those disgusting leftovers there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometres away in the village.
She would hardly come to us for a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who is not quite well.
Didn't Franta put the disgusting stuff through the vent?
He's here practically all year round, stupid ideas, he has that.
We decided to watch the cellar and well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing until the tests were finished, but it was good.
Pulling water from a forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
Once we heard the terrible anxious barking of our.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza jumped over her and squeaked like crazy.
Mom scolded her because she thought Reza had dug the waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially rolled into a ball and partially straightened.
A hiss reached the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical fit.
We ran downstairs.
The grass snake, well over a meter long and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Reza prevented it from doing so.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the grass snake saw the superiority in the form of our whole family, it probably said to itself to eat it if we were so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the vent into the cellar.
We flew after her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind the well.
By the way, we noticed another smelly package on her record.
According to the smell of probably a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a gimmo.
And we locked the cellar even during the day.
That would...
We went out and there we each lay down by one of the vents.
We did not wait long.
Behind the well it rattled.
First appeared a flat head with yellow marigolds on the neck.
Then the whole grass snake swung up onto the well.
It wrapped itself around the pump and began to work its way in.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
After being dismissed, the disgraced employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money before being detained by the police.
Within a short time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"After taking over the notebooks, he took them to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars," said Chief Commissioner of the Šumperk Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for the fraud was revenge on the employer for dismissal and also to gain money.
"During the interrogation, he told us that he used the money to repay loans," Brückner said.
Police also found that the impostor was a pathological gambler who had been repeatedly treated in a psychiatric ward.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we did not find any money from him," the commissioner said.
A fraudster who has already been convicted of theft once now faces between one and five years in prison.
Police have not yet said whether bazaars that bought the laptops below cost and resold them are also facing punishment.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is suspicious to say the least," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar has yet been charged.
Come, just a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of route, which brought the finish to the embankment instead of leading back to Žluté lázně.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took pictures and videos together.
In order to perfect my view from the other side, I took on the role of a personal conductor.
Together with my friend Káťa, we obediently lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who walked past us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few jumps to warm up, turn on the sport testers, countdown and start!
Shouts of cheering, but instead of a quick start, there was a scurrying to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, I turn on the measurement and we start at a pace of ten hours.
We weave through a yellow snake of runners who, like Káťa, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly descending sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad an almost kitschy touch.
The pulsating mass stretching along the embankment looks as if the whole of Prague is running here.
On the embankment between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally becoming clear who has how many powers.
The easy hill on Palackého Square forces many runners to slow down or start walking.
Just before the run to Divadelní I see a police escort and right behind him Vítek Pavlišta is flying at an incredible pace to the finish.
I can hear the admiring sighs of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, cheering him on, he is about to slap me, but just before that, my leg sprains and our hands just miss each other.
Running down Divadelní Street gives you a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It is necessary, there are places in front of us where the views take my breath away.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing and my legs are carrying me almost alone.
After the first refreshment comes the moment of truth.
When crossing the road, Káťa stumbles on the curb and performs a jump float.
I check to see if she needs help and start a series of words of encouragement so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It rises and continues along Goat Lane, it is one of the narrowest points of the track, at this stage of the race there is not such a rush, but it is still necessary to watch the surroundings well.
I still have no idea that the term narrowest place will acquire its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Tower, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to clap hands with everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Katya to do the same, because ten claps with fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are accelerating again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the pursuit has begun.
We overtake dozens of runners, when I pass someone particularly tired, I try to encourage them with a few words: "Come on, just a little more, you can do it!"
After the last refreshment, no one is overtaking us, we are speeding up.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we are adding, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish will hurt, but you need to really work.
The sun has slowly set and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last run to the bridge, turn and just a straight to the finish.
The pace at which we run makes me wonder, where does that come from in this girl?
"Come, we're going under hour thirteen, we're working!"
We try, we sprint and there is a goal.
Hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of twenty hours.
So seven minutes below schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the finish line, Katya's legs buckle, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
You can see exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target area.
Euphoria does not make us think about the crowd in the passages to the changing rooms.
Here you can see that Goat Lane was not the narrowest place.
This is the riverbank behind the finish line, which is under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners crammed to bursting.
If someone doesn't like crowds, this is not the place for them.
Even I lose my head after a while and wonder if the beautiful views and more interesting route compared to previous years were worth what is happening at the finish.
From my own experience, I know that organizing a race is no fun.
If you add ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague to all traffic, it becomes a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in Žluté lázně was transferred among the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators stepped it up on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, when running through the historic city center, you have to count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered by a wall on one side and a river on the other, to be the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with running through the finish line, I rate it as very successful.
Behind the goal, I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion, if you liked the route and what you think about the situation at the destination.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria took part in a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital, Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on the list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, the guards symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still ongoing," Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Employees' Unions at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests by prison service employees.
Why the universe can have multiple dimensions and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University did a hit in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to get into the thicket of problems that many theoretical physicists are engaged in today - the attempt to unify two well-functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of The Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (after all, at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solve it so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to laymen.
Moreover, Greene handled the complex material so freshly and engagingly that he cannot be blamed for not including anything interesting in his book.
Moreover, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
Probably even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, The Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little livelier in this area (for example, due to the fact that the LHC accelerator will finally run at "full throttle"), so it is a good time to enter the door of the world of modern physics that is open by Green.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Nevertheless, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let's turn our gaze away from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more mundane, namely a long and thin garden watering hose.
Imagine stretching a hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a distance of half a kilometer (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily spot a long, horizontally stretched hose, but unless you have an acumen of vision, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at any given moment, you answer with only one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from half a kilometer away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping around a hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "clockwise / counterclockwise dimension", i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the location of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle wrapping the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional.
Non-perturbative aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, indicated by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimension wrapping around the hose circumference is short, "coiled" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, sprawling, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, coiled and much harder to observe.
Of course, in this case, we didn't exactly work hard to reveal the "coiled" dimension wrapping around the thickness of the hose.
It was enough to take binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only discover the coiled dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent Einstein a paper in 1919 in which he came up with the astounding idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by arguing that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework within which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this observation of Kaluza fits in with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines, and which was clearly articulated and specified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands or falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has three, large, and easily visible three dimensions whose existence we are aware of every moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of a garden hose, the universe can also have additional dimensions, tightly coiled into a space so tiny that they have hitherto remained hidden from even our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluza's remarkable design, let's dwell on the hose for a moment.
Imagine that on the perimeter of the hose we draw a fairly dense row of circles in black paint.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With binoculars, thanks to the drawing, we can now reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, because we can see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost limitless, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, making a total of four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, consider the illustration in Fig. 3; It shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we magnify the view of the geometry of the space in a similar way as we enlarged the surface area of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth magnification level) if they are coiled into a small enough space; This explains why we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid represents the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle represents the new, tiny, and coiled dimension.
Just like loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them for clarity only in the intersections in a square grid.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following figures, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; We enlarge it so that it becomes visible.
Nothing special happens at first, as we see in the first few levels of magnification.
But when we go further on our journey to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, circle-shaped dimension, like the loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, just as a hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn the circular dimension only in some, regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza's and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has a large dimension of only one.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just an object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature, it is - like the circular circumference of the hose - much harder to recognize than to observe the obvious, large and extensive dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our state-of-the-art magnification tools.
Most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a rounded bump within ordinary dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of the three common sprawling dimensions.
It is a dimension independent of the other three dimensions, just as the top-down, left-right, and front-to-back dimensions are independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the three usual positions in the circular dimension; If we count the time, then five data, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149, - CZK.
To our surprise, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluza's and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize structures as large as a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Smaller coiled dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about one Planck length, a size far beyond the resolution of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluza-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-act harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Anyone who is confused with music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola aka Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
A puppeteer and puppeteer by education, whose Facebook profile can be followed here, he has been making a living as a graphic designer since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, from which it is reportedly impossible to leave.
He is a guitarist after his father, as is his brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start your training on one string.
"The rhythm model is up to you, you can invent anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen to and watch Honza, what can be invented with twelve harmony on two strings and how nice it is already starting to sound.
If you add a third string, you can flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add a fourth, watch out for the change of tuning, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to pentatonic and try to put it together with twelve.
So practice it honestly.
You can read the best way in the interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his electric guitar school here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, acknowledges Dvořák from Hradec Králové
We take the point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances for us, the second for the home, "said the striker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
Were you not nervous when playing it, after all, it was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, although for the second goal, where the home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You equalized the penalty after half an hour, but you also got a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept through the beginning, we were passive, it was a corner and then a penalty.
After that you picked yourself up and in the first half you were the better team with more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well until the break after conceding a goal.
We said in the dressing room that we wanted to keep the pace of the game after that, but we couldn't do it.
To be honest, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home team said something about their game at the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
On the opponent's pitch you have only scored for the first time, while at home you may not have even conceded a goal.
Why is there such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen is a different category.
You waited four games for a goal, were you not afraid that it could be similar after the last game?
Not really, but of course we are glad that since the last game we do not have to listen to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but they're still only three in six games, which isn't a big celebration yet.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater kilometers away.
Lava rising to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a crater miles away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
For the time being, the situation remains unchanged.
From yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flows out of the fissure about the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists are concerned that the lava tunnel could open up where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
Around the eruption, a strong smell of sulfur is felt, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are a lot more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the area in the morning.
Traces of the sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange level (second highest) for Bárðarbunga and yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the courageous Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Airshow in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 was presented by aerobatic Peggy Walentin, who climbed from the cockpit to the trapeze on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There she is reliant only on muscle strength.
The air show in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting aerial pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walking on the wings" performed by the German acrobat Peggy Walentinová, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his shiny cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the USA.
After the 1st World War, many former war pilots tried to assert themselves.
But due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of air shows.
After takeoff, Peggy climbs out of the cockpit onto the upper wing.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the airplane, where her show continues," said Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and organizer of the air day.
The Boeing Stearman 75 E is piloted by her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was the proverbial icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the field with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called on numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone breathtaking aerobatics with an airplane from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never took part in it.
He was enlisted in the Army Reserves.
From 1963 he worked in the civilian sector.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichovo Hradiště.
In the same place there is also another pearl of the Cheb air day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the massive machine could not be overlooked.
Its polished aluminum coating shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French Air Force also gained admiration.
A small airliner stepped in for the cancelled Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof for the air show.
German neighbors presented themselves in Cheb with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-member formation of biplanes Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: A dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhyová exchanged her parental worries, at least for tonight, for those at work.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter obviously knows none of this.
Presenting TV news went well, as if she hadn't stopped for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended the puerperium, during which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main TV Nova news program yet.
According to information Blesk.cz, she will return regularly in a month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her more than TV viewers now.
Lucie Borhyová returned to the TV screen and it was a hit to the black.
Exhibition in a year in Prague?
The hall would be sold out, Jagr is planning a farewell party
It would be dignified if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union will stand up to it," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the breathtaking Nagano team met again.
Even players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
Players would like it, right?
Definitely.
It would simply be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, you can find one or two days during the tournament when it is completely free and where you could mix such a match.
We'll tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Béďa Ščerban (organizer of the Jihlava match), who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
So when I fly...
But you don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are decisive in the national team.
It's one thing that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
Players who have what it takes should go there, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed in any way.
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion?
Just meeting the players was great.
You relived stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important was the tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first representative match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three youngsters: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, played in one threesome.
It was the first international start for everyone.
Well, that we would somehow dominate, so it can not be said.
Dominik Hašek was fishing in Jihlava after a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team). He just caught it very well.
Even Hnilička performed great.
At the same time, he went to train with me one night and he was leaky.
And now he was catching famously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the footballers start the qualification
Prominent guests came to the NH Hotel in Smíchov on Monday morning.
People could see goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the figure in the black baseball cap, that's Tomáš Rosický!
The Arsenal midfielder and captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around half past eleven among the last.
We have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be excited?" he said as he stepped in front of journalists in his representative kit.
Czech national team program
Monday 1st September: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training open to fans (18:30, Letná) Autograph signing (20:00)
Wednesday 3rd September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9th September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of meeting
Fans can support Rosicky and Co. before Wednesday's match against the USA (20:15).
The national team opened Tuesday's training for them, which starts at Letná at 18:30.
And it will be followed by an autograph session, which Rosický and Čech will not miss.
Otherwise, however, this meeting of the national team will be quieter.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so much time until now, "said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The national team has three matches under Vrba, all preparatory.
They drew 2–2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1–2 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
Until now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they managed a dress rehearsal against the USA.
The first six months were for us to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful, "agreed Vrba.
The only player of the twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is striker David Lafata.
He suffers from temperature.
If he did not manage to recover for Wednesday's match against the USA, coach Vrba would call one more attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a misdiagnosis, she thought she was going to die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can present with motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, awkward gait and twisted toes.
Those affected may also experience numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA), a condition that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she turned eighteen, she would be confined to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mum-of-two, now 51, says: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
Every day I fell and everything took me longer.
I was never able to roller skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school for the way I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was thirteen and had undergone several surgeries to relax her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and looked at her records, where she learned that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought I'd end up in a wheelchair by the time I turned eighteen, and by the time I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone and planning my funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Sweetheart, I don't think you have the disease, otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening."
After passing several genetic tests, it was discovered that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune," she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of awareness of CMT to draw attention to the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: taxes rise with economic turnaround
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxes in the country rose slightly last year as the recovery accelerated, and firms in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers for fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden — both state and local — rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent last year, the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were cut.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, is from business tax, and 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from corporations.
Virginia, at 28%, has the fewest business tax revenues proportionately.
Researchers say most of the tax revenue growth comes from increases in the value of corporate-owned properties, which have increased property taxes 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of -1% growth.
Although most of the profits come from major states like California, New York and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2% annually from $9.6 billion in 2012.
But the apparent increase in property values is driving up state and local tax revenues less in Maryland, where property taxes account for less than one-fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property taxes account for nearly half of state and local taxes.
"In Maryland, a lot of real estate is owned by companies, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or nonprofit organizations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely a lot more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, it seems that business income is also increasing.
Companies in the region posted $2.3 billion in corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected one billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing at the same rate in these three places.
Maryland's growth rate was at the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the tax increase below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of the three districts (all of which have the same taxation), at 6%.
Maryland's corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from competition from the South.
North Carolina recently signed a bill reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, the same as Virginia, and will cut the tax to 5% next year.
If the state continues to meet revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
The business tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax — the structure of offsetting cost increases by price increases that most firms are organized around — in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say the trend and nationwide increases in business tax are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for both state and local governments rising to 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
But Washington may lag behind as cuts in government spending take their toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin's Novorossiya and Lafat's scissors will be the head of Europe
Will a new state emerge in Ukraine?
Putin called for talks on Novorossiya
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that they will find it difficult to return to the Russian market after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions.
The West's support for the Ukrainian army's warfare in eastern Ukraine contradicts democratic values, he said.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic won the right to disagree with part of it
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose within a week the form of further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions, an EU summit decided overnight.
Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chair of the member states' meetings, told journalists.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals to shift the form of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the EU's new "president".
He will replace Van Rompuy in December
At a European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council, the so-called EU president who chairs member states' summits.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
Catherine Ashton will be replaced at the head of European diplomacy by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian woman, who will become Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, we just don't talk about it
To help an incurable and long-suffering patient with leaving life?
In the Czech Republic, where the law does not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, the statements of doctors contacted by LN show that they hear about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter in neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
Approximately three hundred people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the Czech Republic, 21 patients are undergoing experimental stem cell treatment in Prague's Motol district.
We do not know for sure whether it will be successful.
But if we don't try it, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
It shows the handwriting of the CIA, they needed war, writes Huml about the downing of flight MH17
CSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian airliner over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the harsh sanctions that were announced with regard to the downing of a civilian airliner with almost 300 deaths were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the lawmaker, it also shows the handwriting of the CIA.
Undeliverable promises.
Elections are approaching and parties are once again offering the impossible
The end of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car above Prague.
Before every election, this is repeated: parties promise the impossible.
Even now, with the local elections approaching, politicians are competing to see who will appeal to voters more.
The server Lidovky.cz selected undeliverable promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A fierce siege began
It was on August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška constantly asked for the addition of technical equipment and sending it to the front.
The British side finally complied, and included this land unit as one of its forces during the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the hands of German troops.
SUMMARY: Plzeň leads the league before Prague "S", Liberec beat Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which it leads by one point ahead of both Prague "S".
Changes at the top of the table were caused by the defeat of Slavia 1: 2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats in the domestic league recovered Sparta, thanks to two Lafat's interventions beat Jablonec.
The record win in the year was scored by Liberec, which beat Baník Ostrava 6:0.
62,000 spectators at volleyball?

How to survive returning from vacation?
Do not rush anywhere and treat yourself to sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead.
Getting used to the normal pace of work after returning from a sunny beach or cottage can be a challenge for many.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: do not rush and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: 'Keeping our fingers crossed'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that the eighty-one-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We keep our fingers crossed for her.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an ambulance call said she had gone into cardiac arrest at a Yorkwill endoscopy on the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious."
The reactions were not long in coming, including incredible support on the Internet from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted by headlines
That the media distort reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that newspapers "sell" headlines, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who do not read anything else.
And this is a fact that has been bothering me a lot lately, the word "angries" is more apt.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel attacks Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text do you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of a declared ceasefire.
It then appears with the headline "Both sides broke ceasefire".
Does the journalistic community realize that by doing so, they are directly contributing to the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even sixty years have passed since the end of the 2nd World War.
There are still survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogans of "Jewish swine" and similar incredulities, I was stunned.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews, the Slavs were destined for extermination?
Ladies and gentlemen, journalists, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy".
So defend it.
As long as it's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided to liquidate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship reside in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they feel good there.
If you ask them why they don't go among "theirs," perhaps to Gaza, they will tell you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch health care (I have seen firsthand how Arabs routinely go to the top private Hadashsa Hospital, which is funded by donations from Jews from all over the world, and are understandably treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Report on Hamas's practices, on its use of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area has been able to flourish thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which Gaza administrators do not pay and even get angry that the power supply is sometimes cut off at this time.
If Hamas had invested money not in building underground tunnels for suicide bombers to enter Israel, but in building apartment buildings, hospitals, and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would live much better.
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed Information's claim from Monday morning: An online retailer — a producer of videos and hundreds of other things — is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement sparked a surprise not because no one expected anyone to buy Twitch, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, a one-billion-dollar sale of Twitch to Google seemed certain, and that connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago by Justin.tv, was poised to become a widely used video streaming service — a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream online game streams to it — in Business Insider's words, "YouTube for live gameplay."
Interaface of Twitch.
On YouTube, "Let's play" videos are already popular, the kind where sages (mostly older) give games a Mystery Science Theater adaptation.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch did not excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, they share the same values and long-term vision, and they want to help us deliver faster."
Another mystery is – frankly – Twitch's incredible success.
For snobs like me, who claim to do sports rather than watch them, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about just watching games instead of actually playing them.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder at three in the morning as Resident Evil plays, and quite another to watch a stranger get twenty hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you might be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from a player's perspective, so watching their replay without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting headaches.
I admit that speed run games in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time are fun.
But unless someone is a master of gaming or humor, their Twitch channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch mixing into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that any business would like to attract: the hordes of young men advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games," and the media doesn't seem reluctant to be reluctant to be viewers, either.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
Original video attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by actual human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often confront us with the question: Who will you believe?
The alleged word of God or the word of man?
As if human inquiry were utterly trivial compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they are referring to the myths about God written down by men.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who supplied further lines of evidence that point exclusively to an evolutionary conclusion down to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems as if he is trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, they can fabricate.
And it was the people who wrote all these texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written down by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by none other than mere mortals with a certain amount of imagination, not angels, and certainly not gods.
If there really was one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic super-genius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only Holy Scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors could not compete with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal a profound morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of a common faith.
If God had written it, we would have expected nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origins, and they all continue to break up into increasingly separate denominations seeking questionable truths, each claiming divine guidance in some way, regardless of continued divergence and separation in every way.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Qur'an, Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Akdas, Zoroaster's Avestas, Sikh Adí-Granth, Mahabharati Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, and the Urantia Book are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true God," and the respective believers of each say that the others are astray.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is misguided to some extent.
None of the above books has any advantage over the others.
None of them has any evidential basis, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologia (defenses) because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So they cannot be said to be evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies - each of which may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Eminent theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to interpretations, impressions, and views by their primitive and often prejudice-bound politically motivated authors, thereby explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but rather a mutual comment.
We must point out again that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and it's certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some scholars now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e., the five Books of "Moses," and attribute authorship to Moses of any of them, because he almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Scholars agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were filtered at the same time, and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docetites and Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these modifications refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Mosaic religion, the New Testament writers decided to ridicule Ba'al Zebul, "Lord on the Mountain," into Beelzebub, "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible has been deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century A.D. in a series of commission decisions at the Council of Nicaea.
Four gospels were adopted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple show of hands, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found themselves approaching the same Gospel stories.
Thus the core of the canon developed from the usage of the early church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even if they were referenced by books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both apostles and prophets.
Why should God's Word refer us to books that are just people's words and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this haphazard jumble of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was definitely written by humans, and certainly not by very enlightened people, quite the opposite!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from beginning to end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in incantations, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fire potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray blood on someone, it would cure them of leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought that rabbits are ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish and pi is an integer.
These people believed that if they showed a pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it does.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all that it contains.
It totally fails as a moral guide because most of the original Hebrew writings were written by ignorant and bigoted savages who condoned or encouraged animal cruelty, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
To justify their inhumanity by claiming to be doing God's will.
But creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact contradicts the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshiping creation instead of the creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and of God Himself, and even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of god, but all versions of god.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books are God Himself, because they think they are HIS Word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that men approved or rejected into their supposedly "unchanging word" of any god was invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, and often deliberately altered and distorted by mere fallible people.

Attacker stabbed nine people at Chinese school, three of whom died
A man named Chen forcibly entered the primary school building in the morning and attacked around half past eleven local time, according to the New China news agency.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, citing the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is calling for greater safety measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the first-graders in Lány how he had to sit at school
The smallest schoolchildren were taken by the ninth graders to their class, where they waited with the teacher for the arrival of the president.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that doesn't happen to you anymore, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first-graders a puzzle as a gift.

Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport more," he explained one of the reasons why he went to northern Bohemia on the first day of school.
Some time ago, the school management approached him at an ice hockey match in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the opening of the school year," the minister added.
Education Minister Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
This year, 115,000 first-graders entered the first classes.
A total of more than 850,000 children will attend primary schools and more than 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of Nova news is David Fiala
David Fiala has become the new art director of news and current affairs at TV Nova on 1 September.
He will replace Alan Záruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova Group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of the Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has participated in the implementation of the complete visual transformation of the news programs Televize noviny, Střepiny, Prásk! and other current affairs programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala has a very good command of the synergy of communication between the editorial office, studio management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the work of an art director of news.
He has a sense of typography and clean, elegant design, which is the path we want to follow in Nova's news visuals," says Nova's creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, naked pictures of celebrities leaked to the public
Screenshot of listing leaked files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on the server 4chan publishes nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com pointed out.
He allegedly obtained them by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as faked, but several of those affected have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Death Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos for enrichment.
American magazines have reportedly expressed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker prefers to get money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a weakness in iCloud's security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub that allowed passwords to user accounts to be obtained through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
The tool has proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was made public.
As a precaution, iCloud users should change their Apple ID password.
What matters is the length of the password, not its complexity.
A length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The leak of nude images of celebrities is seen as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times more secure than computers in homes or small businesses, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also wise to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it takes place only on wi-fi and when connected to a charger.
This will allow you to move sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you will have space to delete unsuccessful images, so they will not take up unnecessary space in online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet are offered to HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
A smart way to save on college textbooks
With the cost of college textbooks for many students exceeding $1,000 per year, an up-to-be second-year student has come up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from his upper-grade classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"I got a calculation book, which normally costs $180, for ten semesters and chicken nuggets," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his final semester would cost $430, he says.
Spent 120.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing those expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder's are becoming students' preferred choices.
Textbook lending is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were loaned last spring semester, says Neebo vice president Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of textbooks are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Shops.
Here are the top 101 ways to succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books on the Internet can be up to a third lower than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but it can be purchased online at Chegg.com textbook retail for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's notes or wear and tear and damage, used textbooks are a good option.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not essential for seminar work.
If so, older editions may sell for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com are also popular alternatives to buying used books.
Lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow a "Calculus" for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of the store where you rent the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting, or wear and tear, and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, this allows students of literary courses to find the best deals, as many classics are now available for free download, while science and engineering texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees you're buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it's in stock, Gault advises.
He found out for himself.
The book he bought sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found the torso of a rifle from the end of the war in the well
The well is a short walk from St. George's Church.
We uncovered the vegetation around and began to pull out the aged deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we were approaching the clay bottom, we hit the barrel," Radomil Novák recounted.
We pulled it out, cleaned it and found that it was the torso of a German assault rifle used by the SS.
The find is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were not produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All wooden construction things have decomposed over time, therefore it is unusable.
Her body, however, is preserved - it keeps its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Perhaps it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably for fear of being expelled.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing weapons in the forest," the finder said.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from the Rainbow Jeseníky Movement found in the well.
"There could also have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully palpated the mud to avoid any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find ends up in the depository of the museum at the castle in nearby Slezské Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet freed a captured Czech
An exclusive interview Aktuálně.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take it... they are calling me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they were - or should be - that Ruban specified with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That will be it - go there," he ended one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, again focusing on ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the reserves, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Just yesterday - when we arranged an interview - he was in Donetsk.
Liberating Ukrainian soldiers from captivity by pro-Russian separatists is devoted twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counter-intelligence estimates their number at thirty.
However, there may be many more.
Have you ever met any Czech prisoners of war in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have already liberated captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, a Swede, a Georgian... but not yet Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we come across your captured compatriot and can free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What advice do you have to the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if Czechs fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will shoot them without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists regard these men as mercenaries for hire, and they deserve nothing but death.
If, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - including a Czech - they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to rescue?
If I understand correctly, it is by exchange.
Some sources say that it has long since exceeded a hundred men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped a long time ago.
But we just freed them... They will not save them from war if they decide to continue fighting.
Rescuers in war are doctors, surgeons, but we certainly are not.
That's the way it is.
And every day more and more are added.
Every day we save someone.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to release prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained a lot of authority and even trust among the pro-Russian separatists... As in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the mad general with steel balls".
I'm not offended.
And maybe that captures the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officer Corps, I had already gained some authority.
I never cheat, I never cheat and I always keep my word.
No matter what, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even if it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or for the Donetsk or Luhansk governments.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they torture and kill them.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, I was even captured during a prisoner exchange... This job can mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know about?
... (long pause)... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture prisoners during interrogations.
Unfortunately.
And executions?
These are taking place only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Not even hints that the Ukrainian army is doing something similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
They include officers, as well as veterans of Afghanistan.
They are striving for independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - or so they say.
They no longer want to play games with the Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their implacable opponents - to the death.
As we say, they ate up to their throats.
By the way, people expressed the same dreams and desires on the Maidan.
And now I'm speculating a little: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other to be small.
But this sentence of mine already conceals an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, how do you see one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and show soldiers or armed men my bare hands outstretched.
And both sides always have me two or three hundred meters in the sight or in the optical sight.
I can always see the faces of people pointing at me... And they can pull the trigger on their weapons at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, it is only as a small governorate in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, he keeps talking about it and considers Ukraine to be a kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters, on a Ukrainian TV talk show you described your prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, as a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best to leave quickly.
In those three hundred meters of walking, I always get scared at least five times.
So why should I hide the opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he was involved in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk "the rabbit."
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of Ukrainians, an animal that would be feared or respected and autorited by others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister in war he has no right to cry in parliament, beg him, play his intrigues with him, threaten to resign from office... He must govern the country, administer it, and protect it in time of war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest for tearful emotions.
After all, he is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She behaves like a pubescent girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he doesn't fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Revenue
Sylvester Stallone's Expendable 3 returned less than $30 million from a ninety million dollar budget in the U.S., and Sin City: The Woman I Would Murder for returned only $12 million out of a $10 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's Sex Tape grossed only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, and children's films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 were also a disappointment for theaters.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, the very quality of children's films is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year for children's movies and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "working" sequel.
When it comes to films aimed at a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem is not necessarily in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings for summer movie premieres airing in at least 2,000 theaters between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both audiences and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, the change in viewers' attitudes and the increased popularity of Internet sites such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's adaptation of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what has already been.
In contrast to the current Hollywood blockbuster crisis, Netflix's Internet services revenue reached $1.2 billion, nearly twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too heavily on comic book rights and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators have argued that there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the release of possible big blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other numbers in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the decline in sales simply "cyclical." He told the Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest blockbusters in history, and no one will worry about sales."
North Korea threatens Seoul again, fires another short-range missile
North Korea has fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul announced.
The alleged missile test came shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparing for an invasion.
Chagang Province lies in the northwest of the KDLR near the border with China.
A spokesman for South Korea's Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a site in northwest North Korea and traveled to a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea appears to have fired a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud missiles.
This is another in a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has conducted in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in central Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough monitored the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
The teenagers had to be flown from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man went hiking to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police around eight o'clock in the evening.
A search party, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched, and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around eleven o'clock in the evening.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell, hitting his head in the process.
Officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, Vašíček had the win on his leg
It was the 23-year-old who could have decided, but he failed in the two best chances.
After the goal called mainly shot from close range three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on the goalkeeper Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give such chances.
I'm angry with myself," Vasicek sprinkled ashes on his head.
"I probably should have put it higher under the lid, it slid off a bit," he mused.
The Sigma defense did not allow Opava much, the exception was Mikula's raid from the 11th minute, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanáci began to push, but the home team did not let them into chances in the block and Květoň caught the shots from a distance.
We compared ourselves for fifteen minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vasicek did not change the chance, so it ended 0: 0, "regretted coach Hanák Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took a point due to absences in the lineup, where in addition to a pair of injured were missing Petr Vavřík with three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík, who are on loan in Silesia from Sigma.
Unlike its previous policy, it did not allow them to board.
The substitutes deserve to be discharged.
Sigma looked more football-like, but except for one standard, we did not let her do anything, "said the coach of Silesians Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combativeness.
The draw is probably deserved, a point is a decent gain for us," he added.
Sigma's draw brought them to four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébr, who after the defeat with Znojmo conditioned his million dollar deposit into the treasury diametrically different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébr's warning, so there can be no question that the boys do not want to fight," Kalvoda noticed and added to the sleeping shooter Vasicek: "I believe it will come and when he scores a goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I will immediately replace him to save the goals for the next matches, "Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino twice impressed Venice.
Otherwise, the film festival is experiencing a crisis
After the huge enthusiasm over the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu suddenly became a serious contender for the Golden Lion, the following days suggested that interest in the 71st Venice Festival had somewhat waned.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films such as the documentary about the genocide in Indonesia of the 60s A Look of Silence and other films with social themes from American 99 Homes to Iranian Short Stories, the cinemas simply remained empty seats.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet been besieged by such crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly ceased to be a problem to find a place in a hotel at the last minute.
The crisis is more talked about in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected such esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who performed dramatic roles quite successfully in 99 homes, for all generations without distinction the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino became the main event.
In addition, he starred in two films.
In Oscar-winning Barry Levison, based on Philip Roth's Epiphany, Pacino has a role close to his heart: an actor at the height of his fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as an eccentric hardware store owner from a rural town in David Gordon Green's film Manglehorn was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not be missed - but does an artist of Pacino's calibre still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian one in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italians
After all, Italian cinema is doing very well in Venice this year.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film after Birdman to be rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen through the lens of family relationships between clans fighting for power and money, and the director has managed to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a good script, camera, music and actors.
Also intriguing was the intimate psychological thriller Hungry Hearts, shot by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost kills her own child with her misguided scrupulousness.
On the other hand, neither Ransom for Glory nor 3 Hearts, both works adhering to the traditional model of consumer films that rely on the popularity of the actors, received a warm reception from the French competition films.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new She's Funny That Way, a witty comedy presented in Venice out of competition and shot in the style of American comedies of the 40s, managed to lift the mood for more than one day.
Police caught four methamphetamine producers in Prague, bringing drugs from Poland
"In recent days, detectives have detained three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a twenty-five-year-old woman who produced and sold the drug methamphetamine in Prague 9 from last November until this August," police spokeswoman Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihlářská Street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who figured in the group as a buyer of medicines in Poland and a seller of doses.
The following day, detectives arrested another member of the group, a thirty-seven-year-old man, based on the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four police officers caught on Wednesday morning, August 20, in the area of the Malešice incinerator," the spokeswoman described.
For transporting medicines from Poland, the woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of activity.
In the workshop of the Letná complex, in a garden house in Horoměřice, in an apartment in Koněvova Street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced methamphetamine, procured various aids and chemicals needed for its production, and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the produced drug, divided it into plastic bags and then sold the methamphetamine.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or sale to drug addicts, he was helped by a twenty-five-year-old woman, who had not yet been punished.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rösslerová added.
Criminalists also carried out several house searches based on the judge's order, seizing drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, plastic bags, syringes, tubes and other aids and items that, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police found out that the main organizer had been sentenced seven times for property crime since 1995, the woman had not been punished in court," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was given a suspended sentence for sexual abuse in 2006, and the thirty-seven-year-old car mechanic, who is being prosecuted at large, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with committing the crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three people, the investigator eventually filed a motion with the public prosecutor for custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth accused, a thirty-seven-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other defendants.
Police continue to work with the man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things at very "interesting" prices within its other products.
A good example in Italy is handmade chess with a 42 x 42 cm board.
If you like it, prepare more than 40 000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer receives a set of wooden black and red painted figurines stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fiber.
Perhaps no one will be surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a prancing horse.
If chess doesn't seem like a valuable enough gift, there's also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (by hand, of course) in 1:1.8 scale.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Abolishing grammar schools and secondary schools does not make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that grammar school students have good jobs.
The beginning of the school year is here.
Great preparations have been made in schools over the last fortnight.
Most of them are routine matters, such as moving the pots from the summer storage back to the classroom and getting chalk.
At the Hořice grammar school, they will have a little more activity.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year grammar school in Hořice opens and resumes its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by registration in the register of schools administered by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports.
"French socialists should shut up and put France in order," says a key ally of François Hollande
Valls calls on the deeply fragmented left to "show its support" for a combative socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the approval of a majority of French people.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, drawing applause.
In a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France's controversial thirty-five-hour week, despite heated arguments from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who earlier this week suggested relaxing the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "cohesive" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, drew a spanner in the works when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs where she criticized the Socialist Party for "losing faith in the future" because of it.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed off the constant internal strife among the Socialists, saying she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor François Hollande is naked and so is Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and said she believed the party could win early elections and was ready to run the country.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the extreme conservative right won elections to the European Parliament.
According to an opinion poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before Hollande's term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer be restricted by Prague until the elections
Changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
More gambling establishments will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
Walking dogs will not be restricted either.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the assembly before the October elections.
"Moreover, decisions on changes should not be made by the current city leadership, whose mandate ends in a few weeks," said Councilor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling across the board in recent weeks.
However, casinos will not disappear, the gambling decree will not be changed yet.
It is the task of the new city leadership after the elections.
Now we would not even be able to do it technically, for example, due to deadlines for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the ordinance, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a blanket ban on gambling is being prepared on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, there is a ban on gambling, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not be changed in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Prague 1 in particular is complaining about this, as it has already sent the City Hall a proposal for places it would like to extend the current list of prohibited places.
Prague 5 around Anděl also does not want musicians.
The city has been preparing a decree regulating dog walking for several months, but it has not yet been completed.
The location of gambling halls and busking issues are addressed by city ordinances.
They may be issued or modified only by the City Council.
Town halls have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he put victory within reach of the proponents of Scottish independence
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake a third time when it almost put on billboards all over Scotland the question of whether Scots wanted to be rich.
But you don't reach the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor do you earn their respect when you threaten them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots are far more inclined to drive money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
Alex Salmond, the leader of the Scottish Nationalists, knows this well, and in a televised debate he repeatedly asked his rival, the unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and start supporting a single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into the trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
But the debate about what kind of currency Scotland would have has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, jobs and the defence of the NHS, which citizens have for free.
Darling supported London bankers on the currency issue and gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of the health service.
In putting Salmond, he "climbed into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to voters, but to the association of "bosses", the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish First Minister Salmondo was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee homemaker.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish First Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say that, it causes him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots should not jump up and down and must accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school according to Miloš Urban

Milos Urban The longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week when we didn't go anywhere and we just lounged and fluttered with the Indian summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes, when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, whizzing around the Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun caressed his back and shoulders, tapped the rays of goodbye.
In the evening, a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep until half past eleven, in a week it will be worse, the moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at half past seven in the morning.
Monday will come.
Most of the time it does not rain, on the contrary, summer is maliciously sneering in front of school.
Crawling in the ghostly light to the square and feeling like a plastic figure in a glass paperweight, there is the school, ZDŠ A.
Zápotocký with monstrous pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more drawn, girls more busty.
There are thugs out there, they can be avoided, it's still interesting how they stick together unmistakably and how early they are here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came in squeamish are now laughing hysterically at something, probably something has changed in their lives over the holidays, whereas with me everything is business as usual.
And again new first-graders, some nervous and others excited, why do they come here at all?
Because they have to, educational military service is compulsory.
So inside, the cold dampness of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately still the same one who allegedly lends the pupil the key to the tin cabinet, where you can leave textbooks and which are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the locker rooms remains in the memory, now it does not take place, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
Just the thought makes my stomach clench and my head starts to hurt.
A head that is even worse for the curriculum of mathematics, that devilish game for the chosen ones, among which I do not belong and never will be.
Again, those threes and fours, God forbid, fives, to hide from rehearsals, to fit into the bench and preferably sublimate, to be there and not to be, to exist only as a name in the classroom and dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, about antennas to space, where no one competes with anyone, humiliates no one and does not trip anyone's leg.
The longest year has ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She faces up to an exceptional sentence - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the cabin of the public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without anyone else's help, she gave birth to a girl, whom she wrapped in a prepared blanket after cutting the umbilical cord, hid under her jacket and carried her to the road slip road, where she put her in bushes located a few dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It probably came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus I felt the need to go to the toilet, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I used to wear to school," the defendant described, adding that she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the scene, put the child's body in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit says, adding that it is not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been tens of minutes, but also several hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or placed under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unbandaged umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated the following spring.
The woman secretly gave birth herself at an unspecified time from February to April 12, when the child's corpse was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in the Havlíčkův Brod region.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without checking whether it was born alive, without cutting and tying the cord that was wrapped around the neck, she put the baby in several plastic containers, including a plastic bag, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his then partner drove him to a pond.
Eventually, she was denounced by a friend
The father of both children was the defendant's boyfriend, who allegedly did not know about his partner's pregnancies.
For this reason, he is not now on trial, he was only punished for an offense against the funeral law.
It was also he who later contacted the police.
I do not like that he is not punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was not right, but it seemed to me at that moment as human," said the defendant, who allegedly succumbed to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke relatively composedly.
Tears came to her eyes when she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she herself left after reaching the age of majority.
She didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't buy a kit because I didn't want children, I felt young.
I kept wanting to put him in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," she told the judge.
However, she denied that she acted with premeditation and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, she said, was stillborn.
Even during her pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
However, I have limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also cut down on smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed to everyone and repeated questions that she had health problems, that she was watered.
Even to a friend.
The trial will continue at the Hradec court on Tuesday with the testimony of court experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
The woman faces a sentence of up to 18 years in prison or an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is close to buying Prestige Cruise three billion
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL. O), the world's third-largest cruise ship operator, is in negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The deal was made by Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion that competes with greater competition from Royal Carrebian Cruises Ltd. (RCL. N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), provided access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and wealthy clientele.
The deal could be made public as early as this week, the source said on Sunday, but cautioned that negotiations still may not end successfully.
Owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO. N), also owns a twenty percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because the hearings are not public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises officials did not respond to requests for comment, and an Apollo spokesman declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% from the prior year.
The twenty-nine billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since the $850 million deal closed in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with cruise operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested one billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
According to regulatory filings, as of the end of June, Genting owned a 28% equity stake, Apollo 20% and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to initial public offerings registration documents, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American passenger volume.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities the day after the vote was decided
Nearby, a group of people loyal to Beijing stood waving the Chinese flag.
A Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates should take part in Hong Kong's 2017 elections.
All candidates must first win the support of the appointment committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
The decision makes it nearly impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democracy activists to renew their pledge and cripple Hong Kong's financial center with protests by the "Occupy Central" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China's authority in Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, which will feature Premier Li, is being organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Ronghsun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences during the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations on "state sovereignty" with eastern Ukraine
According to a description of the events by a Russian newspaper, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the breakaway regions.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin's remark was not meant to imply that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed to give the Russian-speaking area the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponds to the apparent strategy it has followed since the riots erupted five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorossiya de facto independence so that it can ally itself with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions aimed at retaking the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency published Putin's words saying that a "prisoner of illusions" is anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians have launched campaigns ahead of parliamentary elections on October 26, while government troops are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of south-east Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin's allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev's leadership for months to allay concerns about Russian-speaking areas about threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter to be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's move to correct a "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the population of two million is ethnic Russian.
Moscow would also have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians and opinion polls conducted before the conflict showed broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, effectively giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main naval fleet, naval trading facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia's Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
During his inauguration speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers — after new elections — consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed another rebel advance last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov entered eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This precipitated a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a metallurgical port of 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - leaders call for the adoption of further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units entered the Donetsk region last week to support besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk in the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also implicated in the scandal with the revealed photos
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence leaked online in the biggest celebrity hacked scandal.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos with nude Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the iCloud leak, personal photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko have reportedly leaked to the public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, told the online newspaper that the hack was "shameless" and those targeted "feel humiliated," according to correspondents.
The hacker is believed to have obtained thirty photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two images of her sprawling topless by the pool.
Palmer starred in Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and Sucker thriller actress Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ: "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on Twitter: "Posting photos of hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma football players made Lébra better, even without a win
Olomouc - Thunder and lightning, which the co-owner of Sigma Olomouc Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seem to be a thing of the past.
Although from Opava eventually brought only a point for a goalless draw.
By their commitment and combativeness, they still calmed down the club boss a bit.
The money for the salaries could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game, as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The fighting spirit and commitment with which we played, especially in the second half, was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive not winning.
If we had played like that from the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet, "says Lébr.
Sigma in Opava withstood the initial pressure of the home team, then equalized the game and in the second half was better.
After the victory, Kalvod's wards reached for it, but they did not reach for a goal, so they could not win.
The result is not to our liking.
To our complete satisfaction, we missed only one converted chance, "said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the approach of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the side of the coach, or the fans, "said Lébr.
Sigma has to reckon with pressure
The players did not want to comment on last week's events after the match in Opava.
I try to give these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it, "shook his head young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
Completely without comment, he left a question about Lébra's statements from last week striker Vašíček who did not convert the biggest opportunity of Sigma in Saturday's match.
Eventually, however, he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
Everyone wants to pull on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride all on our asses, it will work," he said.
They took the warning to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today you could see that they took Mr. Lébr's warning to heart.
Although even before it was not about the fact that they did not want to fight and slacked off, "said the Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took us a while to come to terms with the toughness and realise what League Two is all about.
That it's not just about football, but mainly about the combativeness," Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next matches it will work for Sigma from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
