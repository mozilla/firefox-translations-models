The Republican Party's Strategy Against Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the necessity of fighting voter fraud.
But the Brennan Center dismisses such fraud as a myth, arguing that voter fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die from lightning.
Indeed, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the US over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the US, individual states are responsible for organising federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that make the process of voting or registering on the electoral roll more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the franchise in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws restrict the early voting period, invalidate the right to register on the electoral roll on election day, and deprive citizens with a criminal record of voting rights.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indian law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend the procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million of voting age, do not own any photo ID issued by their state government.
Further, about five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
In addition, the required ID often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people on low incomes.
25% African-Americans, 15% of those with incomes below $35,000; As a result, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their affinity for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their school-issued photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who are more likely to vote for Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs during elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona introduced the first such requirement.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers supported laws in eight states that abolish voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register around 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early election period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of early voters, even though only 13% of African-American voters in that state were African-American.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, accounted for only 46% of early voters.
Of course, the passage of laws that restrict voter registration was strongly opposed by democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their vetoes.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
They managed to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo ID.
However, the new rules will undeniably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics have cited bias in the laws passed as an apparent effort to influence the outcome of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states where these laws have passed account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win a presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is already certain: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detecting prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test yielded erroneous results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitancy of the men, who were already so reluctant to go for the examination at all.
To get tested or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA showed high levels of contamination between the different test groups, making it difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent examinations and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year gap that those who do not go for the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend testing from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also a more vulnerable group.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and those that are inert.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the extent of the danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not have a long-term impact on life, and to focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and life-threatening.
Rather, we will suggest active surveillance and offer them treatment in case of disease progression.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we are establishing criteria that help us decide which species to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend that you undergo the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In partnership with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best means of reducing the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and exercised enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone quit smoking, that figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Society for Cancer Research.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancer diseases are caused by heredity.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
The fight against smoking remains a priority for the Canadian Cancer Research Society, even as the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu, shaking his head.
Encouragingly: 10 years after a smoker quits, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Physicality and obesity are another risk factor for the disease, according to SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colorectal, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages, for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet yielded unequivocal conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although one of them says it will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study talks more about increasing it.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu goes on to insist on the importance of talking about his family concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"Getting tested doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a rightful stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is not yet one hundred percent certainty among physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson as predicted by the Standard Model.
New data released this week during the major physics congress in Kyoto tend to confirm this, but all the data are still lacking to be absolutely certain.
However, suppose it is a Higgs boson, since the risks of error appear to be small, and let's look at what it is.
In this world there is an absolutely unquestionable law according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can not be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state", roughly speaking, creates some of their properties.
Furthermore, physicists divide particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to the Pauli principle.
And at the other end are bosons, vile anarchists who value nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the (by the way, absolutely amazing) device that is The Particle Adventure at Berkeley Laboratories: mesons, which we will leave unnoticed here, and "force particles", which propagate the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "cancels" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" gives rise to an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, the "carriers of power".
More stable field
It is also the case with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that another field, the Higgs field, is necessary to "cancel" it, for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; To excite it, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen surface of a pond, which is only disturbed by a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - the Large Hadron Collider with friendly beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The electromagnetic field analogy is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the fridge by itself.
And it is also true that not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) do not.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what are all this research for, what will it "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, it confirms the validity of the Standard Model (SM), allowing physicists to examine any discrepancy between SM observations and predictions.
Moreover, quite a few physicists literally wish that they could be found, because the slightest difference could open the door to "new physics" and close some of the gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not provide any explanation of gravity (oh!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the cosmic matter (oh again!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such discrepancies.
Repercussions
The repercussions of these surveys in the everyday lives of Mr. and Mrs. Novák are very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
See: in the early '60s, the pioneers of the Bell Labs laser had no idea of the revolution their work would generate.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said it - the laser was initially considered such a "lab toy".
Just imagine...
In addition, all the tools that surround research can also come into play.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around the LHC necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that one really never knows...
Palliative care - The best way to leave life... | Le Devoir
Through its Commission on Dying with Dignity, Quebec recently became involved in the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to continue shortly, and a bill is being drafted at the same time.
Much remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's been seven," he says emotionlessly in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The illness has done its work: extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet alone or even to eat himself.
He looks resignedly at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by his place, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," she says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"All your life you learn that guys urinate standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
To return to the baby stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of each person" whether he accepts the return, the psychologist says.
In the opinion of many palliative care professionals, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "of suffocation while fully conscious."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says, and then she agrees to be put on a breathing apparatus.
Nevertheless, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor-Gadbois Home, body care is provided with the help of nutrition in collaboration with a group of volunteers.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little if we realize that we will all die at some point.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be given, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, to taste.
Diabetics no longer have to watch their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they brought beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care service.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, the days go one after another, but they do not resemble each other.
Next to a ninety-three-year-old man who rejoices in his last meeting with his family, thoroughly cushioned on pillows while they toast in his honor, a tragically thirty-six-year-old man dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying every possibility to survive.
"For six months now, there have always been three to five beds for people with cancer under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the patient reaches the final stage of their lives, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Treatment Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
It is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec that has led many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be agreed to.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is concerned that patients will ask for death because they do not receive appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their treating doctors for not granting their wishes when the palliative pussy team relieved their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is definitely not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either in bursts or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will increasingly have access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not sedated always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But this doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me", it means "I want you to relieve my pain."
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Widespread real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, lobbyists from political parties and experts on the Italian mafia keep telling what they know about the amazing "system" that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
This "industry" cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
He sparked a scandal in 2011 following a thorough investigation into the misappropriation of funds in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which was approved by Jean Charest, then Quebec's liberal prime minister, only after long delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transportation alone has saved a billion dollars in contracts," with some people reining in their instincts to get a stake in them!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to resign," he adds, hoping to "expose the cunning of some people."
Permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in the fight with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau Retinue", who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "pipeline cartel" significantly mitigates the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and charged a number of municipal councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality, on fraud and corruption.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal traffic engineers and businessmen of Italian descent, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have also received formal charges.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when he explained to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of winning public contracts.
During those years, he donated 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal to a mafia-linked middleman, who then transferred the money to the Union Montreal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was running.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000, donating more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines, the prices of which he exaggerated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was very active.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: over a decade, he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and $736,000 in pocket money from construction companies in exchange for money pipeline contracts that he inflated.
Other public officials in the transportation community admitted to being paid bonuses for overstating invoices by 30% to 40% through false extra work.
The mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that was bringing dirty money into his coffers.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a full-scale crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, since 2010 she has campaigned against the sale of municipal land purchased for $ 5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says he is "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the workings of the ant-riddled system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process, she said, is "painful but positive."
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but we need to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot be brought back.
Like when they clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly worried about the role of "deputies informed of this ruse" if they have not dipped themselves into these shenanigans!
He estimates that 70% of campaign funding in Quebec comes from dirty money, adding ironically, "I've heard it's just a faint reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but that won't solve the situation, he said: "Until election spending is strictly curtailed, dirty money won't disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive overhaul of the system of awarding public procurement and party financing: "We cannot go any further; If we focus courageously on the essence of things, we can build again on a firmer foundation and with greater control and compliance with the law."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau advises all those who mock it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You've set a whole new pace with PSG this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into themselves, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
Every day I get further next to them.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier during matches.
Everything goes so fast in football.
But I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in the prep school at INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved up the individual grades.
So you are taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's reinforcements are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training session is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give the maximum performance.
And on top of that, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who used to play in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive word at the right time?
Naturally.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a reassuring conversation with him.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you see the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took the top position away from us.
But we stay in tow.
One of our main targets is the Champions League: we reached the eight-finals very easily.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group before Porto first so that we can play in the rematch of the eight-final at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and make history.
This is not yet the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this happen.
And would it be a big failure not to win in League 1 like last season?
Of course, that would be very disappointing.
We really want to win the league title this year.
Last season we were still missing a lot.
In May we were disappointed because we had what it takes to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think this year it will succeed.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also vying for the title, I think we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and the players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there is still something that the newspapers reproach us with, it's not very pleasant.
One wonders what else people might want more from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to set up our playing style.
You need time to build your team.
In the Champions League we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who failed to reach the quarter-finals for the second season in a row, and they also invested a lot of money!
Given the sums invested, you would expect to be 15 points ahead of the others!
You are insulting other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, who did not do well last season, have moved on to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
PSG seem to rely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances for everything.
It's good that they say there is a "addiction to Zlatan."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and he's proving he's a 1st League star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
We respect the person and the players in our team.
He, too, respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly extraordinary.
This has led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow next to each other.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to the injury, I could not play as I would have liked.
But I experienced it and came out stronger.
Today I manage to play good matches in the national team.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make an exemplary demeanor.
How do you view Didier Deschamps' first months at the helm of the national team?
The results speak for themselves.
We are in a good place in the World Cup qualifiers.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can inspire for victory.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1-1) in Spain on October 16 a solid starting game?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All the negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often the case within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the current financial system, built on banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both virtual money (convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
With 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept Bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it dropped to $ 2, today it is on the border of about ten dollars (an overview of the rates is given on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) takes an interest in this in its report on virtual finance published in October.
He calls Bitcoin "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro," and "the equivalent of ordinary money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is used as "credits" used to progress in a video game that a person earns through play or that one can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, each month the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are current account ledger depositories, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
In fact, each transaction between two users takes place between two electronic addresses using e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction in this ledger.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, whose solver, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is the stage of cutting the file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "chop up" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily check its correctness.
The transaction then appears indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; Any modification would alter the imprint.
If the user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes) for the purpose of fraud, the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned, since each of them has a different fingerprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into up to one hundred millionths, so there is room for margin...
The difficulty of the task also increases with increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin were hacked and stored bitcoins were stolen.
"The loophole is not about the protocol itself," said Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks money laundering opportunities thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a current account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are out of circulation.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payments, but uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make them cheaper.
In addition, the bearer manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up at retailers where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
All you have to do is give an address that can be "photographed and recognised" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and move to more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to break through, but 2013 could be a decisive year," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are currently considered elevated if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The greatest damage was suffered by people in rural Afghanistan, whom we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so did we, because we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They now experience tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the tops of the mountains covered with almond trees thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked, escorted by helicopters.
By the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be as active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable advance between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their takeover of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, who have been completely taken over by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to our time.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban all agree in keeping women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became profiteers, seizing state land to sell as building plots to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and exploiting huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; Moreover, most of them have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people want a government that doesn't consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as do those who have been able to take advantage of America's largesse: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its associated ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and were intrigued by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has a population of 5 million, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given jobs; they do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; TV and Turkish series that show the modern world are watched everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities who lead it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already reassembling provincial militias that will be beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity influence, should enjoy a degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the '50s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is functioning, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; Nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Private initiative takes precedence.
In a country devastated by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be essential.
There were rumors that Afghanistan possessed vast mineral wealth.
And this only fueled the feeling that the Western states were only there to seize it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials across the mountains, however, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site to maintain their role as the province's most important employer.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of its imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, French departments in universities, a French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, there has been a "heart-and-soul" initiative attempting the difficult task of reconciling aid and military activities, which then included the "Civil-Army Action" Service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012 but achieved a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a small French NGO.
These works, involving a number of local workers, helped to put down the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and expansion of the cultivable area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often located above 2 000 m above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural assistance from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from uprisings led by foreign groups, these farmers say they wish to obtain a small amount of civil aid on their behalf that would be properly controlled and affect them directly.
Difficult work on the Egyptian constitution
President Mohamed Morsi embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history over the promulgation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to gamble.
On Wednesday, regardless of the opinion of everyone else, he announced that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this assembly an additional two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been amended many times, which weakens the country's constitutional stability and leads to legal disputes.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's divisions.
From the point of view of the opposition, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "break his word" and "trample on the law."
But his supporters say it is a means of tackling the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks' time.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Society to abandon its intention to clarify the text to the Egyptians article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy while protests are rocking the country.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially since this hastily organised vote presents the Egyptian people with an ultimatum: 'Either you approve my text or I will retain unlimited powers', which should otherwise expire once the new constitution is approved.
And in this strange atmosphere, 85 deputies of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly yesterday, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was promulgated, they slammed the door, saying that they had no way of asserting their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their move.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 substitutes were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators went on to point out that one of the few controversies that day revolved around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee were of the opinion that the clock in the meeting room was not properly adjusted.
The text voted on as recently as yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains identical to the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law shall be the primary source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental demands, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," argue liberals, who see it as nothing more than a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular on issues of checking the conformity of laws with Sharia law.
According to Sophie Pommier, an expert on Egypt, this is disturbing because "those called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen as the beginnings of a theocracy."
Liberals' fears are further fueled by the fact that the university's next president should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamas but university workers, many of them studied in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a paper on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be disagreements over the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used in it belong to religious vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question may arise to what extent civil judges are competent to have a say on this."
In addition to the religious aspects, the text approved yesterday is highly criticised because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that they have been significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of military officials, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, trials of civilians will not be banned in military courts, as requested by human rights groups.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to a text which they consider to be directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, points out Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In its view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to address a televised address last night, rallies are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the navel of the world and the sea made of a saturated salt solution are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort, and the untouched nature of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bowing to Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God's mercy descends on all who enter this "bath."
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling with nets.
Here also Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
The faithful will walk through the Way of Sorrows or the Way of Jesus (Via Dolorosa in Latin).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 BC.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountaineering can get to it with their own hands.
Others will be taken to this historic mountain by cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
His canvases include the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acre, you can visit the museum-baths of Al Basha, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with dummies of bath users and spa keepers from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dali and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You step inside - and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars glitter.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Dead Seas.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is possible to bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the most peculiar sea in the world, it is located at the lowest land point of the planet - at the level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and healing mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to heal disheveled nerves.
Touch the mysterious distant past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love to wander through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the aisle of "your" sign, luck will be favorably inclined to you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for a word
Going to Israel, you can not worry about its imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
On the way, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 shekels).
Public transport is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is served by high-speed trams, and Haifa is the country's only metro line with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper one.
Basically, it is an underground funicular railway.
Travel by all public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel 1.5 hours with a change.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, work stops at markets, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you get only kosher food: except pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many fattened cats that gracefully "roam according to their taste".
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Spinning cats love crowded places and enjoy any delicacy.
Car rental will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day, depending on the car brand.
Plus insurance - $ 15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to explore the country and relax.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
The "great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money for language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling "forged" certificates
13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass an exam in knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal management, lifestyle and retail.
However, the FMS promises that in time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the basics of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and renew a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Even people who successfully managed to obtain attestation and obtain an academic diploma before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to this law.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; already today more than 160 such centers are opened in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by deputies of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the question many times in the press: what will this actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service reply, this will make it possible to reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan.
Protection of their rights should start before their departure.
Only a system of organised recruitment will make it possible to solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, says Sebelev with conviction, the would-be migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of help, will provide him with a "voucher" to terrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others like himself will languish for months without food or documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland, they promise them one thing, but upon arrival they cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Tajik Directorate of Labor Migration at the MS.
Don't swear!
Still less so because many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they want to get to, but they do not even have experience with the job.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children with something, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, dressed and equipped for school decently.
As children reach working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the law on language examinations, human rights defenders point out one important point.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't, they won't take exams or get any other official jobs.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Forbidden"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we basically have false documents, without registration, and this results in cases of blackmail.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists about his experience a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was discovered that not only migrants' registration documents were false.
FMS employees have already confiscated several fake certificates of passing a language exam.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times higher than passing the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to secure the system against corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests the first time needed time to take a course in the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealings with people are not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The MVD of Russia is proposing to tighten the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the impetus was the shooting at weddings, which went without victims, and the massacre prepared by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people died.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which a license to carry weapons can be obtained from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter has appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, said in an interview with the BBC's Russian bureau.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while for the same period a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening legislation on civilian weapons will not force the offender to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon at a low price can currently be found in Moscow.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept gun orders
The first of them - "army or military way", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security officials.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses as well as weapons stolen directly from law enforcement employees.
Illegal "barrels" get into sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It's proven that some of the fires were started deliberately to cover up shortages," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, weapons manufacturers also bring their contribution.
"At present, private arms companies are being set up that are not competitive on the international market, and they are phasing out the weapons they supply to the black market, including in Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and automatic machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"That's where they are produced, sometimes weapons are made on a small-scale basis, and a mafia was formed to organize their smooth production," the former soldier explains.
Where is the weapon from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of individual sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Statistical Service, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons ended up on the black market "through the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases weapons were stolen during their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology".
A consultant salesman at one of the gun shops, who asked that we not give his name, is convinced that the weapons found in excavations by black "archaeologists" are no longer bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, vendors go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through the ensign, the interested person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever their crime plan catches fire, they make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers," the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I used to visit websites and blogs until a guy came along and offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Trial" platform where there would be a man who would lead me to a "corner" where we would negotiate with each other.
I learned the price of the barrel only there
Military correspondent Viktor Baranets
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, says the salesman-adviser.
There are sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to settle that my daughter's tooth had fallen out."
And now I'm going to get there through a person I'm sure of.
He will also supply them only to me, because He knows that I will not denounce Him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90s, when he was working on an article for a publication on this topic.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
They gave him an album with photos that said "everything you could think of."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets, do not offer a pig in a poke - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller into the forest and we build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we start acting," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa tray
Search engines on the Internet will take you to websites and groups on "Vkontakt", where it offers to buy a gun "for various purposes".
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required for this.
"It is enough to have a set amount of money," reads the advertising headline on the website "Buy a combat pistol or automatic".
On these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Without a license, of course," asks user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"I'll buy a TT. Moscow" - briefly formulates the demand "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently smashed a huge network of front websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can rake with a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish for bait and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military dignitary Viktor Baranets
I've heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment via an ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions where the gun is hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the NGO "Right to Arms."
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $ 100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will usually pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to Arms", you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The gun is dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage through mid-link warehouses.
According to the official Statistical Service, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers on strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through work at the cash desk of "McDonald's" establishments
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has risen in Walmart hypermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
The whole event is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the meager pay increases that ordinary workers at Walmart and fast-food systems receive, the goal of the protest organizers is to create them in their unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called "Black Friday," when an of cheap sales hit America, engulfing millions and in some cases accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with unions and left-wing activists of multinational chain stores whose goods are intended for people from the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk all over the world.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only shop at their place of work.
The availability and assortment of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because it pays its employees so little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or handheld scanners.
"Black Friday" protesters demanded pay rises and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company had risen sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker is paid $9.5 an hour, but that's not commensurate with expenses, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That's an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart shifts the wage increase entirely onto consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend approximately $12.39 more than today.
Walmart's advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should cause virtually no harm to the company.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
In total, its coffers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Company representative Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website that a total of "fewer than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was "another media sensation" orchestrated by the union.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart department stores (which are not very popular in the progressive city and therefore almost are not there), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even pay you sick pay and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work under federal law and New York state regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only slightly, and on average their regular workers in New York are paid $8.90 an hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Employment at "McDonald's" goes through nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time behind the counter after school and live with their parents.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for long.
At present, I constantly meet in conversation with "McDonald's" workers who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday outside "McDonald's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast-food outlets begin receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of trade unions and punishing union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is also difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food outlets for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high staff turnover.
Disagreement
On that day, noisy protests were also held in a number of other budget Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of this event was a rally at noon at "McDonald's" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, notably city council member Jumaane Williams, spoke and said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even pay you sick pay and it doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must stand together in support of fast-food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, although not all of them were fast food employees, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become the spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has been deceived mediocrely"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies, the topic of augmented reality is popular; Recently, this means perceiving the world mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At its annual conference earlier this summer, Google demonstrated a working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed for the patent.
An interview with Sharam Izadi, head of Microsoft's interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge Lab, shows that for the company's scientists, glasses are a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in general terms what your research group does?
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Meanwhile, humanity is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is on sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone there is a very interesting option to control with gestures.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, a lot of interactions still take place on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow is not yet very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, for this it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
This is a popular thing, but is it not overrated?
- It certainly cannot be considered a panacea - the issue of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not sweeping, just such stingy, short ones.
The gestures would not be captured by the device's camera, but by a bracelet that would track the movements of bones and muscles.
So far, it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future has a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- And how?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at any given moment?
- This is not necessary at all, but it is a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - this is what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels themselves, but as matrices and depth.
Looking at things today, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we must bear in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
So the speed, the number of frames per second, is also very important.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and current data streams of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a bit low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now used in Kinect, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually a common visible band sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of an object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations performed.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play with the curvature of camera placement, and see how it helps in determining three-dimensional positioning.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don't you think that when it comes to the day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around while constantly holding the smatphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a "portable" form of reality augmentation, where it would be possible to switch at any time from glasses to a smartphone, projection screen and further around based on the clouds platform.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, this is their strength (private things can be seen only by you), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of background for imaging.
Excellently records compressions!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding tangibility to these "images in the air" – for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located produces a tactile sensation, but it is still very faint – as if you were blowing on your fingertips.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think that he feels what he seems to feel in the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here there is yet another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very confined space to believe that he is walking through open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), a moving platform and also huge balls.
If deception of the brain becomes the goal, then the work is still for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers – many things are in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the head, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already important figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, without achieving pan-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and vernissages.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets brings a smile to the faces of citizens, raises everyone's spirits.
He recently picked up the organ grinder and became a St. Petersburg organ grinder, because he had matured into this complex role with his bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city all in red and not in yellow or, for example, turquoise?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although, in general, everything that is even slightly different from gray arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is first and foremost an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you have to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture on Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my path was.
At that time, a wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I made friends with the artists of the New Wave, with the post-Gazonevskys, who brought us to the "Pushkinskaya 10", and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theater, dress, music, all genres except the word.
- And all this merged in your art-clinic ...- For me it was important to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a place at 10 Pushkinskaya Street, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg bohemia, before the reconstruction.
There a lot was born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how they brought Snur with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Šcord and his friends sang light songs under plywood, dressed in tight-fitting leotards, in the middle between them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, they became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, and he received his basic education and vocational training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboyedov - this is the reverberation of the Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests left.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized was in the press, a special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named me, that was the end of my peak.
In the new times according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity today are different things, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and incisiveness are vividly captured.
I will have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today to be like that is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is blurred, tragedy is taken.
I love slapstick, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today, people meet by clothing, orienting themselves to the external mechanics, not to the inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by disguise.
- We recently saw you in the role of the city organ grinder.- A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, applied arts should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people met in groups, bohemia loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-companies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you will like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
- Female fans come to him, where the sexual and social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural ground and 10,000 don't, and the result is less management, less money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one fools them and breaks what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on a collector's wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money because of drawing pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is lacking in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper tsars this was not the case in everything, the tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked away in a corner because we need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, tasteful language is thriving.
The same Erarta, but differing in that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our fallow land, art is doing poorly.
We need cultural ground, but in our country today there are more writers than readers, that is wrong.
In Europe there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Giving birth in space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board embark on a journey, looking for an alternate planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep their species in weightlessness or on a given alternate planet?
I think the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be mastered, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a high-ranking scientist at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (SAISH).
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the issues of reproduction in space, scientists began with flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their terrestrial relatives.
After that, the launch of insects into orbit was carried out - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to see how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem arises with the fact that this bird has to find a foothold, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they do not find a foothold, the birds fall chaotically and do somersaults.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds experienced a complete extinction of instincts.
The birds did not react to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they simply perished within four days.
"We let birds hatch twice, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev comments on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "mini-ark" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But in the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already pregnant when sent into space.
Basically, they didn't discover anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be conducted," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on earth, offspring was born to space rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It is a difficult task.
Animals in the loss of the usual habitat simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that humanity has is a female body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would withstand the flight into space.
Whether she can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered that question yet," says rocket and space industry veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolaev.
In 1988, a son was born to the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts who have been born and grow healthy offspring after many years.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even during orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably find new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in conditions with zero gravity, astronauts acquire the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although for adults water is a comfortable but strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
Small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land originated in the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the baby is in the mother's amniotic fluid for an average of 9 months and that it is easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little for a child to forget something," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for a newborn baby, then inevitable gravity, an attractive force, is more natural for women.
In weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles very quickly wither, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can leave this aside if the stimulators of muscle activity during childbirth will work.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What's next?" asks Valery Polyakov the difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the Earth's gravity does not act on the body, it will not be able to properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment," predicts the head of the IBMP RAN Bioethics Commission, Igor Pestov.
So childbirth in space is only a theoretical question today.
However, there will come a time when it will become a reality and when Earthlings will set off in their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
SAO chief: Control of the Švarc system failed through the fault of politicians
The Czech Republic has good inspectors and high-quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it lags behind in its application.
Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, says this in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what I think is missing in our country," Kala said.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by a joint inspection of Czech and German auditors.
As an example of incorrect practice, he cites Petr Nečas's approach to the so-called "Švarc system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its inspections - is it therefore prohibited or permitted?
"After all, the law must be set up somehow, and if he prohibits something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the activities of an office that has the duty to go to check and enforce duties," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, within which legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We put all this together, and although the inspection is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences - generally speaking, legislation in our country is perhaps "stricter and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to pay attention to the actual application of the law.
What can this project actually help you for, what does it mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to refine laws, reduce and improve limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Thrift means obtaining the appropriate thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, in order to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by lowering the contract limit, we don't necessarily achieve that.
Perhaps the system will be overloaded with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw from it much more easily than if the limit remained higher.
You talk about domestic problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof works there as the SAO, which is organised similarly to us, it also has a college, but it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices proceed similarly.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, it also has these courts of audit at the level of the individual Länder - this is where the system differs a little from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented in our country by state resources.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities in our country, are audited there from the level of the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for the legislation there, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it has to be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would not be of any benefit to them to cooperate with our office, right?
As far as domestic legislation is concerned, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are its impacts already manifested?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet reflected in our control actions.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, there is a certain delay to be expected.
So far, we have only observed this in the process of preparing future inspections - we have launched our new tool "detection of risks of inefficiency", through which we have swept almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there the changes will naturally be reflected, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tenders will be adjusted, and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden on the system by bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "tightened" and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already during the operation of the previous rules, the inspected persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) to the fact that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it worth tightening up the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal errors that have no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how to get out of it?
Let's see where the road does not lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called "Švarc system" - and what does this mean?
Is the Švarc system forbidden or allowed?
After all, the law must be set up somehow, and if he prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister can prevent the activities of an office that has the duty to go and check and enforce duties.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to do nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, there are relatively strict rules on how things are to be formally carried out - which is right, in order to protect the public tender.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is missing in our country.
The roads are icy in places, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are icy and also snowy.
Mostly, however, the roads are passable, sometimes with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable this morning, but in places icy and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm up slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the region and there is only a thin layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimetres of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
In some places, visibility was also lower due to fog, according to data from the dispatch center of regional road workers.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads are now passable without restrictions in the region.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be icy and slippery.
All second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
On them, however, in some sections still lie the remains of frozen and in places traveled snow.
Especially at higher altitudes, it is necessary to pay close attention to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Regions
There is a risk of frost on some roads in eastern Bohemia, and at higher altitudes and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate informs on its website.
Road workers warn drivers of icing, which can form especially in the higher altitudes of the Pardubice Region.
Ice can be around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
The snow layer is at the highest altitudes on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today is mostly clear to partly cloudy without precipitation.
Temperatures are usually between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a light wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but sometimes with increased caution and driving must be adapted to the weather.
It is freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some roads may be frozen.
In some places, drivers have to count on fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is based on information from the dispatching center of regional road workers.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, but increased caution is recommended by road administrators between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In the southern Pilsen and Tachov regions, however, there may be icy sections.
Second and third class roads are damp and icy sections are also in this case.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest altitudes of the Olomouc Region must now count on snow slurry on the road.
After chemical spreading it remained on Červenohorské sedlo and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Road workers were driven into the terrain by snow at night, in the Šumperk region, according to road administrators, about three centimeters of snow.
In other parts of the region, the roads are mostly passable without restrictions.
"In the Šumperk region, there are remnants of snow at the highest altitudes.
Drivers must count on snow slurry on Červenohorské sedlo in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Šumperk Road Administration told CTK today.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník region also went to the field at night, the roads to the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc region, roads are passable without restrictions, but in the Šternberk region, drivers should be careful in forest sections where the roads remained damp.
Usti Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult places to pass are reported this morning by road workers in northern Bohemia.
In addition to a few places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of glaciers is reported by road workers mainly from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and melting snowfall during the day, clear and frosty at night.
Adverse conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent tree branches that bent to the road under the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world coming in less than a month?
It's just one more scaremongering that we humans like to grab hold of.
Together with The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also organize an absolutely unique project called Three Concerts Against the End of the World.
Can you introduce it to readers?
It is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items, shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by buying on www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap band, along with other artists, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Canceled".
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will suddenly be interconnected in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words to this song were written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, as we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world go to?
To equip the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for six years with the Tap civic association in the Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute schools are regularly visited by lecturers and devote themselves to activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several bands and performers.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found on www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" in the future?
In May, we will perform at the Prague Spring Festival for the first time, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests here as well.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the USA, I would like to combine it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not minimalist, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It is not as terrible as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric wheelchair, their trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we carry a large amount of cargo and crates with tools...
However, so far it has always been managed without any problems, CSA and British Airways were so well prepared for us that I was often surprised.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individual ones differ in barrier-free accessibility, public access to the handicapped and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still at its very beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to move alone in the city center.
There are no such commonplaces as giving way to a wheelchair user in an elevator.
Fortunately, civic associations are already emerging there that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things where we are still behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that even people with severe disabilities move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are a bit ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being wheelchair accessible is one thing, but it's only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers that things really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of strong-willed people.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let's go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so together with a colleague I founded a music hobby group.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a bit out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work on promoting the band.
We realized that work that is not visible basically does not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford high-quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to take The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something differently.
Show business is full of things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is accepted cautiously and takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that is natural...
But that pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all abandoned beings that we have to pity.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means to do so.
I say that when people with disabilities succeed in something, it is not just a shift for them, but for the whole society.
Has this success been helped by being a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their heads in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend prep and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there when it started in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovic.
We are an open group, people come and go, this cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and desire, always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 pm
It will take place in Prague Incheba arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynoj with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will connect by telebridge while singing together the song of The Tap Tap band "The End of the World Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the volume of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free admission tickets in advance Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, the second country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has been involved in a number of ESA projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had been involved in space flights before the Second World War; But they did not always meet with understanding.
I will recall, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, who on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entry into Cosmonautics.
The thoughts of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsche Prize for Entry into Space in France.
The above-mentioned doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of astronautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway trolley was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the design is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was intended to be used to start the trolley or to brake it.
Information about this trolley is known only from the period press.
Since 1933, Polish artillery began to deal with rocket missiles.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the surviving materials that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, a proposal for a photoelectric fighter rocket designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the work Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated all the projects of military use of rocket technology.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activity was terminated by the start of war.
Other works devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The company was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problem magazine, which contained four more extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with astronautics.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn the PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a ceiling of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next development type should already be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a ceiling of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the altitude wind.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, there was a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 liters.
The maximum ceiling for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aerospace Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch mass of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Abolishing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic formations, national economic systems, stand in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labour (wages), price tensions occur.
That term must be understood as a situation in which a producer tries to compete by importing cheap goods by 'undercutting' a competitor's price in order to gain a larger market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or to buy there cheaply, or to disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is aggravated by the complete unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused by society as a whole in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to give specific statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital at the risk of their own populations, regardless of social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes in applicable laws.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done both through a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and through the restriction of workers' rights in the area of labour law.
The result is rising poverty, along with an increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food dispensaries for the poor who cannot support themselves by their own work for many years.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for duly employed people to receive such a wage that the state has to pay them up to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of the auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
Austerity measures in virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to languish on the margins of society on starvation wages, hoping that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But here it is necessary to ask, where will it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, or a Turk, a Moroccan, or an Egyptian, or an African, still works for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim ad nauseam that the state cannot participate in capital in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state must not intervene in the economy through management intervention.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now actually directs politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the unequivocal answer that yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the areas of corruption, mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is reprehensible but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to lack of funds, outsource the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are often connected with industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power thus does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions proclaim, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly finding themselves in the situation described by Appian in his The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in complete disrepair, and offices were occupied by force.
For bribes, illegal gaining favor and with stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote" ..."people of character did not run for office at all, so that once, as a result of this disruption, the state was without consuls for eight months." .." Indeed, it began to be said that the only remedy in a bad situation was autocracy, and that it was necessary to elect an energetic man." Appian thought of Pompey, but it was Caesar who turned democracy into autocracy permanently.
Conclusion: As in antiquity, contemporary society is based on a ruthless preference for self-interest, regardless of society-wide interest.
Private capital, by its very nature, is incapable of understanding and asserting the benefit of society as a whole.
The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites without any attempt at deeper reforms.
The causality of the rise of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As it stands, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-style democracy can be seen as a pause in anticipation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters in the future, along with crimes against humanity as we know them from both old and modern history.
Abolishing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and intra-European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing comes of violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile, whose main line in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a lot of reactions.
Some stand with Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and portraying the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing the racism of the Israeli state, genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit and who is the victim in the periodically recurring waves of killings, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a glimpse of who is primarily served by 95 years of tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reasoning is supported by available historical facts, some are derived from them based on my own understanding of who, respectively, which group of people is the prime mover of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who completely autonomously directed their steps or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and that this concentration of money and the power that flows from it could not have taken place in the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families, one stands out that could be considered the head of an octopus (whether anyone is still standing above them I don't know, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschieldes.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) in the 90s of the 19th century to stop associating their name with the highly criminal acts behind which they stood and which for them always meant the consolidation of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks in the world, and wars are being fought or prepared against countries that do not have shares in the central bank (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore central bank status to Rothschieldo's Bank of America, began issuing his own money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, and Rep. Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after suing the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by a Mason of the highest degree, 33rd degree initiation, Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of eliminating large monarchical state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury is enough and they do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a precursor for such a solution) and the final assumption of absolute power.
The method that a group of the wealthiest families, led by the Rothschields, is working to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Federal Reserve to avoid a repeat of crises like the one they provoked in 1907).
So, after they succeeded in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the R-U throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, the bankers let politicians create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was foist on the Germans a sufficiently strong, culprit-branding and simple solution offering a Führer, and by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play.  And it also played the function of a fifth column in igniting the conflagration of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist Movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the preconditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler broke free from the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or everything he did was planned is difficult to guess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and just as war reparations made Germany prepare for World War 2, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focus of the Third War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the latter, will be victims on the front lines of the fighting, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (just consider how sharply divided people are between supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers foist only their own candidates on people to choose from.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, politician who is doing everything to unleash a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all the world's oil travels (the navigation corridor is only 2 miles wide), the destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 now appear: "All we need is a general crisis and the people will agree to a new world order."
The New World Order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes them a totally controlled being.
"And he compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, that he may not buy or sell who is not marked with the name of the beast or the numeral of his name.
This must be understood: whoever has reason should add up the numbers of the beast.
That number denotes a man, and it's a number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the US, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would fundamentally jeopardize the trust of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages was not achieved in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later exacerbated by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their plight has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Directed by actor Ben Affleck, Argo, describes an episode in that history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled it.
After complicated twists and turns, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew that inspected the locations for the filming of a sci-fi blockbuster in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time a so-called "caper movie", a story of a successful stunt, a sneak peek - an example is a series of Danny's sidekicks.
On the one hand, documentary-style sequences from Tehran change in the film (the title sequence shows iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, lighter passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed a career restart in remarkable fashion.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The City (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that is not set in the director's home town of Boston.
A sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that elevated the director's older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is showing it in Argos, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history suddenly moves somewhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake crew at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many things happen in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story being told does not actually offer much in the cinematic sense of thrilling scenes.
He works with it quite successfully, sometimes adding something to reality - everything does not work out so elegantly there (the scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America and a chase down the runway seems rather far-fetched).
But Argo's weakness is the restlessness resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming as Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic thrust, a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciating the realization and retro style evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
But it's hard to pull down.
But it will suffice to remind us of a history that is still somewhat alive and a proof of how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and omniscient secret services are.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually announces a poll on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU".
"We were led to this by the last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey, told Pravo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women have been favoured in the prices of life insurance policies because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory blending of biofuels into fuels, which is harmful to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of a dangerous substance, and a directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Previously, he also faced criticism for a de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové máslo or the exclusion of incandescent bulbs from sale.
Quality bananas should have 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often makes decisions under the pressure of one or another business or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now enforces the demands of its banks with the threat of a veto).
The interests of the Lobby were also behind the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality in the Union had to be at least 14 cm long and could not show 'anomalous curvature'.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it was only harmonizing existing inconsistent national standards that had complicated trade.
The EU has already softened standards on fruit and vegetables, despite opposition from some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which inflatable balloons sold must be warned that children under 8 years of age must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU cited American research showing that balloons among toys are the leading cause of death for children from suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing into fairground frkaky.
Curious ideas are born even at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia due to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated for the survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU set the maximum volumes of food stocks that could be located in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of awarding subsidies to apply for a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was harvested in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state should have full warehouses that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the fact that the Czech Republic is further away from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission accommodated the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to municipalities by the Ministry for Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically they were supposed to go to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to make the functioning and development of the whole Union more effective deserve recognition, according to many experts.
According to experts, a more serious problem is, for example, drawing EU subsidies for projects that have no idea to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced by member states during budget negotiations.
Emotions among Czechs are also aroused by the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, and it does not always succeed in this struggle.
Although the Czechs defended the name of Olomouc Tvarůžky after a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, our producers had to rename the domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century.
Only products made from cane spirit and not from sugar beet may bear the name rum.
The official list of registered EU products in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany or Parma ham has already included Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelický and Třeboň carp and Žatec hops.
The EU trademark can also be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice rolled wafers.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does one get the idea that he wants to run for president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country stealing for the last twenty years, thieves running around, increasing taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm already forty and an independent non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Aren't you turning your back on the people who elected you?
I have said all along that I will go into the fight for the Castle according to the result in the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for making my visions come true.
That is why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The trouble is not only that as a nation we curse in the pub and on TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
Add to this the media, which denigrates people and confuses freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was said about me that I bribed journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You set out for the battle for the Castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive property declarations over twenty million.
To do this, you need to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for guiding to be a free trade, I managed to push it through.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, it is deliberately rejected, and this delays citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party pigeonholing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
For me, it doesn't matter at all whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it's important that we go forward.
I don't care whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSCM or ODS, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone calls you a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by eminent experts.
But without the support of parliament, all you have to do is slogans.
And that's not enough in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing criminal and material liability?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to get it through.
If I were elected President, there would be no problem in organising a live television broadcast where I would ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to say why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who names abuses, one can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, that was due to public pressure.
I say frankly that I am an amateur, that I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to get majority support for my program.
I try to move things myself, if it doesn't work, in six years I will quit and return to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that I will not do anything in one person, so I went around a number of well-known people to see if they would also run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least that is how I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud with light fuel oil.
I ran because people were really unhappy, but now I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and those who did mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to check every potential partisan's background, and I don't have the money to do so.
I don't even have money for a presidential campaign, there are only 20,000 in my transparent account.
No money?
You're talking about asset declarations, what's yours?
I estimate private equity at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against bad things and abuses.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have assets worth 60 million and have no money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for a campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that there is probably not so much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
Basically, my campaign costs will be covered by what senator's salary I receive.
But I would not live on it, for example, I would not be able to pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I just want to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business to live?
Didn't you say you would tone down these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who would save the Republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much were you used to earning per month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take further.
And if I were president, I would shut down my business.

The architects of MVRDV are proof that real adventures do not just take place in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"I find the building cheerful, it looks futuristic. There's finally something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, walking by the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large nearby company, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
However, I ask why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one volunteers to visit any of these old-style libraries anymore, does they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own, which is not even worth visiting, holds a special record.
This municipality of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was taken to contribute to universal education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of the fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councillors realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of insanely bold bar charts and a maker of witty, often cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm and appeared at the 2003 competition with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around in amazement and shrugging its shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled his presents on top of each other according to size and ended his activist-reasoned speech with the words, "Dear city community!"
So this is my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was piled up for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The grey small-town landscape, which has so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white façade you would expect a dairy, is thus richer with a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: a reader's Eldorado under a cheese cover.
Although there is an elevator through the middle of the mountain massif, you will discover the real spatial and reading passions only when hiking the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear on all sides, the burnt cabron floor and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, there are bookshelves along the façade and in the middle is a big dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader's space from the inside out.
The interior of the Book Mountain is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and a switchboard.
A special pleasure is the black shelves for books, which are sometimes wall paneling, once parapet, and sometimes stair railings.
The appearance, texture and smell feel foreign.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so, one day, in a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, millimetre fleece made of synthetic material has been used as a substrate under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is inexpensive and time efficient.
Thin textiles last for one or two seasons and then are ripe for disposal in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantities - was pressed into plates four centimeters thick.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the top.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long journey, you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly of the correct humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite its many glass surfaces, this house is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled by the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glazed façade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
Fully automatic roller shutters can handle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate a book from their personal collection.
First, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently numbers 70,000 pieces, were to be filled.
The concept has proven successful.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
In this way, MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated it is.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a bigger role'
Germany abstained in deciding on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, Berlin is teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think they will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the issue of establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually pushed through by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is in the process of changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was, so to speak, controlled by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still settling into their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or Great Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows readiness to adopt positions in the case of national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
In any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany's relations with the US suffer from abstaining on both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding for the German position.
Therefore, I do not think that it was such a dramatic turning point as on the issue of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This signals that it must be regarded as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly spoken out in favor of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic politics.
I think that the Obama administration probably secretly has a great deal of sympathy for the European position.
But, of course, as a result of the political situation there, he cannot hold this position publicly.
I think that the differences of opinion are really not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the EU's most important partners, on the other?
I think that is exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at present.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, if only because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he even want to take the lead role?
Or is leadership still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and it is still difficult for this country to play a major role for obvious reasons.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, anti-German sentiment arises.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
US influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum. Who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a designation that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they continue to enjoy protection until they are sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is unclear whether they will claim the right.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a firm specializing in trademark infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to register their brands.
For example, Gucci will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they will register Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied in this way.
Pattloch opens the binder with the records of the stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma trademark protected. An artificial name that parasitizes even on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores, in which counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
But Pattloch's cases are different. On behalf of its clients, it is proceeding against Chinese companies being officially granted the right to use a sign that is already protected elsewhere by the trademark office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an affiliate brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
By this we mean women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting business, we have to fight it," Pattloch said.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusivity disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs for the affected industries run into the millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to data from market research firm CLSA, with a volume of €15 billion per year, China is the third largest luxury market and the fastest growing market.
However, deleting dubious entries in the register of signs is difficult to achieve and comes at a cost.
The proceedings can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed lawsuits because the name had become a "market reality" after a long time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, they still have to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Known cases also apply to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion merchandise maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
CTMO admits that there were deficiencies in 2010 due to too few staff and premises.
But last year, "the course of the work process reportedly returned from an emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of pending objection procedures fell by 22 percent.
57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Despite this, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Doing something about it is expensive
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were received by CTMO, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China leads the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected in fees.
Put simply, each login costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times as much to start a dispute against this, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The Germans managed to abolish its illegal production of imitated car parts.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget it ourselves, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
CTMO also rejected the Munich company's objection.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg won the law, but the opponent continues to fight in the dispute to this day.
You have to be terribly careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that he will bring the case to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archives, they even had to look through hundred-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg vainly offered the counterparty a "high six-figure sum in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You can see what it means to us," says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East threatens to reach Europe as well.
And that's if the imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for footwear and leather in Germany.
The concern gave up this area of business activity a long time ago, yet it managed to avert registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch advise German businesses to be very cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law. Instead, foreigners should "register anything worth protecting in China in any way," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs in the final act of its brand drama, then it may have to pay royalties to the counterparty for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in a disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, orphans of parents who have died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of a connection that covers much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there's the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball boots, women's pumps and men's moccasins search the dance floor for tact and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then, slowly, the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - surge, press, wave and chase each other.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf is almost lifted out of his textile shoes as he connects his voices with his supple wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers between the ages of 23 and 69 came, ranging from a researcher of human genetics to a caretaker.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir voice has a different lyric and in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that there are roughly 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans of parents who have died of AIDS in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is already HIV positive.
For 180 orphans of parents who died of AIDS in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take patronage.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "one who praises" in the Zulu language.
Fluent Bantu is not spoken in this space but sung.
For almost a decade, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, sometimes bringing them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the power of the voices of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud or straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjeni, the whole of Swaziland can be seen in small ways: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity. It is not uncommon for them to die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the congregation during a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without completing their schooling, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, which for a few euros a year made it possible to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since cared for orphans of parents who died of AIDS almost professionally.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Moths and scabies belong to parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydial infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of those newly infected with HIV are in this group.
Among juveniles, chlamydial infections occur significantly more often than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among juveniles in our country.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms warn of a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can I protect myself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't offer one hundred percent protection.
Because the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the royalties that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
"In total, we have already sent around €200,000 to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
The money from Germany is managed in the village itself by Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
She also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, for example with one of their grandmothers.
Gogo, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the mainstay of the village.
Some of them have taken 14 orphans, given them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children arrive on time for school every day in uniform.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to a shelter with Khanyisila, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get HIV tests.
This is not a matter of course. Although the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually quite strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his immoderate lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned way of life is partly to blame for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that while condoms are free on every corner, "nobody uses them.
The culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi travels together every two or three years in southern Africa and sings songs full of grief, combativeness, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but has also already shed tears among many fierce border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children, over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, it is more than famous in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometres as the crow flies, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science."
Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the planet's permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
But let's not link the ice finding to the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, the lead scientist working on the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help shed light on how water and other basic elements of life reached other regions of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved by Earthlings, are participating in the exploration of the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to the Earth, small windows into the endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition.
This excerpt from Spitzer's infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, less identifiable are the pink-colored "newborns" in the delivery room of the stars.
This star-forming region — scientists unromantically call it W5 — was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia 6500 light-years away.
This changing heat of the dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The muffin ring consists of material ejected by the star during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
The photograph of the galactic cradle was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may appear red-eye to an observer in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to the terrestrial continent has earned this nebula the name North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the source of an extraordinary coloring.
This "baby" among the stars could be fully captured by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps they are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest Hubble images: the vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become real works of art according to their coloring.
The image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula, several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trigeminal), because dark streaks of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar nursery into three parts.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are rushing towards each other and a collision is bound to occur.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not like technical abbreviations, can call it the nickname South Pinwheel.
A Hubble Space Telescope image shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
This 1400-light-year nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to hundreds of times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to new additions all the time.
These stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are also giving birth to new young stars. They are 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe it formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was predominantly hydrogen.
Our views of the Universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei, a year later he used it to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become larger and larger - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is a Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured with a hook at an altitude angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists are searching space for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner can help by making its computing power available.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope stands here - and lives up to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
An extremely large European telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should have a full 42 meters and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be expected in 2018 at the earliest.
The two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also peers into space with the Subaru Telescope and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea is to build a new giant telescope - with a thirty-meter diameter mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the most significant impressions of the universe are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He has been providing us with images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been identified since the mission began.
The image documents the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that Mercury is ice.
Launched in 2004 and the first to orbit Mercury, Messenger, scientists now have confidence.
Drink butter daily and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysh Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along a winding road along densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems like we are in the Black Forest.
However, this here is the extreme south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group Talysh, about whom little is known, except that they speak perfect Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts overly monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Getting there from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
Eight hours are needed for 323 kilometres, as the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, believes Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest in May – and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of nearly eight dozen Talysh people from the area, who are more than a hundred years old. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he fathered a child.
The disputed star of the museum, however, is sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So wasn't Şirali Müslümov a few decades wrong at his age?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, had also heard of aged people in Central Asia.
"A striking number of elderly people also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely many very old men living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific proof of age can be given, especially in the absence of registers.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik live to the biblical age remarkably often.
Currently, there are 20 individuals who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many old people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatuljeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem very plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzaeva.
At 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butter churn, which he relentlessly rocks.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter. Both have long been grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses "armadu".
Mirzaeva's white teeth form a perfect line, and under the scarf she hides long dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk so it didn't fall out and kept its color.
"I've also never used shampoo," Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought groceries in a supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the oar.
Propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is being built around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not destitute.
Mirzayeva receives a pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros) every month. That is an amount that you can live on well by local standards.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-grayed son is right: "Old people are held in high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for and happy.
Unless that's a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" is absent from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo have exposed the country's deep divisions.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is hotly debated.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And I am responsible for the fact that we succeed, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly quarrelling in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a "state of God" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said almost apologetically that he had temporarily limited the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from Southern California University, really wants to save is not clear to Egyptians and the world.
Should the judiciary be removed from power?
The 234 paragraphs that the hundred-headed Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly hastily approved in a fifteen-hour night marathon are partly worrying.
As in earlier constitutions, this bill says that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use this unclear formulation and the associated legal freedom for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least this is illuminated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, one should consult Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence over all of Sunni Islam.
This does not have to mean, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise supervision over legislation, which would bring the judiciary a de facto deprivation of legal capacity.
There is much to interpret in the draft constitution
It is also a problem that the civilian jurisdiction of military courts is to be preserved.
These courts served to suppress opposition under Mubarak.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The proposal also states that the state should protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values."
This is legally formulated so imprecisely that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature by means of this paragraph.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
Another article prohibits defaming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
What remains unclear, however, is what defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the formulation that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts enough in this case?
A matter of interpretation, like so much else in the bill, which Morsi will submit for signature and says he will present to Egyptians "very soon" for a popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks, opposition to the outnumbered Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unison in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday night and vowed to destroy the constitutional charter before it takes effect.
"The revolution has come back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution belonged "to the dustbin of history."
Through a short message service, Twitter accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition member Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a defiant demonstration, but out of caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters, who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called on Morsi: "Clean up the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like situation.
Morsi's supporters clearly did not want to risk this.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which way the country should go.
A majority in favor of the Islamists' proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur even once"
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, angers Hafez Abu Sa'da.
The forty-eight-year-old human rights defender and chairman of Egypt's Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the words 'human rights' are not even once in the new constitution," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's extension of power to all three branches of power in the state forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous violation of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: The smelliest fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for an extraordinarily smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Let it lie for a week.
This gives you a sense of smell that paralyzes rakfisk, one of Norway's greatest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a magnificent view - and a pervasive smell hangs in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, how to put it best, the most captivating food.
"You eat it raw and then drink it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter who is also the so-called "Rakfisk General" who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and wash them down with large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus journey.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when well fermented, they were pulled out and eaten—no doubt the senses were dulled by alcohol.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, most of whom emigrated to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
Residents of Sweden, an old rival that not long ago was much richer than Norway, flock to the country in search of work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, if rather stinky, part of Norway's past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although expensive is everything – a small glass of beer or a sandwich will set you back £9 ($14) apiece.
Norway does not often make it into the global news - and it seems that most of the population is happy with that.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned grudgingly.
Instead, the shooting is called the "July 22 event."
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind the current wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 70s of the twentieth century.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes is the prototype of Nordic prosperity as she serves plates of aged rakfisk.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
Her English, like the English of most people here, is impeccable.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway is handling its oil wealth very carefully - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else was throwing money they didn't have in the years leading up to the global financial crash, the Norwegians had the strings tightened on their purse.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in line in the snow for something to eat - I've had enough of rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening the smelly fish is here again.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests vote for the best, or rather the most demanding fish to smell.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast in which the presenter is with a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto gets off to a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected, closing several key routes into the capital and wreaking havoc on the roads.
The aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
They face a daunting task.
Mexico has done well economically under outgoing Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader are divided even in his old homeland, a populous and sprawling state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in a good way.
Citizens attribute to him the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city via one of the new motorways built by Pena Nieto. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that used to be here.
Plaques with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP for President Pena Nieto's party, the Party of Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so badly needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected of Enrique Pena Nieto within the party.
And he rejects the opposition's statements characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward person, very interested with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a great statesman and, above all, he is a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Tucked under highway overpasses, it resembles the suburbs of the Mexican capital itself.
And the problems in the self-governing municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help control drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly acute violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge garbage dump.
During Pena Nieto's time as governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez — a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, Pena Nieto's critics say that during his time in office, he failed to adequately address the problem of feminicide.
Worse, they accuse his leadership of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her tears.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body had been washed," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were marks of blows on him, and the postmortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which has a single word on it: "Justice."
However, this, the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But that can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sash that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has vowed to make them a priority for his tenure.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," said PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's time in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed based on Manning's abuse in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein, in cross-examining Private Manning at a preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing conducted at the defense request to dismiss the case against Manning for abuse while in custody, which is a sufficient sentence in itself, took place the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing, Defense Attorney Fein and Manning went through the forms officers filled out after meeting Manning at Quantico Detention Center, where he was held in a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional."
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly asked Manning about how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems verbally, and that officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would address them, but did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in January 2011 during a meeting with a commission assessing suicidal thoughts that he had expressed in a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime.
The military said it used this restrictive regime (one level below the suicide surveillance regime) for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to lift this injury prevention regime... so that I can enjoy the increased quality of life that I have seen," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once fainted because of the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very disheartening.
"My world has shrunk to the Arifjan base, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving in Quantico, he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell with no company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from outside the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about Private Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning about the allegations he made in Thursday's testimony that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during the morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
Under questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said he had decided from his guards' orders to put down the blanket he could cover, but admitted that no one had given him an order to put it away.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he had tried to show an officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use his underwear belt or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyer hopes the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and significantly reduce his sentence if he is convicted before a military court, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to see Manning plead guilty to lower offenses and fight the other charges because they are too extreme.
With hearings scheduled to begin this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations governing all arrestees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding an enemy, illegally causing intelligence documents to be published online, transmitting national security information, and stealing public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options there are.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; They remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived at the Immigrant Agenda Area where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and have been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic acronym, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
So later I ended up with the label "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use abbreviations.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of a conversation in that language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and lined up for "Extranjeros".
I thought about the moment this week when Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House.
On the agenda were the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are just as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada to create a trading bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has vowed to continue Mexico's war against drug cartels, though he has not provided any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with hostility.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to transfer half of Mexican territory to the United States under threat of arms.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, reminders are ubiquitous.
So a minute after a U.S. official says something even slightly critical about Mexico, you will hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about the Americans encroaching on their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's children step out onto the warpath.
And yet the real challenge for Mexico is its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There are a lot of those.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people to whom the country offers opportunities and others to whom it does not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we are now living the American dream, going to good schools, and having good jobs, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and see us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their view, is all about failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves now trapped behind the Silk Curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and traveled legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to complicate relations further, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia, as I learned during my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "makeshift ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should be telling our fellow Americans how wonderful it is to visit this country and putting pressure on political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Well.
So that is not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't sure it's a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexican Americans still resentment at the way their family members were treated in the much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such failure is futile.
Among the usual futile guesses about who started it, many buildings were reduced to rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even when Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will make their fight bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this may break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the November 21 ceasefire holds, this week's fighting has strengthened hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most deplorable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine currently controlled by its bitter rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists have gained more influence throughout the Arab world, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas. So is Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering Hamas people say the Islamic Crescent wraps around Israel, in the north from Lebanon, ruled by the Hezbollah party/militia, through Syria, where increasingly Islamic-leaning rebels may topple Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
Above all, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
The Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more susceptible to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be excluded by either Israel or America.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in a box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system proved its worth, and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as steadfast as ever. Many European countries also blamed Hamas for launching the latest round of violence.
Most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively calm from suicide bombers, thanks in part to a wall that encroaches on the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party allied itself with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
We'd better keep them behind that wall and punch them when they stick their heads out.
Hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
Even if the Islamists gaining power in Egypt and other countries have little love for Israel, their top priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
That President Morsi worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis, too, should look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are making the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody incursions against Gaza every few years to push back Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides are saying, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states where Israel cedes territory for security.
In the short term, there is some hope that a ceasefire will give outside pressure at least a little more influence to enforce the cause.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must work to stop arms shipments to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with parts of the country swapped and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders also need to push for agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has his share of getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant in his entry into the process.
This is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Ugly cigarette packaging laws come into force in Australia
On the unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, warnings for smokers and diseased body parts are depicted.
Australia's ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, replacing logos and brand colours with generic olive-green boxes with hideous pictures of diseased body parts and images of children and newborns sick as a result of their parents' smoking.
Apart from various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes from Saturday are the names of the brands, which are printed in the same small print.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
Australia's federal government says the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by depriving the habit of its appeal.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they will never start smoking.
"Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that the tobacco companies are trying to sell them along with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies claimed that the law would increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"There will be serious unintended consequences with this legislation," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring many more of these products to sell on Australian streets.
Another claims that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover disgusting packs had increased from almost zero sales two months ago when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal over the laws to the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new inventory.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a marketer in the tobacco industry and all you have left is this little space to promote your products, the online space is an unbeatable place for you to be in," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook conducted by the "average John".
We have to ask, is this just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the trouble to create this video, or is a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how it will deal with the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries trade significantly with Australia.
The CPC decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
Pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and put it back," says Victor El Hage, buying a box with a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there is only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that is my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack newsagents in central Sydney, says the uniform boxes make it harder for him to stack them.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, let's close the shop,'" he said, throwing up his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
On the last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in child development are increasingly coming up with praise for being bored.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don't have a chance to enjoy boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I will come back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription concerning boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After viewing the research literature and presenting the idea to a target audience of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was unable to do it".
Boredom is distinguished from apathy by the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that with apathy, there is no urge to do something.
He says that at the heart of boredom is "the disruption of the attention process associated with a bad mood and a sense of time slowly passing."
Boredom can be very reminiscent of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a journal article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while a third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but weren't sure why, and attributed the trouble to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distracted attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat boredom and keep people more physically attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom at some point - my flight delay, a roaring speaker, a particularly lengthy movie.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the "Boredom Proneness Scale" in the 80s.
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knows that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and teens aren't given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and use this energy to play the guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not in the long run.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this self-management is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we should not be too critical of it either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are away from the constant rattle of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for needing to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise goes off."
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon become legal across the state — possession of several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said he was riding with some friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, one day in September when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia — minor offenses punishable by $100 each fine — and set a trial date.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on location rather than law.
Hundreds of marijuana misdemeanors have already been dropped here and in Washington state, which has passed similar measures.
The police department has stopped charging adults aged 21 and older for possession of small amounts that will be legally permitted after the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have said they will continue with existing marijuana cases and are still charging people for possession.
At the same time, several cities in suburban Denver toward the western mountains are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This issue is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even regulators in Washington state are scratching their heads.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, leads most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent to follow," he said.
The Washington Act, the so-called Washington Act. I-502, takes effect on December 6, also leaving a year-long vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession will.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state's "appropriate access" directive to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis store than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers telling them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute misdemeanors for possession of small amounts of marijuana for any citizen over the age of 21, and that police would stop charging people for these crimes "effective immediately."
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many face additional charges.
"Our office has a duty to prosecute criminal offences that were crimes at the time they were committed," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response was complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest town, no longer charge adults with possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports the decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the conflicting reactions across the state have exposed deep divisions among local officials in the face of this great state green experiment.
It's a "cultural barrier" for district attorneys, said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana possession defendants and a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will comply.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana sellers and patients who use it that have attracted attention, the federal government has mostly kept medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states operating.
While drug agents probably won't break down doors to grab a small bag of drugs, they're likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana stores allowed under new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to advance.
Even before Election Day, some local governments had approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, though it will be about a year before any store can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose proposed a six-month ban and is likely to go into effect next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we give someone a license and then we make it a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We look at what the municipality voted for versus what the state voted for.
There are really many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a Conservative."
It's not just today's university students who are being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world's largest seat of knowledge, a modern wrapped Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Meanwhile, in the late 80s of the twentieth century, within two weeks of entering Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and plunged into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had given up because I objected to the students making love in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson cheerfully declared that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm bringing it up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of right-of-center students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of them demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Younger Generation Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and told they are not welcome because of their political views."
They call for the creation of a position on the university's equal opportunities committee to ensure that they can freely express their views.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC Two documentary about student politics, which portrayed conservatives as weirdos and neo-Nazis.
The programme featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and wore a silver-headed cane.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are being treated as "scapegoats" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Twenty-one-year-old Corpus Christi history student Samuel Roberts, who is behind the More Protection Movement, says the climate is "uncomfortable," while nineteen-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in JCR members' attitude toward right-of-center people.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and crippling shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was most feverish.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deny the award of an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would make even the Stalinists tremble with fear.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when the new students socialize with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of wormwood that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors tacitly approve of the teasing of conservative students, but they also enjoy participating in it.
A policy of miners' strike, privatisation and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was brought into the wood-panelled lecture halls.
My first lecture was about translating an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
It was pretty tough for me.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like cake dough, was very bile-like.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
Tears welled up in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt growled.
Devastated, I returned to my room.
I was sitting alone at dinner at school when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.
It was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, this is so.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even worse for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who (ironically) attended Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to change into Labour and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years unfolded before me as purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based on my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost not there.
He hated the place for its parochialism and pettiness, and for its adherence to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge with my disinterested metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends always had perfect manners.
His moist eyes grimaced.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a Conservative Party supporter, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week, during class, when another history professor declared in all seriousness that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing with shame inside, I admitted that "my parents had brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
The relief was short-lived.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was driven by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a smirking weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poison in an educational institution.
Even more tragically, it was Oxford that not only produced 14 Conservative prime ministers, but which to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation as a place of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which presents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his revered clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is brimming with private correspondence and photographs signed by prominent nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghero in northern Italy to an idol of the international "bohemian elite".
There is nothing wrong with liking royal families.
"At least they don't put a cigarette butt in a great carpet like some wonderful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And he's still a star."
Valeria Mazza performs Valentino
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentinian model Valeria Mazza.
"It's been many years since we went to his place for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, in the décor, in the food, in the music, in everything his spirit was reflected and felt.
It made everyone you invited feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who started working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Parade of Nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly reciprocated loves.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been converted into a distinctive seventy-meter-long arcade that offers a role swap: the visitor transforms into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "audience" of dreams wearing Valentino's masterpieces such as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Night",  or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In the audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "he cannot be forgotten".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, a shirt, a Gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity and great love for women because he underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten a lot and give a 'sparkle' to the face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore Valentino.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally lived to see the late 90s.
"I bought my first Valentine dress for a celebration in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with ruffles, a ruffled bodice, and a strapless top.
It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... Because a dress isn't just a dress, it's also a set of memories they have."
The "king" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
To create this ivory-colored silk dress with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a siding four and a half meters long, it took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority in the specialized press, this dress represents a landmark of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-être", Valentino is now his best example.
As Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest decoration in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded the Légion d'honneur, Garavani amasses as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
"I have always been drawn to his refinement, calmness, neat and perfect appearance," admits the Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
He was impeccable, time didn't leave a mark on him."
When the princess says it...
The toughest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the area of the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, porters in the Indonesian volcano area gamble with their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
Such is the case of Ant Wijayi, one of 400 miners who earn their living extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, it has to go to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and go into a solid state upon contact with air.
After cutting large blocks of sulphur, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, but it takes over 40 minutes for exhausted porters to climb up at turtle pace, as they keep their balance and carefully consider their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they are at the top, they make their way past tourists, who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to a vase that the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
It takes him three hours to make one trip and he is devastated at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (€11.5) per day.
While this seems like a negligible sum for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wages of miners here are very high. For example, collecting coffee costs 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as compelling as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java,  to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughs all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughs all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll be working for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than decent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man with fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, and instead does a porter job.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up at two o'clock in the morning every day, because the sulphur does not stop rising at night and its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and glows through the darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto climbs into the crater and lights his way with a small torch attached to his helmet and bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry baskets of sulfur from the crater floor on their shoulders
Although the company has high incomes, it has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, nor does it provide any equipment to porters working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they don't even get a share of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) of the photography surcharge that, along with a 15,000 rupee (€1.2) ticket, is collected by nature rangers from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, not for people," said Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has worked in Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can work "as long as he can" because he needs money for the education of his three sons, between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the thick fumes that emanate from the volcano, the miners are so hard that none of them complain of suffering from serious illnesses... However, this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are then transported by three trucks along a steep path between thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide, which is missing several teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, thirty, also earns his living by mining sulphur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation - crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame not having children on careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am married and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot. Let us fulfill our civic duty and beget new life!
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of an advertisement for menthol candies, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lines are part of a rap that uses local insinuations like "let's put the bun in the oven" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that created the video, hopes to use this ad to draw attention to the problem in a humorous way.
The agency's artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill "their civic duty."
"It's all an internet thing, so it must have been fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, like spread perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
One who doesn't take this too lightly is the Singapore government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's fertility rate with respect to population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the fertility rate exceeded 2, which is considered the recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department at the National Bureau of Population, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"It gives people a wider range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbreeding. The result is a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there were attempts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure to counter population decline, this caused resentment among the local population.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year recorded its worst election result since independence began.
After the elections, there was an effort to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has had known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending, and immigration policies, Singapore has also had some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Urban Development Authority has begun regulating the number of small apartments known as "shoeboxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in marketability.
However, there is concern that these apartments may encourage a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large single-family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of development firm EL Developers, says their "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
"They are more popular in that they sell days or weeks faster than houses with a larger area.
Therefore, they are much better for our cash flow."
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers, who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although the new rules could be aimed at boosting the nation's birth rate, interviews with Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district suggest they won't have much effect.
"People are always stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, so many people put it off," says the young official.
"Let the others have children.
But for me it's important to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old.
Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force people to have children, it is ultimately the Singaporeans who have the final say on starting a family.
What's private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to the vocabulary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any interference".
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in his normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15, who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered privacy to be "something entirely of one's own" on a personal level, and a "username and password" when it came to social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my biggest secrets," says ten-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she said.
"On FB I put nice photos or photos of us playing.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that made someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, nude photos or photographs of crimes, or to write demeaning or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there," he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or communicate quickly with friends," he says.
He says without hesitation that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of fourteen-year-old José is different.
The teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits he doesn't know 20 people on his friends list for the latter.
"I'm not worried about it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, none of them instructed him to do anything, nor did they ask him for an address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or require me to, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
The victim did not log out of the account, according to José.
"She just activated private mode."
He then explains a series of steps on how to set up your account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order to navigate social networks, children and adolescents need to understand that the main goal of social networks is to inform.
He states that: "The Internet originated as a means of finding information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate student in education at Yale University and author of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born in the age of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are just learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - sober, at a time when what they most want is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show children and teens what privacy is is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or: Would you like it if someone posted a picture of you the way you posted your friend's?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag people in party photos, have you asked their permission?
And one more thing: Does everyone always need to know what you're doing?
Another point is for them to realize that they have to behave in the same way in the Internet environment as they do outside it.
They are the same rules.
"Outside of the internet, one is guided by respect, morality and other principles, and it should be the same on social media," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, explains that it is essential for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every tricky thing, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences of opening an account on the Internet.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or post," he says.
Guardia believes it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
The South American summit ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the Lima Declaration, which was announced and reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Unasur's heads of state and government, but representatives of both the Foreign Ministry and the President's Office, who initially stipulated that they would publish the document after the summit, said it would later be published on the Peruvian government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had restricted access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential rally without sound was broadcast in the press room with the message "confidential session, audio transmission blocked".
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the spokespersons of some governments who were present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which provoked outrage from hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who demanded more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is only President Humala's statement and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion the Lima Declaration originally promised was not published, despite being eagerly demanded by the press.
On the official ASPA website, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were broadcast, but completely shut down the flow of information.
The summit ended with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept the Hague Court of Justice ruling on the border dispute between the two countries.
Peru's President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the dispute opened by Lima against Santiago on Monday by hearing a defense speech from both sides.
"We will comply and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are hearing today in this international court," President Humala said alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions and international courts," Piñera added, greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would comply with the ruling of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, a decision that Colombia considered completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and closing the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and work had been planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended."
He informed that actions are being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap Internet in all corners of South America, and to take joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation [of Latin America] should not have a winning essence, but serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between different places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a speech read.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concern better connections with Ecuador, but did not give further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return her to the Union of South American Nations", from which she is currently expelled.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the judgment of the International Court of Justice concerning the maritime boundary dispute, which is disputed by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are ruled out, not even a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with that country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the margins of the summit, EU defence ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that creating a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, really, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told state broadcaster TV Perú that Europeans "killed themselves in World War 2" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create South American citizenship, which is supported by Unasur member countries.
"There is a need for the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which is already taking place between the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that want to take us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president has said, among other things, that he agrees with the regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights are taken into account.
"Those in the lead never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States," he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision, as it did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at the time, "there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Assange might be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing trial."
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judiciary for asking him to submit to questioning on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Sweden's own legislation allows for questioning by video conference call, which could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"However, there is a risk that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate because he is confined in a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution of the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London under a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, stressing that talks had taken place with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there were constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings before various European instances," he said.
He said that "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, everything will be over".
And if Sweden listens to Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without any problem and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be put to an end tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of the situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, making it clear that he certainly does not tolerate "mediocrity, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of a free press are not us, mean and perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy that neither such journalists, nor "the bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie dominate Ecuador," and said that if re-elected, "he will continue to make changes in the right direction and direction."
President Correa also backed the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto on Unasur membership at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupism cloaked in legality" because it has in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said that he considered "entirely appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the aftermath of the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is currently not accepted.
"This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be considered broadly so that they can be overcome and be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute before Peru and Chile in the same court, expressing the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit to accept a judgment, however harsh it may be."
Referring to the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he sees the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said he would retire from public life if he lost the February 2013 election.
"Personally, I have never been interested in power, but such unjust situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last term as president and then I would retire from politics.
If we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new medical treatment in Cuba.
"I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chavez has left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president," he explained.
The head of state of Ecuador today attended the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if I had been struck by lightning," he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor tried to "soften a little" but apparently to no avail.
The boy kept it a secret from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own shoulders and began to inform himself about it. And with such enthusiasm that he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients of the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 90s when there were a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused destruction of the body and exhausted the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the appearance of AIDS in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "it means a great achievement that the life expectancy of a patient who starts treatment early and appropriately is exactly the same as in healthy people", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital, adding that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist, explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, with those who do not use drugs better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells can live up to 50 years.
Put simply, this means that someone diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can "live smoothly until the age of 75 if they follow treatment," the doctor explained in an interview.
To underline this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS Yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far as May this year. However, universal access to antiretroviral medicines has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die from the disease?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have not exhausted our stocks of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the state of infection, that is, at a late stage of the disease."
He adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection occurs. The only thing that needs to be done to have a greater influence on overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore we need to offer disease detection tests on a large scale to all those who request them."
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco, as well as with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests done in a private laboratory just because a friend did it, and despite his young age, he had already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma.  cancer, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go on a rampage three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthily, exercise, take medication."
To this day, all his parents know is that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the invitation to share his experience with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today, on World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they took a risk, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, it's better. And if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like everyone else if they're responsible."
This message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who researches HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "there has really been an increase in the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, now they give us packets of hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and medical staff that teens want to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this inefficient distribution. Let the condoms not only be behind the counters, but the hundred should be in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
Nor is it about "paying them beer and a motel," as Gov. Emilio González responded when asked if he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There is no such sexuality. It's best to make condoms available to those who already have sex lives," he said.
Key figures in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
This ranks fourth in new and identified AIDS cases and 13th in HIV-related cases in Mexico.
92% of infections occur sexually, 6% through the blood route and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people per registered case who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise Grupo Vitro's debt restructuring provided for by the bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an ominous precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighbouring country and solvency problems.
Thus, the corporate restructuring procedures allowed by Mexican law do not seem to apply in the land of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
The approval of a ruling handed down on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Hal at the North Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican companies without defense against the possibility of confiscation of their assets on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's main glass maker to appeal three irregularities.
At the outset, while the judge in this case argues that creditors should abide by U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth District Court of Appeals based in New Orleans says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would show ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, designating the American Law Institute as the arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without a vote by the branches from the internal corporate structure, recognising the indebtedness of the parent company Vitro to the subsidiaries, the required majority for approval of the restructuring would not have been reached.
However, Mexican law allows for this possibility.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
Moreover, it is true that, even after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors - who were against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. 'vulture funds' such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have reached a majority.
They would get about 45 percent to 37 percent in the vote.
This information is disregarded by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of the serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, González Sada's family business will file an appeal for reconsideration directly with the Court of Appeal, so that the review will take place with full participation, that is, with the participation of five judges, since only three originally voted.
If he does not succeed here, he will seek as a remedy a review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
What is significant about the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae department detailing Vitro's conduct under the Bankruptcy Act and pointing out that the company had made a concession by adhering to agreements signed by both countries in order to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for both Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
A criminal complaint by Mexican aviation unions against the company's former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraud, had been lying on the table for several months, and according to the pilots' union, the vessel had already overflowed.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing it of obstructing justice.
In its view, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic on a transaction carried out by that entrepreneur in which he withdrew 198 million pesos from IXE Bank from fideicommissum F/589 on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The funds were most likely directed towards buying shares in the Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is well known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens gathered at the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend and approved the creation of an association to prevent the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Kankun.
We are talking, as is known, about a huge trade and distribution center with products from the "country with a big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which at the bottom would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
Earlier, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose the monumental area, which would partially devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of the ACTA affair
The Senate's request, which the government ignored and which demanded clarification on the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, in Japan, has lost its relevance, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As is well known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, the development company Homex is marketing investment certificates worth 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet has created a consortium with the trade name Competival, which will target the software services market in Central and South America.
Investment in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of local basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a BSN player in the national basketball league, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón National Basketball League, and president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation.
"I've held many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN National League, general manager of the national team and chairman of the federation in the '90s," Reyes recalled while visiting reporters from the newspaper Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his statement.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all, he guards those that commemorate his time at Los Vaqueros from the mid-50s, where he was a player, until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"Those were my best years, I enjoyed them the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
That's when 'Cuco' Ortiz took over the team and was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me, 'I've got a tall two-foot-tall player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended point guard Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brought Bayamón a championship victory, Gausse would contribute to another."
He enjoyed the championship, when Gausse played for the Vaqueros team, but only from a distance, because in 1988 he was already serving as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's position in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in an Olympic qualifying match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championships, where we finished fourth, but we should have had bronze if it hadn't been for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final faceoff," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup squad the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as is the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was pretty similar to the one that blew us bronze at the World Championships.
That team not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but there were also youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have had a perfect composition, but managed to win us a gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, replacing players sent off due to a skirmish in the Pan American Games at Mar de Plata, we won gold against all odds.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved as much as Piculín at this level.
Not to mention his time in the different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
This is very difficult.
We had a very good generation that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Of the young ones, I really like the work of Leo Arillo.
Which of your greatest achievements in the Federation do you consider to be?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you fail to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as dividing the youth categories by region.
For example, that the boys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I am pleased about that.
What are you doing now?
I mostly listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted ruthlessly and was malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 80s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of Dallas, died Friday afternoon from complications related to cancer, according to an official announcement from the family provided to the Associated Press by Dallas' production company, Warner Bros.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas to once again play the iconic role he loved most," his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who played his wife in both the original and new seasons, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital," her agent, Jeffrey Lane, said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before Dallas aired, Hagman made a name for himself on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (genie), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to his home to live together.
He was also a star in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film appearances included critically acclaimed roles such as The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that brought him to the top of the stars.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and others around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Djejar?" intended to raise expectations for an emotional episode in which Hangman's character is nearly murdered has caused not only a huge amount of speculation from viewers around the world, but also millions of dollars risked at bookmakers.
This also helped the episode to set an audience record.
The November 1980 episode in which the answer was revealed was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most-watched entertainment show in history after the end of MASH in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot at by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin became pregnant with J.R., who threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a wily businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in a rehab facility.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Filming of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth is in the process of being filmed," the TV station reported.
In the immediate aftermath of Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT on how the series would proceed.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early '50s, Larry tried his luck on theater stages in New York and then served in England in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt or harm anyone," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began promoting organ donation and volunteered at a hospital helping fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they go for surgery and afterwards," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it will be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you will be healthy".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
A course that explores the "end of the world" begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long count" Mayan calendar, due on December 21, was seized upon by many as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap some call "debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict in which Israel is embroiled, the place where Christians theorizing about the end of the world say the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today as if we have 30 days left, it is a really good time.
And remember that bad means good to apocalyptic-minded people.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on "the end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Vacker runs a course on "The Means, Culture, and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas expand over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students are analyzing movies with apocalyptic themes and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what was possible, likely, believable and impossible," Vacker says.
On Pennsylvania State University's main campus, Latin history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to run a course simply titled The End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' because we always count on the possibility of holding the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "impending destruction", students have to study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched out to two hours," Restall said of his course for 35 high-average students.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mail inquiries asking if there was still space.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, 23, a religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is only a matter of consolation or the absence thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he's seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class where it could be taught before," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no student interviewed, let alone a professor, said they believed in an end date of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prediction and we're refuting it in a way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, by which people respond to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused this speculation to flourish.
"Elsewhere, people don't think about it," he said.
This happens overwhelmingly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is lecturing in the Philippines this year, was quick to answer when asked if he knew of a course on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception to the highest office.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will cease to exist.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors alike.
Several said they intended to go to the "end of the world" festivities.
"I'll probably call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a twenty-year-old communications student.
