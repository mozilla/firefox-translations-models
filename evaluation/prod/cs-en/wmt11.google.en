What will he do? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or a confectionery
The new city councilors from the ČSSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz &quot;tested&quot; the members of the new council from the ČSSD on how well they know the notoriously established slang that was created at the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which Prague&#39;s political elite introduced during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councilors do not understand well-known terms.
At least that&#39;s what he claims.
&quot;Who is Voldemort?&quot;
&quot;Really do not know.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m more of a newcomer to Prague politics,&quot; Lukáš Kaucký, councilor for culture, responded to the &quot;godfather&quot; vocabulary test.
And even though he is a political veteran, councilor Karel Březina reacted similarly.
For example, the term &quot;golf hole&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s the only expression you present to me that I occasionally use.&quot;
&quot;Otherwise, I don&#39;t recognize slang in general.&quot;
From the glossary, the expressions of which the daily Aktuálně.cz published this June before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously connected to the Prague municipality.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of &quot;Voldemort&quot;, &quot;the biggest golf hole in Prague&quot;, &quot;going to the candy shop&quot;, &quot;bull&#39;s neck&quot;, &quot;treason of the capital&quot; and &quot;plating&quot;.
A trio of councilors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head the Prague education system in the future - first promised an interview, but later stopped answering the phone.
Fifth councilor Petr Dolínek refused the test straight away.
&quot;I don&#39;t deal with these things at all, and I won&#39;t evaluate how the civil democrats are having fun.&quot;
&quot;I am now dealing with how we will understand each other within our programs,&quot; he responded.
As already stated, councilor Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the headline above that he was talking about an influential businessman and friend of the Bém expressor, Roman Janoušek.
&quot;Voldemort&quot; doesn&#39;t say anything to Kaucká and the only term he guessed correctly in the test is &quot;the biggest golf hole in Prague&quot;.
&quot;That&#39;s the Blanka tunnel,&quot; says Kaucký, and immediately adds: &quot;But I know it more from the newspapers.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll have to pay for some language course,&quot; he jokes.
Not only matador Karel Březina, but also councilor for the environment Lukáš Plachý deciphers the golf hole as Blanka&#39;s tunnel to the administration.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plaché is also familiar with where to find this figure - he guesses the meaning of the expression &quot;go to the candy store&quot;.
&quot;I think that means going to some company in Prague,&quot; Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušký companies.
Along with Březina, he recalls that he gained knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
According to test takers, there is no similar well-established dictionary of slang expressions in social democracy.
&quot;I consulted with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don&#39;t have anything like that.&quot;
&quot;We call each other by our names, sometimes we use abbreviations and corruptions of names,&quot; says Petr Hulínský, the chairman of the Prague ČSSD, nicknamed Hulda by party members.
&quot;At school they called me Birch, but I don&#39;t know if my colleagues call me that too,&quot; Karel Březina admits to his own nickname.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tried the name and it works.
Councilor Weinert is Děda or, less friendly, Dědek for party members, representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to party sponsorship fraud before the elections, is nicknamed &quot;Igráček&quot; by some of his colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats allow in internal party speech.
It is said that Hulínský does not like to hear Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz also noted another nickname of this Prague chairman.
&quot;Doctor of baton law&quot; is said to remind that Petr Hulínský received his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of &quot;witches&quot;, published a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso tend to have several characteristics in common.
They tend to belong to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example due to health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
The one who &quot;becomes&quot; a witch is sent into isolation so that she does not threaten the rest of the village.
&quot;It is very rare for a man to meet this fate.&quot;
&quot;Not even young, healthy women are left behind, because they help with work and give birth to children,&quot; describes a nun who takes care of more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their community in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual &quot;social measure&quot;.
She has published an information booklet that should help reduce the witch hunt.
But there is a catch.
&quot;More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,&quot; pointed out the disadvantage of written education, Die Standard newspaper.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after being tortured, doused with kerosene and set on fire by three women and two men.
The BBC reported on the case.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, oil, which is used for ritual anointing, caught fire on the woman.
It allegedly caught fire after the group wanted to &quot;exorcise an evil spirit&quot; from the woman.
The isolation of &quot;witches&quot; is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: &quot;Soul-eaters have always been a danger,&quot; he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, in The Gambia the president himself took part in it as recently as last year.
&quot;After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammi launched a large-scale hunt for witches who were allegedly involved in her death and tried to use black magic to kill the president himself.&quot;
&quot;He enlisted the help of shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president&#39;s bodyguards, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president&#39;s farm in Kanilai,&quot; Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bakal&#39;s tenant: He&#39;s drowning in the stove, he signed a higher rent
An older, stocky man stepped out of the door of the client center of the RPG Byty company of &quot;coal baron&quot; Zdenek Bakaly, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, he carried a folder with new leases for three apartments: his, his daughter&#39;s, and his son, who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation just raised the rent for all three.
Instead of 3,500 per month, the son will pay 4,100 crowns for a second-category 2+1 apartment from next year.
&quot;And there&#39;s no hot water there, and it has to be heated with a petrama (solid fuel stove, editor&#39;s note),&quot; the man points his finger at his son&#39;s new contract, which he has full power to sign.
&quot;But I signed it,&quot; he explains, half annoyed and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as &quot;incorrect and immoral,&quot; advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waves his hand over it.
&quot;One says this, the other that,&quot; he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rents in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the &quot;laboratory&quot; in person.
The Havířovská RPG waiting room is one of a total of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency with a calling device.
&quot;Rent 2011&quot;, a special button lights up on his touch screen.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You don&#39;t even have time to read &quot;157&quot; and your number is already beeping on the large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
It&#39;s your turn in half a second.
After a while, an older married couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room is apparently not related to the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
In Ostrava, the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving letters with new leases in their mailboxes since around mid-November.
In letters, RPG Byty proposes to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the client center on November 18.
&quot;It&#39;s been running for a week, so it&#39;s just getting started,&quot; the worker behind the counter answers after a moment&#39;s hesitation when the client introduces herself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal&#39;s former mining flats are a hot topic locally.
Before the elections, the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD took it up quite loudly, and even now the local newspapers are full of it.
&quot;Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.&quot;
&quot;They didn&#39;t even change the damn plate in my toilet,&quot; the man mentioned in the introduction is relieved.
So far, according to the workers, pensioners come the most to see if they will get a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as RPG promises them in the special offer.
Other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15 will also receive a half discount on the February rent.
However, the Havířov &quot;deregulation&quot; desk is definitely not overwhelmed with questions.
&quot;Out of yesterday&#39;s 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here because of the rent for 2011,&quot; estimates the worker behind the counter.
At the same time, RPG proposes individual negotiation of contracts on the website and on its bulletin boards where necessary.
However, if the two parties cannot agree on the rent, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
&quot;This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure,&quot; RPG warns on its website.
&quot;Nobody will be judged here,&quot; thinks one of the employees of RPG Byta, and the man on the street in front of the client center agrees with her partially.
&quot;I have a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food, I don&#39;t have to judge myself,&quot; he claims.
However, the employee soon becomes unsettled.
&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Zaorálek is telling them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting,&quot; he thinks.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011, and according to RPG Byta, their increase is an economic necessity.
&quot;The current rent still does not even reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock,&quot; reminds Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that the neglect of the housing stock, blamed by the angry tenant, is the main reason for the rent increase, according to the house owners.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPGs could invest four billion in apartments from rents, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The large-screen screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats several pieces of information highlighted in red.
&quot;The 2011 rent increase of 15% and less affects 31,200 apartments, that&#39;s more than 90% of RPG apartments.&quot;
&quot;And it will always be at most CZK 7.50 per square meter per month,&quot; appears on the screen.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent will rise by 38 percent.
&quot;In these cases, it is an increase from the extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter,&quot; warns RPG.
The rent for 2,600 apartments will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive out rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, he adds another commitment: the company will put all the money from the rent increase (see graph) back into the apartments, mainly into heat savings - new windows and insulation.
People who sign an agreement on rent increases are supposed to get them first.
The offices also include a kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect that it also houses a mini-nursery with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, loads of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design employees have been able to visit it.
The design-architecture company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings emerged, counted on space for its company mini-kindergarten from the very first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly of baby boomer age, and it was important to her that women designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Together with the possibility of part-time work, the nursery school is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of the social program.
Female builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with childcare.
The mini-school was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves, and with the support of the management, they managed to get a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed from the resources of the European Social Fund through the Human Resources and Employment Operational Program and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy in the amount of 2.8 million CZK), they were able to purchase equipment and facilities and provide qualified staff and operations for a period of two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-school at its own expense for a period of 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year, and the company Economy Rating significantly helped with the application for a subsidy.
Care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children around the clock, therefore children of any age can attend the nursery school, although most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a &quot;mini-school&quot;, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more may take turns during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents, and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten, regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is about individual education and care, the content of the program in the mini-school is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, they are also provided with quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school desks, the English language is also taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and stimulating games, but also with a computer that the children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time, and stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from nurseries far from the parents&#39; workplace are eliminated.
In this way, parents use working time more productively.
It is not surprising that a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship is created here.
Arch.Design has thus joined the ranks of Czech companies that offer a significant benefit when recruiting new employees, are family-friendly, and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house made of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudí&#39;s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
Such is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, a scale-like facade and ubiquitous soft curves are all typical of Antoni Gaudí&#39;s art nouveau style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
Upon close observation, one can see geometricity, rhythm and a well-thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is lit up in such a way that the impression of the brilliance of the colors is enhanced even more.
The winding and twisting of shapes appears equally in interiors.
Wood in waves replicates window frames, railings, decorative door elements, peepholes and moldings.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old structure and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí&#39;s idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló apartment building alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated with him.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started Jujola&#39;s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí&#39;s Casa Milá and Park Güell, which contains other works by Gaudí.
Due to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname &quot;House of Bones&quot; from the locals soon after its completion.
Others began to call it the &quot;yawning house&quot; because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows.
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted on the top of the building.
Other sculptural elements of the building also contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house with air vents and typical chimneys.
Their forty-five degree inclination may seem bizarre.
During his work, Gaudí absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city council was horrified by the result and asked for correction.
The councilors were bothered, for example, by the fact that the building&#39;s pillars encroached on the public sidewalk.
The rectification never took place, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the municipality&#39;s call, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social lounge, and on the third floor there were bedrooms and private parts of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is crossed by a staircase that can be used to climb up to the roof terrace itself.
The fundamental elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social area can be completely connected by opening the salon door, and a larger group can comfortably communicate with each other without at the same time maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to a new facade, the house with Gaudí&#39;s reconstruction also received an unconventional roof and two extra floors.
Gaudí&#39;s play with light is also impressive, with the blue and white glazed tiles lining the inner courtyard and the skylights.
The play of two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the sun&#39;s rays.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the building, the most spacious and luxurious apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided on this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed with the tours because they found it to be a very profitable business and in addition they expanded the tours to include common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
The entrance fee to the monument is certainly not negligible, it is 16.50 euros, and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a twenty percent discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you must quickly make friends with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit them directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and bed frame: women have different requirements than men
Not the luxurious bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface, i.e. the mattress and the slats, provide the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must complement each other harmoniously to suit the specific user.
When choosing, many things decide, from weight, height, age, state of health and gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and bed frame are made is also important.
A typical example?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages where there is no regular heating, because they &quot;heat up&quot; more slowly.
In addition, they tend to have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
At the same time, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
If they do not have a lot of ventilation channels in the core, and they are still lying on a solid board, they retain moisture: Mold could also appear under them.
Custom also determines the choice.
Anyone who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel comfortable on a low bed with a hard surface.
&quot;Perhaps all hockey players returning from the NHL complained to me that they couldn&#39;t sleep here.&quot;
&quot;They needed mattresses with a cushioning layer of lazy foam for their battered shoulders, heels and hips.&quot;
&quot;They are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they do not receive information from the joints and skin,&quot; explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, therefore searched for mattresses with lazy foam years ago.
&quot;Today it&#39;s fine, Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.&quot;
You don&#39;t have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy suds.
This &quot;miracle&quot; works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat, i.e. it adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pressures you, you won&#39;t roll over at night like after a hard match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing a mattress size, add the length of your foot to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of around 180 cm therefore need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and a possible visit.
&quot;Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should comfortably have your arms slightly bent at the elbows,&quot; advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, guild master of the Guild of Upholsterers and Decorators, who has been dedicated to the issue of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years and lectures on it at vocational schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own slat and mattress, but here, be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the slats at different heights, but you may not be able to do this for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring frame at least 15, of which count at least three centimeters for the shaping and expanding layer.
&quot;You must not feel the springs when touching your hands or sitting on the mattress,&quot; warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of slat.
Upholstered beds, where the mattress and base are like conjoined Siamese twins, have no business in bedrooms.
Mattresses do not ventilate well, their cover cannot be washed, which is common nowadays.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one big (and clogged) strainer.
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans about mattress lifespans of up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
However, everything has its downsides.
And that&#39;s why practical advice from sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, don&#39;t give up on hygiene and a removable cover, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with zippers all around, so that when unzipped you get two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), still the handling of the larger types (and with one person) could resemble a fight of lightweights when scanning in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a slat?
Never!
Maximum per bed intended for one-night visits.
However, still provide the board (if it does not already have them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it. Taschenfederkern) and an expanding layer.
A polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-positionable slatted slats with 14 to 18 slats, but you will always pay for slats with a larger number of slats, 28 or more, where the slats are doubled in the lumbar area and their rigidity is possible regulate.
Mattresses with a spring frame do not belong to positioning lamella grids, as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, you can also indulge in a so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper is nicely &quot;buried&quot;.
Definitely an important thing for men who have &quot;shoulders across the back&quot;.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers who have started to use a softening zone in the shoulder area in &quot;men&#39;s&quot; mattresses.
They also remember women - they treat them with a softer surface in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, wing or plate grates with so-called multi-torsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed to more points and the tension is reduced.
But beware, as soon as you use the wrong pillow (big and &quot;bloated&quot;) on the right mattress and bed frame, most of the &quot;plus&quot; will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
50 x 60 cm is recommended as a suitable size, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should equalize (together with the shoulder cradle of the grid or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
After all, modern mattresses have something in common with the original grass-filled straw bales.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is simply even for organic mattresses.
The raw materials from petroleum, from which polyurethane foams are made, are replaced by natural oils, for example from safflower and soybean.
Almost all well-known manufacturers use soy.
&quot;Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of material of purely natural origin,&quot; explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules to release the fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the birch plant extract &quot;cools&quot; men so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, the covers &quot;warm&quot; women.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today&#39;s favorites?
A mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cellular structure, so it is more breathable than regular polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
By combining different stiffnesses of cold foams and &quot;lazy&quot; foam, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heels should be.
For a quality mattress, you will pay from 7,000 crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters tend to have a lower VAT rate and are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage.
It is not easy to save money on a mattress and bed frame.
Sometimes you can take advantage of events from manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam sewn into the cover for 11,990 crowns.
However, the second one can already be purchased for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density was started at a &quot;cosmic&quot; pace by the Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, because astronauts were exposed to enormous overloads during launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, but hardens in the cold.
It thus perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of bedsores, but also for increasing comfort while sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example for special pillows under the feet, which relieve the legs and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want devices to monitor people, so they want to keep an eye on their children
Fear for their own child leads more and more people to the idea of monitoring via GPS.
The system originally created for searching for cars can also track the movement of people and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a matchbox, but soon it may be as big as a watch.
A number of people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
&quot;We are trying to tell everyone that it is not about spying, but about another means of reducing the probability that a tragedy will happen,&quot; says Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market.
&quot;I accept that in some cases such devices can be misused, for example if they are put in the bag of someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case.&quot;
&quot;Most of the time, customers actually buy it for security reasons,&quot; Pilin added.
According to him, a child should always know what purpose the &quot;box&quot; serves and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear something similar, they will simply get rid of it.
&quot;Even very young children show great creativity in deliberately losing things when they don&#39;t want to be in control.&quot;
&quot;Parents used to have high expectations for cell phones, which can be turned off just like these tracking devices,&quot; says Bočková.
According to her, it is questionable whether such a device would really help in the event of an attack.
&quot;When it comes to a planned abduction, the perpetrator will almost always make sure that the child does not have any electronics that could reveal their location.&quot;
“Now it&#39;s a phone.
&quot;When tracking devices start to proliferate, they will be looking for them too, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising.&quot;
&quot;In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,&quot; says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, its presence can help.
&quot;The device can be set to periodically send the location after a certain period of time.&quot;
&quot;If it were to be damaged, at least the person&#39;s last location would be available.&quot;
&quot;More expensive devices also have built-in inclinometers, so even if a person just slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately send a warning indicating the position,&quot; claims Čech.
According to him, smart mobile phones with navigation can also perform a similar service, where you only need to upload special software.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are either pendant-like devices the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, therefore, a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
&quot;This will have the greatest advantage in that a potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all.&quot;
&quot;Or he will only recognize them after some time and that can give the police extra time,&quot; he adds.
Whether tracking devices evolve into wristbands or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to monitor cars.
It is a combination of determining the location through the GPS system (which is used by common car navigation systems) and the function of a mobile phone, which reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would wrap around the Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords used to detonate explosives.
At the same time, the Ministry of Defense already delivered 224 kilometers of cords to warehouses last year.
The army thus has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two, maximum four years.
The army bought incendiary cords from the joint-stock company STV Group, as for 40 million crowns.
In justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of detonating cords, the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense wrote TODAY that the soldiers consume 60 kilometers of detonating cords per year during training.
However, it follows from the calculations of army pyrotechnicians that the MF TODAY contacted that all generals, army command officers, secretaries and cleaners would then have to go through very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Not excluding Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick.
This is the only way to justify the army&#39;s annual consumption of sixty kilometers of fuses.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if it really was, the army&#39;s supplies would last more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, it were true that for the basic training of every new professional, a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord is sufficient, as experts say, then the army secured - even with the increased consumption of engineering or special units - supplies for the mentioned 225 years with a fresh purchase.
At the same time, the soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondr that they have almost no ammunition for handguns, so shooting is also limited due to the lack of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t bother me either that they repeatedly buy such a large amount of fuses from us.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s their decision and they certainly know what they&#39;re going to do.&quot;
&quot;For us, the army is a good customer that we, as traders, try to satisfy,&quot; says Jan Děcký, STV Group&#39;s sales manager.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejšek, justifies the hundreds of kilometers of cord purchased by the fact that the army will have supplies of this &quot;ammunition&quot; for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group only talks about a four-year lifespan of a detonator, and police or army pyrotechnics only about two years.
&quot;With perfect storage, it could even be the four,&quot; says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish his name due to criticism of the army.
At the end of its useful life, each munition must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not threaten the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the ministry is the quantity discount for 445 kilometers of fire cords.
&quot;They cost us sixty percent less than last year&#39;s delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers,&quot; explains spokesman Pejšek, explaining the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of detonating cords by police pyrotechnicians, who dispose of ammunition from the Second World War or that of the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always only order enough to use up this ammunition before its useful life expires.
It worked for her due to the safety of pyrotechnicians, and she can also more flexibly acquire more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
Today, the Ministry of Defense is already having considerable difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for the campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians contacted by MF DNES, the same problem awaits the Czech one in a few years: it will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses, which it buys &quot;cheaply&quot; today.
I still draw on the contacts I gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in selling the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year&#39;s Entrepreneur of the Year competition was a 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
He bought a half-demolished house with five apartments from his savings from foreign jobs and with the help of a bank loan.
Considering that he was still a third-year university student at the time, that was a lot of courage.
&quot;At the time, the ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation here did not allow me not to try to do something about it,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting out the first renovated apartment to foreign workers.
He invested all the profit back into the house, which he gradually converted into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year, another one of the same quality was added to it.
&quot;We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchising concept, and other people interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise are applying,&quot; says last year&#39;s number one entrepreneur.
&quot;And the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition played a large part in this sale of the license to operate the hotel,&quot; adds Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater recognition and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
&quot;People recognized me on the streets, they often congratulated me additionally, and I must say that it was pleasant,&quot; he recalls.
He definitely recommends participation in the competition to everyone who is trying to do something.
It&#39;s not even necessary to win, any exposure is good.
He says that to this day, he draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not have gotten to otherwise.
“I started doing regular business with some I met through the competition.
According to him, the fame associated with success has affected every employee to a certain extent.
And that he has about seventy of them.
&quot;I see a greater loyalty and pride in them to be involved in something that has gained universal recognition.&quot;
&quot;This is far from just my personal achievement, it is the result of good work by all of us together.&quot;
&quot;Only my name is pushed to the fore,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the determination of the winner, however, Farmet has seen worse times behind it.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, won the prize for first place in last year&#39;s Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year in Slovanské dům.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts through which he built a small tool workshop in Česká Skalica into a company with a turnover of one hundred million.
&quot;I can say that the award encouraged not only me, but all my colleagues and increased our confidence to compete with the competition,&quot; says last year&#39;s winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet&#39;s history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karel Žďárský&#39;s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father founded a company for plastic bathtubs.
Not long after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the non-specialist public after its success in the competition through the media.
&quot;Not only our customers began to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
However, the past year in Farmet was not only a sign of euphoria from victories.
The award was based on the company&#39;s economic results up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And the year 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis peaked, which did not yet affect the citizens so much, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and began to limit purchases of new machines and technologies.
&quot;Of course, this situation did not escape us either.&quot;
&quot;Sales dropped by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were layoffs,&quot; explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit less than before the crisis.
However, what Farmet did not discount is the investment in research and development.
&quot;With the subsidies, we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international fairs, won major awards at domestic exhibitions,&quot; says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
&quot;I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that removes pointless regulations
The poll on Absurdity of the Year is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some pointless regulations have already been abolished.
The infamous winner of the next edition of the Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to bring documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
It was decided by more than a third of the less than four thousand voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper transcript, even though a clerk can obtain it with two clicks of a mouse.
Thanks to a poll, that will change.
&quot;The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the commercial register during checks on insurance premium payers,&quot; said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Administration.
The purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition is to shed light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and to cancel the meaningless ones.
This is the fourth time this year that it is part of the business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny, and it is increasingly popular among the public.
If last year about three thousand voters took part in the voting, this year there were already almost four thousand of them.
And it&#39;s no wonder, there are still plenty of various legal obligations that only serve to delay business.
&quot;Perhaps we are at the top of the world in terms of the number of tax returns,&quot; says Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, the simplification of business has become the declared goal of all governments.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and runs according to the same scenario every year.
Anyone can submit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition closes.
To register, use the web address www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the &quot;anti-price&quot; and let the public vote on it during October via the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and ordinances were entered into this year&#39;s survey.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the &quot;finalists&quot; of the competition, the nominees included, for example, the demand that cars for the maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year&#39;s seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening that is regularly attended by personalities from political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted in this culmination of the competition.
&quot;Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws sticks under the feet of entrepreneurs, that&#39;s why my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business,&quot; said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to abolish senseless regulations does not sound in vain.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the entrepreneur&#39;s obligation to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to take the stand to an exhibition or a pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report to the labor office for a foreign employee a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And until the third, all the best.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two step-on scales in their office.
This was eased this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator was abolished.
The new category honors socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
New in this year&#39;s fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competitions is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to support reasonable and fair business.
&quot;In this way, we want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities,&quot; says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition, as in the case of the rebel of the year competition.
This year&#39;s first year of this special sub-category of the main Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 competition was entered by companies for whom success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be worth a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities is diametrically different from one another, the common denominator of their efforts can be considered support and consideration.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, and in another, for example, personal problems or the health of one&#39;s own employees.
For example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports, was among the fourteen nationwide finalists.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to an endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
The paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of its disabled employees, takes care of its disabled employees, which is why it received the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the region in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionately reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for the fact that she preferentially buys from Czech manufacturers, supports civic activities in the immediate vicinity and saves the environment.
&quot;We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible,&quot; explains executive Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region cares about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
&quot;In addition, we support the People in Need foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community,&quot; says company representative Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, the activity of the Laundry and Cleaning Company from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to its employees&#39; pension insurance in the form of above-standard bonuses, is also worth mentioning.
&quot;Here, we give contributions for food, transport, qualification improvement and recreation,&quot; says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by August 15 at the latest were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category.
Incorrectly filled in or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
&quot;If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the &quot;main&quot; Vodafone Company of the Year competition.&quot;
&quot;Separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year competition,&quot; explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison &amp; Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police made an arrest during a public tender
The anti-corruption police made arrests in the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days.
The detectives put handcuffs on a local entrepreneur in the media sphere and real estate dealer Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition was won by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
&quot;So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offense of collusion in a public contract and a public tender,&quot; Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, told Práv, adding that no further details could be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
The 46-year-old businessman was released by the police after 24 hours.
Given the minimal amount of official information, one can only speculate about how he could have influenced the public competition.
When asked by Práva, the spokeswoman for the Land Fund, Lubomíra Černá, said that the police did indeed make arrests at the isolated workplace in Pilsen, during a public competition.
&quot;It was a client, not our employee,&quot; she specified.
According to Černá, the public competition has the correct name &quot;Call for submission of claims for the transfer of land according to the Land Act&quot; and is held in the event that several eligible applicants show interest in the offered land.
&quot;These persons, as part of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land.&quot;
&quot;According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims,&quot; explained the spokeswoman of the fund.
Apparently, Luboš G. had information about who applied for the call, and since he himself is also an authorized person, since he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the person interested in the land that he would not participate in the competition.
He probably collected severance pay for that.
That would explain why he had such a large sum of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He figured in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for the fact that he issued in lieu of restitution land on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access highway to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he very advantageously exchanged them with the municipality for a house in the very historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to act on it, because otherwise it would have endangered the construction by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds more per month for housing
Starting in January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewage, heat supplies, and rents will rise somewhere.
From January, families will have to take hundreds of crowns more out of their wallets than they do now.
Electricity will become more expensive by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in many places, central heating supplies will also become more expensive.
The increase in electricity prices should cost households in apartments hundreds of crowns more per year than they do now.
At the same time, the prices of power electricity have been reduced by all the main suppliers, so the significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas will be slightly more expensive, but at a time when people heat the most and thus have the highest consumption.
So they also have to count on hundreds of extra crowns every year.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive across the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January, families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns a year.
In turn, the residents of Prague are threatened with more than 9 percent more expensive water and sewage services, if the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Pražené will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the national comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the price of water and sewage is to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation ends in January, may increase significantly.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new rent amount intend to take the company to court.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300,000 apartments could rise by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whiskey stolen from the parents.
These are the drinks after which drunkards under the age of fifteen most often end up in the care of doctors.
Children are no exception, who are repeatedly treated in the hospital for epilepsy.
It follows from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the reception of children&#39;s departments of hospitals.
&quot;Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because they take a long time to get drunk.&quot;
&quot;The trend is definitely hard alcohol,&quot; Luděk Pelikán, head of the children&#39;s department of Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Práv.
&quot;When they manage to get a bottle for dad out of the cupboard, it&#39;s probably whiskey, but otherwise fernet and vodka prevail.&quot;
&quot;Vodka has the advantage that they pour it into juice and it doesn&#39;t smell so much,&quot; explained the primary.
And Eva Jurinová, the spokeswoman for the Motol University Hospital, agrees with him.
&quot;Most often it&#39;s fernet or rum.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools.&quot;
&quot;In some cases, it was slivovica that they brought from home,&quot; said Jurinová.
According to Principal Pelikán, 13- or 14-year-old drinkers on hospital admissions are a relatively common phenomenon.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motola, where ambulances bring over-excited schoolchildren from the wider area.
“One girl slept with us about four times.
&quot;She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with an additional 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in her blood combined with ecstasy,&quot; the doctor described a particularly serious case.
&quot;She was at the fairgrounds in Holešovice for some dance party.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s interesting that her mother didn&#39;t think it was strange at all that she didn&#39;t know about her daughter for 48 hours,&quot; the primary teacher marveled.
It is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for the drinking of their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of increasing child drinking.
However, according to experts, it is impossible to talk about addiction in the true sense of the word in children.
&quot;The term alcoholic means a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not the case with children.&quot;
&quot;Those who use alcohol repeatedly tend to have an unsuccessful family and social background,&quot; explained Primary Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, around forty drunken children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motola this year until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital are included in the statistics.
Child drunkards who are taken away by their parents after outpatient treatment, or taken home by the police, are not counted in any way.
Aside from when kids just sit down after school and drink a bottle of brandy, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal swings you can count on: Halloween, New Year&#39;s Eve and the end of the school year.
&quot;They either drink away the grief of a bad report card or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays.&quot;
&quot;Of course, at the witches&#39; reception, I also saw seven child drunkards at the same time,&quot; Pelikán pointed out.
A drunkard who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage compared to the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose will be banished by a watering infusion with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
&quot;They are actually better off, because they have a good awakening after the beautiful evening experience and they are not in pain.&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re just confused about where they are,&quot; Pelikán admitted, adding that he sometimes spoils the patients&#39; pleasant mood by at least listing the costs of their treatment.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization in an emergency bed can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
&quot;Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I directly calculated to the children during the visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer working part-time to earn money for that one party,&quot; added Pelikán.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not approach recourse proceedings in which the parents would recover the costs of treatment in cases of child drunkards.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, where the manufacturer of the Casa aircraft - EADS, is based on Tuesday.
It is the first time that machines of this type appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercises or demonstration flights.
These are two-seater versions of the L-159T1, which were previously operated by the Czech army and which were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159s.
They are still preserved in Aer Vodochody, and the trade intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek from the defense press department, it is not yet known when the planes will be physically dispatched from Vodochod.
&quot;Single-seater L-159 aircraft for the shift were allocated from long-term stored aircraft, without additional deposits and investments from the department of the Ministry.&quot;
&quot;The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state and form,&quot; Pejšek told Právu.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seater aircraft, because in May 2009 the ministry signed a contract worth 200 million crowns with Aer Vodochody to convert four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to introduce the aircraft into the armament of some alliance countries.
&quot;The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and they will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.&quot;
&quot;Therefore, it is up to the customer how he will implement this,&quot; said Pejšek.
Hospodářské noviny reported some time ago that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
Last year, the government of Mirek Topolánek approved the exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Defense did not call for a tender for the purchase and approached EADS directly.
The defense leadership at the time argued that the exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably also have a legal impact.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense in the European Court because it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by contacting one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague&#39;s Kbely airport within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than their ring finger are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That&#39;s the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
&quot;Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men under the age of 60,&quot; said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick&#39;s Institute of Cancer Research.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially when combined with genetic risk or other risk factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously more than three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to develop prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those whose index finger was longer than their ring finger, this risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men in their 60s the drop was even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone equals a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes the growth of prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knows about this study in passing, but he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer is &quot;completely proven&quot;.
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered in snow, the road crews drove all night in many places.
The D5 highway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents involving trucks and cars, and the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague is also closed.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed there at the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided at the 93rd kilometer, the accident resulted in injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 highway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should exit just outside Brno at kilometer 190 or drive through Brno and then enter Kývalka at kilometer 182.
Columns of several kilometers are formed there.
There is also an accident on the D11 highway, right on the way to Prague.
There is a few centimeter layer of snow in Prague, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are formed, for example, on Prosek, Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
The Prague crisis team is scheduled to meet again at eight in the morning.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven high-speed trains due to the snow.
For example, there are problems with the line from Prague to Kralupe or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11 o&#39;clock at night on Wednesday until five in the morning.
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
Three secondary roads are impassable in the Vyškovsk Region, tongues of snow form in places in the Brno Region, and snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in higher places in the Blanen Region.
Vyškovsko was one of the most affected places.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Cutters will need to be used to extend them.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be opened to traffic.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only maintained with inert sprinkles due to nature protection, there is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, ČTK reported.
From two to ten centimeters of snow fell in the Czech Republic, the most fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
About 15 centimeters of snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually stops.
US soldiers have a new &quot;smart weapon&quot;
The US Army deployed a new &quot;smart&quot; weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and &quot;change the game&quot; in their favour.
The new weapon is something like a small super-accurate cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm cartridges developed for this rifle and containing high-explosive explosives effectively function as small grenades.
The charges can be programmed to detonate not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
Because he is usually not protected from above, and when a murderous rain of steel shards descends on him, it can knock him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audette, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use &quot;smart&quot; technology.
&quot;Basically, the soldier handles it by finding a target, sending a laser beam at it to determine the distance, get a precise point of aim, adjust the aim accordingly and pull the trigger.&quot;
“Let&#39;s say you measured 543 meters.
&quot;When you pull the trigger, the gun loads and fires a round at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters,&quot; Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu concern will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace from the current administration building on Marienbader-platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park next July.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday, next July 400 men and women will move their workplaces from the existing administrative building on Marienbader-platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyonská street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the statement of Fujist&#39;s spokesperson, another 100 jobs of the concern, which are currently distributed in the region, should be moved there in the foreseeable future.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive, and the spacious offices in Astro Park are said to be more suitable for the employees&#39; way of working.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Competent CEO Bernd Wagner said, &quot;in Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure&quot;.
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important business within the region caused joy for the winners and disappointment for the losers yesterday.
Frankfurt&#39;s chief economic officer Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was possible to acquire a &quot;global player&quot;.
It is said to be a &quot;fantastic display of confidence in this location&quot;.
Fujitsu is said to be a good fit for the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu&#39;s decision.
It is said that the city was informed in time by the management of the company about his intention.
&quot;Of course we offered the company our help,&quot; said Korwisi.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the computer manufacturer&#39;s difficulties with the landlord of the property on Marienbader-náměstí.
In the end, economic reasons were decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
&quot;I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative.&quot;
Ten years ago, the house on the Rathaus square, which was used by Fujitsu until now, and the neighboring &quot;Kleine Vertikale&quot; were, together with the other buildings on the Marienbader square, one of the most discussed construction projects in the spa town.
Between the railway station and the town hall, the so-called city entrance was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer, which was criticized both because of the massive development of areas that previously served as parking lots and at the same time because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chansen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and were sold a year later to Spain&#39;s Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu concern from Tokyo describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers companies computers and servers at their disposal and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine-Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, but most Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building of Astro Park, 7,000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the star-shaped floor plan, which is twenty years old, the central union of the electrical and electronic industry is also located, among others.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is in trouble.
Amazon Internet Service has disabled the discovery platform on its servers.
It is possible that this was done under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, the whistleblowing platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list, is reportedly being held, according to a UK newspaper report.
&quot;Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon&#39;s server.&quot;
&quot;Free speech in the land of the free,&quot; the activists said in a posting on the short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon pulled the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle the high number of accesses to the documents when publishing secret diplomatic cables.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the move: &quot;Fine - now we&#39;re going to spend our dollars employing people in Europe.&quot;
When Amazon has such problems with free speech, &quot;then they should stop selling books&quot;.
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after it said associates of Sen. Joe Lieberman conducted an investigation, CNN reported, citing information from Lieberman&#39;s office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British &quot;Guardian&quot; reported.
&quot;I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step sooner, given the earlier releases of classified information on Wikileaks,&quot; the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
&quot;Wikileaks is acting illegally, brazenly and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life across the planet,&quot; one nonpartisan senator said in a statement.
&quot;No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in their efforts to disseminate stolen material.&quot;
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list.
Based on a report in the London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, a 39-year-old Australian is staying in Great Britain, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had also been threats.
&quot;There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange.&quot;
That&#39;s why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That&#39;s why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently reacting to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, called for the person responsible for the WikiLeaks disclosure to be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on TV - apparently ironically, Assange should be &quot;assassinated&quot; and Obama could use a &quot;target plane&quot;.
Meanwhile, a verbal firefight broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot; that Assange was calling for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for the recently published spy calls to diplomats.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of one person with a website,&quot; Gibbs said.
&quot;Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his website.&quot;
The US government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism, has been appointed as the special commissioner, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the &quot;necessary structural reforms&quot; required following the release of the embassy&#39;s reports on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government shares and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger due to disclosures on Wikileaks.
&quot;We have made every effort to get in touch with them,&quot; State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
&quot;We are ready to protect them if necessary.&quot;
Ice Cream University
At the &quot;Gelato University&quot; near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is very popular and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a little old-fashioned ice cream maker in Czech, makes cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling box with a spatula, wipes it into a wafer and sells it.
You don&#39;t need to go to Anzola dell&#39;Emilia in the province of Bologna to find this out.
But those who want to learn even more about ice cream cannot avoid the &quot;Gelato-University&quot; of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines established an ice cream university, so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere corresponds to the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is very popular and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and an internship in our own ice cream parlor.
Someone yearns for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture onto the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is decisive, but also silky smoothness and a good consistency.
Luciano won&#39;t forget the southern and patriotic icing on the cake during his training: &quot;Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there&#39;s a touch of romance.&quot;
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which heats everything up to 85 degrees using an electronic program and then immediately cools it down to four degrees.
Then he turns the faucet on the machine and the pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all types of milk ice cream, flows out.
The docent is immediately bombarded with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural ingredients without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment by oneself?
Luciano warns against letting yourself be carried away by the zeitgeist into the unknown.
Anyone who talks about ice cream &quot;from only natural ingredients&quot; probably used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will curdle and the customer will eat the ice grains themselves.
Certain variations of the base material are permitted.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano differentiates the taste of the ice cream according to the ingredients, which are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are powders and creams.
&quot;Suppliers will try to force a lot of flavoring ingredients on you.&quot;
&quot;But you should simply experiment.&quot;
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from a white base that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into a base for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now course participants are allowed to ice cream machines.
Luciano has them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - in terms of taste, it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn&#39;t have to taste nuttier when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture brings out the flavor of Gelato properly, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a device that determines the sugar content of fruit (winemakers use it to measure must from grapes).
Fortunately, spreadsheets make the numbers easy.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the device for the automatic production of the base material that helps.
There is also a device that mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream at the same time and cools it down to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we cannot avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a giant blender gets out of control.
&quot;In any course,&quot; believes Maestro Luciano, &quot;it&#39;s only a matter of time before something like this happens.&quot;
Auditors in double light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to the industry that experiments with genetic plants.
The allegation has now been made by a group of experts, Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
&quot;It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well&quot;, said Testbiotech head Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been contracted by the lobbyist union Ilsi for several years.
It is financed by concerns such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was decisively involved in Efsa&#39;s control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
Efsa&#39;s regulations are said to match in full paragraphs with the Ilsi documents and thus bear the signature of the industry, which should be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech draws attention to a conflict of interest.
Recently, a high-ranking manager from Efsa transferred without additions or a transition period to the Swiss agrarian concern Syngenta - thus switching sides.
Central German Radio (MDR) also recently revealed the personnel connection of the EU control authority with the industrial lobby, which aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU parliamentarians.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
We work with all serious data, including those from industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
Professionals working for Efsa are not required to have industry contacts.
But they have to document them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It bills itself as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things to assess the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt at feeding, and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
&quot;We want to know, for example, what the genetically modified corn will do in the field,&quot; says Then.
Current practice is to only test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
&quot;If risks are not looked for, then how would it be possible to find them?&quot;, asks Then plaintively.
Angelika Hilbeck also agrees with this.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the US, now also in Europe, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected to corporations.
Studies that are critical to companies are usually not published.
&quot;Industry controls safety research,&quot; Hilbeck believes.
A trail of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, about 400 kilograms in total.
On Monday evening, he stood outside the station in Stuttgart, tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is well known: In September, excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar reduction of the station.
When construction was halted, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft rough stone that was used between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured several of these pieces.
“These stones are relics.
“It must not disappear.
It dissolves: &quot;A cheap and poor stone, simple and primal.&quot;
When he cut one open, it reeked of cigarette smoke.
He doesn&#39;t know yet what he will do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former French army ammunition dump where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals in old stones.
He bought all of them that were created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
&quot;It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappeared into landfill,&quot; he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a guard house.
He says he was berated and threatened when it was all over the papers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he talked for days with the opponents of S-21.
And he explained to them that he was not responsible for the demolition at all.
And if it&#39;s already happening, then it&#39;s most reasonable if the stones continue to be used.
Then about 200 S-21-adversaries each took a block weighing about 80 kilograms, the price per piece from 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it during the rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, the load of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest was sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and hauled away what could fit in the trunk and on the trailer.
The stones of dispute from Stuttgart have long been transformed into &quot;walls&quot; or as the edges of herb beds.
&quot;This stone is actually nothing special,&quot; says Rongen.
&quot;If it wasn&#39;t for the political nipple.&quot;
He gets into his all-terrain vehicle and goes for a drive around his 20-hectare kingdom.
He first studied law, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And a lover of stones.
It has stored 40000 tons of stones.
They bundle their treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest dealer in old stones in the Republic.
Brakes.
Artistically worked sandstone lies in the snow.
&quot;They once belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden,&quot; he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
“My favorite stone.
We continue along the path up through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And further.
&quot;Nice travertine.&quot;
Those blocks once belonged to the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Stones and stories lie everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt travertine from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how stones used to be broken by hand and transported using simple hoists and bullock carts, he becomes completely reverent.
&quot;It would be a scandal if something like that was crushed.&quot;
He didn&#39;t become rich, not very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone dealer employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassblower and one gardener have settled up in the forest.
&quot;We work hard, but it&#39;s satisfying,&quot; says the one who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Cologne in the foreseeable future.
Stones will also be salvaged there.
The battle of talents for High-potentials
There are a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students huddle over sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of the VW company, they are here to talk about the car of the future - and just to get to know Volkswagen by the way.
Many companies try to succeed in the race for the smartest minds, just like the VW company, and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: To recruit the most talented graduates in the classrooms as soon as possible, before they reach the job market and others are interested in them.
As universities do not publish any success lists of their students, companies try to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and acquire them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive concern is trying to recruit talent the next day.
A young lady from the personnel department is handing out pens, gummy bears and plates with the VW logo.
He tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs and suggests ways to the concern.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig looks after the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both parties: &quot;Students get exposure to industry and gain experience.&quot;
&quot;VW can simultaneously get to know the students, get to know interesting candidates better and think about who would be suitable as a colleague.&quot;
Such cooperations, according to Sella, are not unusual.
But the novelty is that they are fighting so openly for students.
&quot;Otherwise it was more of a substantial professional project&quot;, says Selle.
The fight for recent graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from long pools of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract a particularly highly qualified workforce.
Above all, engineering graduates have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German Engineers VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will grow even more.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which the participants have to find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the USA next year.
At the same time, participants can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many applicants will fly to the US.
According to Dykta, increasingly tougher laws will apply in the fight for High Potentials at universities.
&quot;We want to stand out from the rest with our Race.&quot;
&quot;A simple sailing trip was too little for us.&quot;
Talent hunter Dykta seems to be in luck.
&quot;We have remained in contact with all participants of a similar event last year.&quot;
&quot;Some will be graduating soon and are planning to apply for a job with us,&quot; he says.
In addition to direct outreach on campus, mainly small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically on job markets.
&quot;We try to contact alumni at trade shows.&quot;
&quot;Like, for example, at Intersolar&quot;, says Sitha Stübe, head of the HR department of the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The company from Bonn employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions listed on the company&#39;s website.
&quot;Currently, it&#39;s just difficult to fill vacancies.&quot;
&quot;It costs a lot of time and money,&quot; he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
&quot;Professors inform us that it is possible to do an internship or write a diploma thesis here.&quot;
The solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to entice with other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
&quot;Large corporations often can&#39;t offer this,&quot; says head of personnel department Stübe.
For a long time, money does not play the main role when looking for a job.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other decisive factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and the working environment and monitors the general conditions of the employees.
Head of personnel department Stübe hopes the placement will earn her points with job seekers.
&quot;I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about external evaluations of a potential employer&quot;, he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer through a long-term strategy.
She advises her customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, this means primarily internal measures.
&quot;The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees&quot;, he says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. promoting the employer on the market within its own employees.
&quot;Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.&quot;
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, they will automatically advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
&quot;It&#39;s like a game of string,&quot; says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be built off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - thus canceling the earlier plans for good.
New wells are also prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil rig in April.
Before this disaster, which cost the lives of 11 workers and led to the worst environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Proponents are trying to reduce the US&#39;s dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
At the center of criticism is the British energy concern BP, which is confronted with billion requests.
The commission of inquiry appointed by Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil concerns submitted applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with stricter controls and strict safety regulations.
Currently, the control office, which drew attention to itself with many corruption accusations, is undergoing a fundamental reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas corporations.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will fundamentally reduce the volume of oil produced in the Gulf.
&quot;Government plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the gas and oil industry&quot;, reads the result of the current survey of the industry by the consulting firm BDO - even before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the industry: &quot;Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation.&quot;
Investments in new mining projects are postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoni area burnt down
The water in the rivers is brown with oil, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People make a living by stealing, corrupting and illegally boiling oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot;, the environmental activist reassures the journalists: &quot;Today you will still get a lot of oil mud in front of the lens.&quot;
A 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading through chest-deep water surrounded by streaks: the scene looks almost pretty in the iridescent sheen of the water.
The fact that the brown deposits of oil float beneath the surface cannot be seen.
Earlier, she used to collect enough shrimps for containers here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the river Bodo-Jetta.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge wetland from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo have to paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni region, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst infested areas in the world.
Along the river through mangrove swamps with a lot of side tributaries, the full extent of the trigger is only noticeable.
The engine on the boat boils brown mush instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out oily fingers.
Mangrove roots rise from the ground like black licorice sticks, rare palm trees let their leaves hang sadly.
We search in vain for the flocks of birds that are normally found in wet areas: As soon as the engine on the boat dies, an eerie silence descends on the former paradise, where it smells like a pump.
&quot;What is happening here is ecological warfare,&quot; Celestine Akpobari says sadly: &quot;We live in constant fear of health.&quot;
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe flocked here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell concern had to stop in 1993, its production because it was too dangerous for the employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while more than two million barrels of black gold are mined daily from the entire delta area three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipeline, the oil fields in the Ogoni area lie idle, for the concern it is the situation is very unstable.
Every few hundred meters, steel structures rise out of the water like bizarre sculptures: &quot;Christmas trees&quot;, that&#39;s how the borehole heads are called, all too tenderly.
They are 50 years old, most of them rusted to the core.
Every now and then, a wellhead like this breaks, Akpobari says, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts&#39; estimates, more than two billion liters have leaked into the ecosystem in the delta in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that leaked into the sea off Alaska during the accident of the supertanker &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Disputes abound as to who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists point to cracked wellheads and leaky pipelines as the main cause.
In 2008, US-American scientist Richard Steiner complained to the concern that Shell requires much smaller safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world: Only the number of failures on the lines is said to be &quot;several times higher than elsewhere&quot;.
In what from a distance looks like an abandoned, oil-stained open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: completely naked and up to their necks in oil.
A fire burns beneath one of the many barrels, partly connected by wires, partly randomly scattered across the ground: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the line into the catch pot, later kerosene drips at the end of the line, and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four associates produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: &quot;We earn 34,000 Naira&quot; - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of chronic fuel shortages in black Africa&#39;s biggest oil nation.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
Illegal producers can still beat the ridiculously low price of 40 euro cents per liter of diesel: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from &quot;bunkers&quot; that connect to pipelines everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are being lost to the country every day in the entire Niger Delta region.
But only a negligible part of the provisionally stored raw material is refined illegally: The largest share is filled by organized criminal networks, which are supposed to include politicians and high-ranking representatives of the army, into tankers and sold on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate whether the disaster was caused by the residents and their interventions or the lax way of production to be purely academic.
&quot;If the oil companies had not considered themselves intruders and if they had not so completely destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.&quot;
Meanwhile, Ogoni&#39;s relationship, especially with Shell, is so damaged that the only option is to leave the concern: &quot;Perhaps other nations like the Chinese will prove to be better.&quot;
Michael gets restless.
&quot;High time you disappeared&quot;, says the muscular producer.
“Soldiers could come at any moment.
If a special military unit found them, they would not face prison, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
&quot;This accursed thing has brought our land to the bottom in every way,&quot; says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction flaw in the A380&#39;s engines
The A380 apparently has a major security flaw.
Investigators found a possible construction defect that could have led to a &quot;catastrophic engine failure&quot; during an inspection of the crash-landed machine.
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers were apparently luckier than previously known when they made an emergency landing in early November: Australia&#39;s aviation safety authority has discovered a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s during its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction flaw.
A possible fault would have severe consequences: one oil connection could crack due to wear, the ATSB said in a statement released this Thursday.
This fact could lead to &quot;catastrophic engine failure&quot;.
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
An Australian airline has now taken legal action against a British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of claim in the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney, allowing for further legal action against the company.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts came loose and damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce attributed the damage to burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with the giant planes that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety advisory is the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security flaw was deemed important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas plane made an emergency landing, the airline grounded its A380 fleet for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept three of its eleven A380s on the ground temporarily.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The double-decker is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany all in white: it snowed overnight in almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on many roads, train and plane connections are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire republic was covered in snow on Thursday night in freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but could not handle the newly blown snow.
In addition, there was a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy surge in the morning on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein with water levels 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowdrifts have caused significant problems on motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to the bad weather center Meteomedia, the alert level in Saxon Switzerland was therefore at purple - the highest level ever.
In some areas, 30 centimeters of new snow fell, strong and fresh winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars were left there during the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major problems on the roads.
Wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion on the A2.
In Thuringia there were problems due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major problems are occurring in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or broken overhead lines and switches.
Long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
One ICE to Munich had to stop in Saalfeld in Thuringia.
165 passengers received woolen blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers on the train.
A snow wind blew across the roads.
Many flights were canceled at major German airports due to the snow winds.
According to the spokesperson of the Flight Information Center, canceled flights have already been reported from Munich.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have been canceled in Frankfurt am Main.
Road maintenance is a constant effort.
Although only a few passengers were left without a connection at the airport, 400 field beds have been prepared for them.
There were already accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, one lorry driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught at a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg therefore remained closed until the morning hours.
And on top of that, a 30-year-old woman died after her car overturned on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of a light powder, which is why it will rise even with light gusts of wind.
But the wind weakens.
Only near the Baltic Sea will there be fast gale-force winds.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for the twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: the bank is looking for a buyer for two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters, according to a newspaper report.
The property could fetch up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its corporate headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt&#39;s banking district have been modernized; meanwhile the bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial concern apparently wants the renovation costs back again - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as reported by the &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot; with reference to a spokesperson.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
&quot;We are still investigating whether it makes more sense to own the properties or sell them and then rent them out again,&quot; he said.
With this, the largest credit institute in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of its own fund and subsequently renovated them expensively.
According to data, the energy reconstruction swallowed around 200 million euros.
The sale would probably make the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper text, experts from the field estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed &quot;Greentowers&quot;, to be around 500 million euros.
A spokesman said it had not been decided whether the building would be sold back to the trust or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people paid tribute to the buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
The dead have still not been rescued, as the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, a powerful explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were crushed in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to the high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
Still failed to free the dead.
Now relatives and friends honored the memory of the dead.
Ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They were silent for two minutes.
To honor the memory of the buried miners, 29 tables were built, with helmets, lamps and the names of the miners on them.
Pictures and personal items such as clothes and surfboards also found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would once again emerge from &quot;the depths of the earth&quot; to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told those attending the memorial event.
“But they never came home.
He can&#39;t say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was crushed in the mine.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial event.
British and South African miners were also overwhelmed during the November 19 explosion.
Rescuers began by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand&#39;s South Island.
Once the poisonous gases dissolve, the high temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To Hell, Warriors!
Is horror suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to conquer old boundaries again with his fighting epic &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;.
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he made &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;?
A captured one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) breaks free from his tormentors and slaughters his opponents on a large scale with almost supernatural power - sounds perfect for young male viewers looking for gory action, as our hero helps himself and his enemies with cruel methods of killing he even rips the entrails alive from his stomach when he&#39;s in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eye, as he is actually called, does not say a word throughout the entire film and the other characters only utter one or two sentences or let themselves be dragged into agonizing dying screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and revel in the hauntingly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very calm camera shots.
It&#39;s good when a film has multiple target groups, it&#39;s just a shame when they&#39;re mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after making his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers &quot;Pusher&quot;, is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically resists bringing his works either more humor to the mainstream or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most fans of arthouse cinema will probably be put off by brains and guts splattered everywhere.
Fans of action movies will get bored at the latest when One-Eye, for reasons that are freely explained, takes a boat to Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries and remains hanging for an eternity in no wind and fog, before apparently sailing the team to America and remaining silent there.
So it&#39;s no wonder that in Germany &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; didn&#39;t make it to cinemas and has now only been released on DVD.
It&#39;s a shame mainly because of the wonderful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes covered in blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved some attention.
This movie is not about the dialogues or the exact plot, it&#39;s all about the atmosphere, a fever dream that became a movie.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn does not allow him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his chilling shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all the indescribable hatred that pours from the hearts of the characters.
Only the little blond boy who helps One-Eye retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by malice.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, who becomes a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil, over time to enemies and transient allies.
It represents destruction, but perhaps also only for the corrupted.
&quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; is a mystery film that can be hated and admired for anger, excitement and admiration.
Enjoyment.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new warnings about Syria&#39;s secret nuclear program.
But the country resists expression - and won&#39;t even allow inspections.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger town is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square tucked away in a valley that turns off the stream.
Based on a statement by the US-American foreign secret service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known by the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the fifties is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with out-of-focus satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction.
In addition, photographs were submitted that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before start-up, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than then, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in al-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that the country had an &quot;active nuclear weapons program&quot;.
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of the &quot;alleged reactor&quot;, although they consider the CIA&#39;s presentation &quot;credible&quot;.
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how he is sure that he has a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer that the IAEA has &quot;enough material to ask questions&quot;.
The rubble of the allegedly &quot;unused military building&quot; was quickly cleared away by the Syrians and they also properly leveled the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, the IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen managed to find traces of uranium that was produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received through the member state satellite photos of commercial vendors from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market because they were exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - possibly Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never had a secret nuclear program, nor was it building a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, he prohibited the auditors from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also stubbornly silent.
&quot;We will never comment on it&quot;, recently confirmed the official position of the ruling Prime Minister at the time, Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has thus dragged on without results since June 2008 and &quot;is growing into a serious problem with regard to the credibility of the authority&quot;, as a senior Western diplomat admitted at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, this is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA sees three other facilities that are supposed to be &quot;in functional connection&quot; with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist - as key to progressing the case.
At the same time, the auditors have not yet indicated which devices are concerned, nor what their function is or why they are suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings in satellite images that is likely one of the suspected objects.
It is apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason Syria refuses IAEA access to these three sites.
It was heard in Vienna that the Syrians are afraid of a so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence, as well as satellite images, that material was transported back and forth between these three sites and the Euphrates square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be &quot;related to fuel production&quot;.
But there is &quot;no evidence of sensitive activities&quot;, i.e. of uranium enrichment and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is fueled by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from, and where the plutonium for the bomb should be split from it later, there are only probable guesses on these central questions.
It is also not known whether debris that could hide important clues is preserved in these three locations.
As if hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to have any information as to where the debris went.
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable repository for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in one analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious Jane&#39;s Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn&#39;t help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA spent many months creating a plan for the auditors to allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much the auditors are interested.
Meanwhile, Damascus rejected this proposal as well.
If only a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was destroyed and that&#39;s why the thing is not burning, for several months US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspections, has already talked about &quot;the option I am leaning towards in the future&quot;, but he is still hesitant.
This choice presents a big risk: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA&#39;s Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, &quot;What happens if they end up finding nothing?&quot;
Love in a time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie began work on her as-yet-untitled directorial debut over the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but even that causes unease.
There is persistent talk that the woman, who is a Muslim, falls in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women&#39;s associations immediately protested, so the planned filming was hastily moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women&#39;s War Victims Organization wrote to Jolie through the UN refugee aid organization UNHCR and requested a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is also an ambassador for the UN refugee aid organization.
She&#39;s not exactly diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they declined.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie&#39;s attitude towards the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended the UN refugee agency to release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, allowed filming after some minor wrangling in Sarajevo - it&#39;s not entirely clear why Jolie still didn&#39;t come.
The young author emphasizes that she does not pursue any political intentions in her film, that she devoted a lot of effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains indeterminate.
Another version of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds really quite different: the lovers knew each other before the start of the war and meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than &quot;rape victim falls in love with her tormentor&quot;.
The fact that Jolie&#39;s film really begins before the war - is true.
Jolie objects that the pressure being put on her is &quot;not fair and based on incorrect information&quot;.
Now the hackers from Hollywood can free her: By illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
Tonight is another good one for the Irish.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates their guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy to the sound of loud music, stomp their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in Cork, South Ireland is buzzing as players throw tennis balls three meters into beer mugs - and hit each other.
&quot;Beer pong&quot; is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize, plus tickets to Las Vegas for the world beer pong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is the quiet type; this yelling beer game and a reserved computer scientist, they don&#39;t go well together.
Nevertheless, the 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to distract himself from the burdensome question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play passion in Las Vegas, he is going to interview in New Zealand in January.
&quot;I feel so weird about it,&quot; he says.
“It&#39;s so far away and I don&#39;t have a job there yet.
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - &quot;she immediately got her dream job as an Event Manager, maybe that&#39;s a good sign&quot;, says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of the three Tanner siblings already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The Boys Leave : As with the Tanners, this seems to be the case with many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the foreseeable future, predict experts from the scientific institute for economic and social affairs ESRI in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a wave of emigration similar to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to the Irish, now gloom is spreading again.
The economic crisis especially worries young, educated Irish people, who have only experienced an upswing so far.
Job loss and social relegation seemed absurd in those boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was plenty of money.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are unemployed.
There are many letters in the Irish Times from readers complaining: &quot;Everything is going downhill in Ireland.&quot;
&quot;There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, they go away and our country loses an entire generation.&quot;
&quot;Please let the last one go out.&quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students&#39; Union, sees a bleak future as the government is lying and offering young people no future.
&quot;They are reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,&quot; says the 20-year-old.
She watches as her classmates bounce from one unpaid intern to the next.
Her biggest worry is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject in a positive light.
McLarnon organizes &quot;WorkingAbroadExpo&quot;, an exhibition that offers a total service on the topic of working abroad.
&quot;For beginners on the labor market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder&quot;, says the manager.
His website features photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a chore, but freedom and joy.
Seán O&#39;Donovan has known for six months what it&#39;s like to build something somewhere else.
As the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
He is currently building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O&#39;Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home as he works extra shifts to pay off his home loan.
&quot;The situation is really a bit crazy sometimes,&quot; he says, as he steps into his own home for the first time in a long time.
&quot;I&#39;m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I&#39;m basically not in at all.&quot;
He laughs awkwardly and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, large expensive cars parked in the driveways.
O&#39;Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for €380,000 - 100 per cent financed by a loan.
&quot;It was a crazy time, easy money without many questions,&quot; he says.
Is he afraid that things might not go well with the loan?
O&#39;Donovan thinks for a moment, refills his hot tea and says, &quot;I have no children to support and I&#39;m young; even if things go wrong, I can start again.&quot;
The civil engineer doesn&#39;t like the whining he hears so often now.
&quot;No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island,&quot; he says.
&quot;Working abroad for a while isn&#39;t the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we&#39;ll feel more Irish.&quot;
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England during the last economic crisis.
&quot;He was back after seven years and life went on in Ireland, quite simply.&quot;
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
Keeping the future open and simply waiting to see how life unfolds elsewhere.
He&#39;s also had a few years of work in London and why shouldn&#39;t things be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand too?
But there is one more thing that worries him a lot these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She&#39;s afraid she might screw up at the farewell party.
&quot;No emotions at all&quot;, he says and takes a big drink of beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds disturbing.
&quot;Let&#39;s call it a going away party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.&quot;
Common practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Criminal activity is a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen by many regions as more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can track changes in attitudes across the entire region.
Two related things dominate this year&#39;s survey, which took place in September and early October.
The first is that Latin America is in a relatively cheerful mood.
The second is increasing the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific Rim in South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep drop in output last year.
But only about half of those polled in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are convinced Democrats, pulling the regional average down (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but a large increase compared to 2001, when it was 25% ( chart 3).
Around 34% said they trusted their country&#39;s parliament and 45% trusted the government, again the same numbers as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
The support arose during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latinos living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
However, the mood varies widely from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil&#39;s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
For only the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem (see Chart 5).
Around 31% say that either they themselves or a close relative have been a victim of crime in the past year, but this is down from 38% last year and is also the lowest figure since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage increased from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same opinion (and 80% there support private business), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, up from 11% last year )
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected Haiti&#39;s general election on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help a distressed country to be afraid.
Elections meant stuffed ballot boxes and repeat voting, ballots strewn across canals, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around trying to figure out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed front-runners, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that &quot;in many ways it was a pretty good election.&quot;
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they &quot;do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily invalidate the process&quot;.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his running mate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive fight is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, backed away from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But a problem could arise if Mr. Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is singled out by the electoral commission for having achieved a decisive fight.
With a cholera epidemic raging and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
About 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undistributed shortly before the elections.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians will stand up for it themselves.
Tiptoe to the center
In the weeks since she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina&#39;s president, has benefited from public sympathy, with her popularity rising from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning that achievement into a successful campaign for a second term in next year&#39;s elections may depend on whether the grieving Ms Fernández abandons the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And everything will be based on these signs.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that understated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income as they pleased.
Ms. Fernández&#39;s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized by Mr Kirchner&#39;s death of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement sided with Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which there was slapping and accusations of government corruption), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to argue,&quot; said the president.
The 2010 budget will now apply to next year as well, with the president having more room to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: growth of up to 9% is likely this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure closer to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was in the grip of economic collapse, has prioritized growth and poverty reduction rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, burdened the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistics agency that had stepped in to track official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández moderate this policy now?
She called for negotiations between private businesses and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was eroded by growth based on the big devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fernández is making it known that she wants to restore Argentina&#39;s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government forged a deal with bondholders who previously refused to restructure the debt Argentina defaulted on in 2001.
Now President Fernández faces a deal with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes roughly $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this fact should not be kept under the watchful eye of the IMF, as is usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide &quot;technical assistance&quot; to design a new national consumer-price index that would resemble the introduction of the INDEC cleanup.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to stay in politics after her term ends, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of the middle class, which is tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will be waning.
If she wants to win the next election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce many of the views her husband held in politics.
Half encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in five city districts on November 27, which can be seen as a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is representative of the sentiments that prevail towards the mainland and are strongly entrenched in business relations, including the Partial Free Trade Agreement, in the biggest rapprochement with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against the KMT&#39;s 45%.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party&#39;s share of the vote has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with the KMT in the city councils.
The election played out like most Taiwanese elections, involving noisy election trucks and mass flag-waving rallies with scantily clad girls.
It even included the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was canvassing for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien clean through the face, wounding him and killing a spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, says the shooting influenced the election, blaming the DPP and driving voters toward the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates sparred over plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and resents China&#39;s military threats.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from inciting anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and realization that Chinese trade is vital to Taiwan&#39;s economic survival.
Mr. President Ma confirmed for his party that China&#39;s policy is acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue with commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012.
In any case, the DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was at a low point: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rioter and supporter of clear independence.
But under Ms. Tsai&#39;s leadership, a new generation has developed that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been touted as the DPP&#39;s candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has unveiled plans for research institutes to serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, on the assumption that their negotiations can proceed without preconditions.
Ms Tsai is telling the Taiwanese public that her party represents a &quot;credible alternative&quot; to Mr Ma&#39;s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angered by this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen&#39;s intervention, the DPP will struggle to choose among potential candidates.
The KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma&#39;s ratings were poor, despite the breakneck pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will reorganize its cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly advocated proposals to support Taiwan to establish friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, &quot;the point of no return has already passed.&quot;
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the Best New Artist category
Performance at the request of the president and people must naturally notice.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is being tipped as one of the surprises of this year&#39;s Grammy Awards with a nomination in the best new artist category.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album &quot;Esperanza,&quot; the nomination comes a bit late, but it&#39;s in keeping with Grammy rules, which state that an artist can&#39;t release more than three albums before &quot; the public identity of that artist is established.&quot;
Her ambitious 2010 album &quot;Chamber Music Society&quot; certainly marked a step forward, and with her carefree vocal style and deft hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can refer to Spalding as the success that Norah Jones achieved in 2003, the closest the equivalent for Grammy voters looking for a similar jazz work in the category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the Grammy judges rightly praise the Vijay Iyer Trio&#39;s &quot;Historicity&quot; in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride from an album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against veteran saxophonist James Moody&#39;s &quot;Moody 4B&quot; and keyboardist John Beasley&#39;s &quot;Positootly.&quot;
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO&#39;s &quot;Treme,&quot; was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise favors albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue&#39;s wild, steampunk-informed Secret Society took some well-deserved nods in the large ensemble category, with competition from the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the ever-brave Dave Holland, whose live octet album &quot;Pathways&quot; set a fine example of how a bassist can be free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical music category
The classical music nominations at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty and his &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album &quot;Dreamhouse&quot;, an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 &quot;Los Angeles,&quot; a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
LA-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a shot at the award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, operatic, choral and solo recordings.
The Classical Music Producer of the Year category has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Classical album nominations went to Bruckner and his Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Symphony&quot; by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; &quot;Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati&quot; featuring various artists; and Verdi&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg and &quot;Lulu&quot; by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and &quot;Marc Antonio e Cleopatra&quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariah and &quot;L&#39;Amour de Loin&quot; by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina,&quot; Hans Werner Henze for &quot;Appassionatamente Plus,&quot; Magnus Lindberg for &quot;Graffiti&quot; and Shchedrin for &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer.&quot;
Pärt&#39;s Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the LA Philharmonic conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is called &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and &quot;Mandolin Concerto&quot; was nominated for an instrumental performance by soloist with orchestra.
The LA-based composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who was performing in concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
&quot;I wrote it with Middle Eastern tones and a lot of North African rhythms,&quot; Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony in a recording of Stravinsky&#39;s works.
Instrumental soloists receiving nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classical Transition category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording of &quot;Roots - My Life, My Song.&quot;
Planned mosque in Temecula receives planning commission approval
A planned mosque in Temecula won unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics assailed the project as promoting terrorism and would lead to the suspension of trade.
However, jurors ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complies with local laws and will be aesthetically pleasing.
&quot;A lot of good people came out to support this project -- Christians, Jews, you name it,&quot; Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
&quot;As an American citizen, I am very proud of that.&quot;
&quot;It means that justice will always prevail.&quot;
&quot;The opposition is minimal,&quot; he added.
&quot;Those who are against are just shouting loudly.&quot;
&quot;We have some really great people in our valley.&quot;
The meeting started at six o&#39;clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time was taken up by discussions with people who were for or against the center. Those votes were evenly split, the Press-Enterprise reports.
The discussion continued on the newspaper&#39;s website.
&quot;America doesn&#39;t exist anymore,&quot; said one comment.
“We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty sunk in the sand.
“America has fallen.
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had lived in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger, more convenient space than the warehouse space he shared with a filtration systems manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot, Mediterranean-style mosque will also have two minarets and rise to a height of 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes raise the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the search for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and they say it&#39;s a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside of the main elements that have so far been considered fundamental.
“This organism has a dual ability.
&quot;It can grow on either phosphorus or arsenic.&quot;
&quot;This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that this is some form of truly &#39;alien&#39; life,&quot; commented Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur - were considered necessary for life.
However, the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing after phosphorus is substituted for arsenic.
&quot;You start to wonder what else is possible,&quot; said Arizona State University&#39;s Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report.
The finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a news report published to discuss it, which did not reveal details of the find, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It is not so.
The discovery &quot;shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we think of as &#39;standard&#39; may not be so absolutely necessary for life,&quot; explained Charles Cockell, professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
&quot;This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure,&quot; added Cockell.
It wasn&#39;t a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA&#39;s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she reasoned that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to substitute one for the other.
&quot;Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus.&quot;
&quot;As a result, organisms have a very hard time separating these elements from each other.&quot;
&quot;However, arsenic is so different that it doesn&#39;t work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes,&quot; Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt to and grow.
Microbes grow better when exposed to phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, it raises the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon. where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus is not new, but no example has ever been found to prove this fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculate that earlier life forms may have used it.
&quot;This suggests that there may have been other ways to form life, not just the way it formed in the early Earth period,&quot; said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel have been found. The sheriff of the Los Angeles area informed about it on Thursday.
Four show dogs -- two Akitas and a Pembroke Welsh Corgi -- disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in at the Bellflower 6 Motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were found Wednesday afternoon, and the other two dogs were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department.
&quot;The good news is the dogs are OK,&quot; Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.
“They have been turned over to their rightful owners.
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor would he share detailed information about how they were found.
“The investigation is still ongoing.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to talk about it,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;We follow the rules.&quot;
The dogs&#39; owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment on the case.
They were overjoyed when their two Akitas were found at the shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff&#39;s deputies found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas Trace, a 3-year-old dog named Trace, and 10-month-old female Didi were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had planned to compete in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unaccounted for until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were scheduled to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on the couple&#39;s nearly monthly dog show travels.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their cars outside their room windows.
They also took three dogs with them - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a brittany hound - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akitas and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the missing dogs. Dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was unclear Thursday whether awards would be presented.
The lion is ready to roar again now that MGM&#39;s restructuring is getting final court approval
After 18 months of upheaval and uncertainty, MGM was finally given the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially gave his blessing to creditors&#39; &quot;prepackaged&quot; plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of movies and TV shows.
Thursday&#39;s ruling that the plan meets U.S. bankruptcy requirements leaves no legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become chief executives of the slimmed-down studio.
The number of employees will drop to around 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financing sources allowing for a $500 million loan to finance MGM&#39;s new operations and productions.
Now it&#39;s a tie-up with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected around mid-December.
The studio&#39;s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances as management struggled to afford $300 million in annual interest payments.
That August, chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and turnaround expert known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper&#39;s attempts to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and the studio&#39;s 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none were willing to pay the US$2 billion plus financing demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper&#39;s firms will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis &amp; Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper&#39;s companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that manage the company&#39;s operations, will receive a $4 million success fee.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has only released one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films based on the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to take out a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM&#39;s debt, sought the possibility of merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
This year&#39;s leading contender is the iPad for coolest toy, followed by the video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 beaded jump ropes or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and BJ&#39;s Wholesale Club - to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore&#39;s Law was at work; this year&#39;s tech toys have far more power, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to years past.
While there have been relatively few new toys with affiliate websites, the two most popular toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys &quot;R&quot; Us unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, ages 3 and up) are stuffed animals that sing when you squeeze their bellies.
With one press, the animal emits a tone, and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and in harmony.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can&#39;t stop.
The best choice for a combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, ages 2 and up)
Last year I rented a 14 inch animatronic doll from Elmo Live technology that can play Simon Says and can also moonwalk thanks to its innovative folding leg with locking wheels.
Kids test the Mickey dance instructor toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you&#39;re a child of the 80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
He&#39;s back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, ages 3 and up), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn car rides into work fun with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you&#39;re eyeing a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech&#39;s MobiGo ($60, for ages 3-8) is the cheapest, easy-to-use option with a qwerty keyboard, though the games don&#39;t have as effective instruction as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for ages 3-12), the first major a change to the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
Neither version is backwards compatible.
Fisher-Price&#39;s iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to load games and e-books, and has an SD card slot to display family photos.
And finally, the Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five dice no bigger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a row before time runs out; it&#39;s great for impromptu word building competitions.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
The two toys Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented to the highest extent in toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2&quot; Mix &#39;N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6-12), which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough Club Penguin store credits for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle animal.
Slightly larger than the bristles of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for ages 5 and up), the latest in a line of coin-operated micro-robots.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It&#39;s fun to make a maze out of cubes and see if he manages to find his way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog&#39;s mouth.
The introduction of finer policing in China
As the city&#39;s military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members - China&#39;s stout enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their harshness and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to the crowd of bystanders.
&quot;Stand up straight!&quot;
&quot;Hurry up!&quot;
Show them, he whispers quietly, &quot;what pretty girls look like!&quot;
Four very young girls in white gloves and matching olive coats and trousers stood to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are lined up like a ruler.
The four headpieces sit perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
&quot;Personally, I think they look average,&quot; Mr. Tang said dismissively.
&quot;The models are nice.&quot;
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city mandated that new conscripts have a college degree.
Guangdong province changed their grey-green uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced stares with heavy weaponry: in 2009, one report said 50 officers doggedly surrounded a snack cart and glared at the owner until the hawker packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, an urban district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its city police force, selected specifically for their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into China&#39;s secret urban groups.
Critics would argue with good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat a bystander to death after he used his cell phone to film what they were doing during a crackdown on a landfill protest.
Last year, police training was taking place in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and posted on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat up an offender without signs of blood.
This year, a watermelon peddler in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered an injury to the left side of his brain.
One violent video game that can be downloaded online shows Chinese policemen attacking street vendors.
&quot;Chengguan has scared the government,&quot; China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after further discussion of the tactic.
The paper said &quot;really thoroughly cleaned.&quot;
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised for eight new female police officers in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real duties or were merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district required female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and &quot;five facial features in proper proportion.&quot;
Female adepts should be taller than the average - i.e. taller than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials claim that the work is too mentally demanding for women over 25.
&quot;Their image is an important thing,&quot; one unnamed police officer told Rednet.com, a purported government website.
&quot;Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which are then determined by others, including height, weight, facial features, etc.&quot;
Then comes nature and &quot;inner qualities&quot;.
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, &quot;Besides being vases, they will also have other responsibilities.&quot;
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the county town management, strongly disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
&quot;He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked person to serve with us,&quot; Mr. Zheng said.
“His image would not be good.
Liu Yi, who keeps watch in Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with apple-shaped cheeks and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn&#39;t think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
&quot;Do you think I look hot in this uniform?&quot; she asked with a wry look.
Her dimpled colleague, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, &quot;Our job is to represent the image of the city.&quot;
They don&#39;t mind their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are bigger than just herding traders into aisles to ply their trade.
Every morning, the group faces more than ten market vendors who run around on foot or on bicycles, trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are chased away.
“Mr. Wang, you must leave.
&quot;We&#39;ve told you many times before!&quot; Miss Xu said as the market hawker started to run away, leaving his noodle cart bike for a while.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
&quot;It&#39;s basically the same thing every day,&quot; said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in her spare time.
“The big routine.
One reason is that female police officers do not have the same powers as their male counterparts to confiscate goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male superiors.
The tendency then is to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens rioted in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after false rumors spread that police had killed vendors.
More than ten police officers or constables were injured during the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where policewomen were on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Police seized the motorcycle, which was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the shop as required by regulations.
The bike owner could cry all he wanted.
15 minutes away from the cops, looking angry, elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men&#39;s group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like the female police officers, the coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in image maintenance and polishing.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
&quot;Usually it&#39;s the public that starts it.&quot;
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Sen. John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his lobbying efforts, the senator&#39;s lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who, until the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign&#39;s office said it was &quot;certainly pleased&quot; with the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign said that the Justice Department &quot;has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there are no plans to bring any further charges against him in this matter.&quot;
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was substantial evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 by the New York Times said Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his aides, secure a lucrative lobbying effort to silence Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia. about the senator&#39;s affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once worked as Ensign&#39;s campaign treasurer.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and supported their views after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, documents and interviews state.
Because Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign&#39;s assistant, he was barred by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared to violate a lobbying ban.
The evidence that was released &quot;shows that this is a clear case of preparation to violate the law,&quot; said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are under government investigation.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in Sen. Ensign&#39;s case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits after a string of setbacks, including last year&#39;s decision to suspend a lawsuit against the former senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.
Federal prosecutors &quot;clearly hid their guns,&quot; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
&quot;It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the laws,&quot; she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign&#39;s lead lawyer, said in an interview that a Justice Department prosecutor called him Monday and then the next day and told him the department had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign&#39;s defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, &quot;acted within the law.&quot;
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
&quot;I&#39;m not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice other than that we think they made the right decision,&quot; he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt its investigation into a separate complaint filed by an ethics group alleging that a $96,000 payment by Ensign&#39;s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove the money was nothing more than a donation.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began acting as a lobbyist at the company, Mr. Ensign&#39;s chief of staff -- John Lopez -- communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him he had been &quot;pounding&quot; the Interior Department about the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and urged the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hire Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first emerged last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican leader of the Senate.
After months of stalling, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he plans to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics commission would quickly follow the Justice Department&#39;s lead and close the entire investigation.
&quot;Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,&quot; she continued.
Cheshire Municipality&#39;s appeal is taking to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were writing in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute they sent news of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says more than 140,000 messages on Twitter dealt with children being raped and tied to beds in the house, which was set on fire.
The retrial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, families, was held Thursday and was set to officially conclude with the imposition of the death penalty, which the jury voted for.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already filed an appeal with the court, with requests and arguments that are likely to keep the court busy for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the trial - including the widespread use of Twitter by key reporters - created a &quot;circus atmosphere&quot; and that this widespread, immediate infiltration of information with outrageous details then misled the jury in its decision in terms of being swayed by public opinion.
This claim could force judges to consider whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules in the courtroom should also be required.
&quot;As I have experienced in this retrial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technologies into the courtroom affects the due process rights of individuals,&quot; said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes&#39; lead defense attorney.
State Superior Court Judge Jon C. Blue summarily dismissed the claims regarding last week&#39;s verdict, saying the media was &quot;carefully controlled&quot; and that there was no evidence to suggest the jury was influenced by the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell, there was a &quot;carnival atmosphere&quot; at the trial because of the media.
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and movie &quot;The Fugitive.&quot;
Some lawyers have said that appeals courts reviewing Hayes&#39;s ruling half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to dictate how communications are conducted outside courtrooms, which was the case in Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
&quot;There is general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media&quot; in high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be biased by the idea that limiting direct communication from courtrooms may make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes&#39; lawyers, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Defense attorneys also say, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudiced when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photographs of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty, saying the judge improperly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision improperly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to deliberate over the weekend.
Jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the most interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict handed down last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly fanning the flames of emotions about the case.
&quot;The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in front of the court,&quot; the lawyer wrote, &quot;was something never before seen here in New Haven and perhaps a national rarity.&quot;
Their focus on Twitter&#39;s influence is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more inflammatory than the reports given later and in their view the judicial police should control the scope of further trials.
But some lawyers have called for appeals courts, with the oft-used argument that social and technological changes require courts to adapt.
Mr. Hayes&#39; lawyers are pushing for that right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court from 1966 in the case of the judgment of Dr. Sheppard, due to the breadth of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
&quot;This case,&quot; they wrote, &quot;represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century.&quot;
Can politeness bridge the gap?
After a campaign notable for its profanity and negativism, there has been little civility in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday&#39;s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no major breakthroughs on the major issues that must be discussed during the session.
But in any case, this was a polite discussion addressing the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of partisan infighting.
Wednesday&#39;s public meeting of the president&#39;s deficit commission was also civil, despite political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that working closely together over several months has built a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides the members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in a trial period - probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to gauge the limits of public opinion and voters&#39; patience with renewed partisan warfare.
Therefore, Tuesday&#39;s meeting and its later evaluation by the participants was carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a quick reversal of the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it&#39;s taxes, spending, health care or rights, the two sides are miles apart.
Nevertheless, Washington prepared the November elections quickly, to say the least.
&quot;It&#39;s not a question of whether the regulatory issues have changed,&quot; said Pete Wehner, a Bush administrator now with the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
&quot;These are inevitable after the elections.
The election stirred up the emotions of the parties and then they died down.
It&#39;s good.&quot;
On several issues, especially those to be debated in session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding solutions.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one sees that as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Much like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because Republicans can&#39;t watch them support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday&#39;s meeting at the White House, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of a new opening agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to a bipartisan relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
&quot;After the things that have to be done are done, in the short term psychology will return to one of confrontation,&quot; he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism—which is largely widespread—that politeness will lead to genuine cooperation.
&quot;I look at everything between now and 2012 as a shadow box where the major events will happen in 2012,&quot; he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Now faced with the danger of exaggeration, Republican leaders know they must follow through on their promises to cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
Those partisan lines are clear in the initial reactions to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in their view, pushing the deficit issue onto the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation, and are fighting to get as close to that number as possible.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials on the panel, who suggest that we have, at least today, little basis or will for compromise when it comes to financial issues.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and House Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of partisan conflict as Republicans challenge Obama to tackle the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that despite the partisanship of the last election, most Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If it could be headed for a stalemate, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public&#39;s reaction very carefully.
Anyone threatened with a vote reduction is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
That may be an optimistic view of things.
Partisanship and alignment are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and a greater ideological divide appears to have developed between Obama and House Republicans than there was between the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on that reality, the civility that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document depicts Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city is run by a &quot;kleptocracy&quot; and it continues with some of the bribes and protection kickbacks that make their way to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia said in a February filing.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the &quot;vertical of office&quot; - will take its toll as the money starts moving up the ladder.
The tape, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was released on Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor and accuses him of a large part in corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can observe only minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction firm, have consistently denied corruption allegations for many years, and have won several perjury lawsuits over such allegations.
He told a Russian television station in September when asked about proven evidence of corruption: &quot;It&#39;s crazy, it&#39;s dirt, it&#39;s crap.&quot;
Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show at the polls.
However, it is unusual to come across such details told in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
&quot;Moscow&#39;s city government and its ties to criminal elements have led some to call it &#39;dysfunctional,&#39; and confirm that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government,&quot; the report said.
&quot;Criminal elements enjoy the so-called &#39;krysha&#39; (a term from the criminal and mafia world that literally means &#39;roof&#39; or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the State representative, as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
&quot;Analysts have identified a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow.&quot;
&quot;Luzhkov is at the very top.&quot;
&quot;The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are on the second level.&quot;
&quot;And finally, at the lowest level are common criminals and corrupt inspectors.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s an ineffective system where criminal gangs fill in the gaps in some areas because the city doesn&#39;t provide some services.&quot;
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest firms and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, &quot;shop owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Internal Affairs (rather than from organized crime groups), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law. &quot;
&quot;For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in vogue.&quot;
The record says that while the collection of money is complex, the protection itself may already have difficulties; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay quickly enough have their shops closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
An embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, presumably stuffed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
&quot;In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats,&quot; Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow-based research group Indem, said in a recent interview.
&quot;But it&#39;s part of this bureaucracy.&quot;
&quot;He is not part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia anymore.&quot;
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationally, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, certainly did not excite the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow&#39;s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue for a solution to the problem .
In an interview with CNN&#39;s Larry King, Putin said that the documents published by WikiLeaks could be fakes and reacted angrily to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
&quot;The truth of the matter is that it is our mutual cooperation that is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,&quot; he said.
&quot;But to be honest, we didn&#39;t think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethically.&quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans are forced to come to terms with the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with soiled and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who built it, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok.
&quot;He was a good leader and cared about his people,&quot; said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as &quot;the butcher&quot; for his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge abdicated, long-standing loyalties have been shattered in Anlong Veng as well.
In April, victims were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and its former soldiers to children.
And in July, the United Nations and a Cambodian court jointly brought the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng violent group, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest has grown among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
&quot;There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything,&quot; said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
&quot;For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil.&quot;
“It tears families apart.
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to Cambodia&#39;s border with Thailand.
There they started an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary ran guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, following a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to its first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters sank into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the days of the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains tenuous as unskilled farmers.
&quot;These people benefited minimally from the surrender,&quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
&quot;They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.&quot;
“They were brought up without any idea of doing business.
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungles around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
&quot;Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,&quot; he said.
“Ta Mok fed everyone.
“But now life is hard because we have to provide everything ourselves.
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the masterminds and people responsible for the crimes, but has not said whether it will pursue the four cases.
It did little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared across the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
&quot;Cambodia is peaceful and stable,&quot; she said.
&quot;If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.&quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned of instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
&quot;Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it,&quot; he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
&quot;Reconciliation in the Khmer context means putting the broken pieces back together,&quot; he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken pieces back together so we can understand each other.
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages long and titled &quot;History of Democratic Cambodia.&quot;
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to a Ministry of Education history textbook that contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the town&#39;s association with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
&quot;My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute.&quot;
Such opposition makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the courts are starting to have an impact, he continued.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a road overgrown with weeds and littered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot&#39;s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone seller, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated at the site.
&quot;But he has a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him,&quot; she said.
It was Nuom Sothea&#39;s birthday and she planned to visit Pol Pot&#39;s resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her good luck.
Belarus agrees to divest its stockpile of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama&#39;s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after a security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium for years, and they appeared to have hit a stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a pair of covert operations were conducted with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday&#39;s deal to remove the rest of the material — about 500 pounds, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is sensitive.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama&#39;s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, from which Belarus was excluded.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
&quot;I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.&quot;
&quot;This proves that the process is working,&quot; said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal a &quot;very significant, important step&quot; by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did so during the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama&#39;s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
&quot;We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium,&quot; Lukashenko said afterwards.
“It&#39;s our commodity...We&#39;re not going to make dirty bombs, and we&#39;re not going to sell it to anybody.
&quot;We&#39;re just using it for research purposes, that&#39;s all.&quot;
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarus&#39; uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was concluded on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government has spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply a Belarusian research institute with low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for making nuclear weapons.
&quot;Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust&quot; that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the Study of Nuclear Nonproliferation estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, aim to eliminate its stockpile by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, largely due to Lukashenko&#39;s brutal crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday&#39;s statement suggests the possibility of a gradual thaw.
&quot;Welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people,&quot; he said.
The Spanish government did not skimp on CIA flights
The Spanish government has been tight-lipped about CIA flights transporting imprisoned Taliban and al-Qaida members to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, the United States ambassador to Madrid said in a cable.
This is what follows from the documents provided by the Wikileaks server to El País, where it is also written that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and &quot;could thus demonstrate that it has proper supervision over foreign aircraft flying through Spanish territory airspace&quot;.
in June 2006, following the Council of Europe&#39;s communique accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe&#39;s communication had &quot;taken the Zapatero government out of the game&quot; and insisted Spain had nothing to hide on the matter.
De la Vega emphasized that Spain has no problem with secret service flights over its territory.
&quot;They simply want to be informed&quot; so that they are not &quot;caught off guard,&quot; Aguirre says in one of the documents.
Also, the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, indicated to the American ambassador that the Spanish government &quot;wanted to give this matter as low a profile as possible, but since this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence&quot;.
in February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge&#39;s initiative to request the declassification of National Intelligence Center (CNI) and Defense Department documents related to CIA flights.
&quot;This information does not contain any incriminating material or any sensitive information,&quot; the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern over &quot;apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors&quot; rather than the declassification of CNI or Defense Ministry information.
&quot;This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,&quot; regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of the US ambassador and the minister of the interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that &quot;although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit&quot;, he had already given instructions to his colleagues &quot;to avoid heated comments with the intention of reducing tension&quot;.
The ambassador also expresses his concerns regarding the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech Lidová strana - translation note) in this matter.
&quot;Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular will not hesitate to seize on any indication that the Zapatero government has condoned or willfully ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if that these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government,&quot; he notes.
Confessed mother-murderer complained on the network about maternal &quot;worry&quot;
A young woman spoke about the child when it was already dead and had her blog: &quot;Terror after Galicia&quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself &quot;Muki&quot; on the Internet.
she communicated with her cousin and at least one female friend with this nickname, which she used from an early age; both are from the municipality of Noia in the region of La Coruña, where the young woman comes from.
The news is from 2008.
In order to be able to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman&#39;s emotional life, which the ABC newspaper reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
The thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They dated for one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn child was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little César lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her in Palma for a week.
However, it is evident from the content of her communication that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: &quot;Alberto is kind of upset that I left for work.&quot;
&quot;When I told him, he thought it was fine, but now she realizes that she has to be with the little one all day and she can&#39;t do what he wants.&quot;
Then she talks about the text message she just received: &quot;I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send the baby&quot;.
She complains: &quot;If he doesn&#39;t like me leaving the little one with my mother, I&#39;ll marry him when I come back,&quot; she claims.
in May he talks about his return to his place of residence: &quot;I will go there this week, but I will only stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go for work, so as not to lose the place&quot;.
She explains that if all goes well, she will take her son in with her.
&quot;He&#39;ll be with who he&#39;s meant to be with, me, and there&#39;s no way in my life I&#39;ll leave him with anyone but my mother,&quot; a dubious intent given her bad relationships.
there is another post in July.
As she types this message, the child who arrived on the island on the first of this month and was presumably murdered on the 10th is believed to be dead.
&quot;Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but not on the other.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand, he is with me and he quite likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day&quot;.
He talks about moving to Mallorca.
&quot;(Son) will be going to summer school there, so I&#39;ll save a little money for a babysitter.&quot;
Seventeenth Greetings and Complaints.
&quot;A big kiss from César asking me when you&#39;re coming.&quot;
&quot;Alberto says he sent you I don&#39;t know what videos to your email, watch as he likes, meet me, sex is needed&quot;.
On the 30th another message: &quot;The boy is doing well, he is going to summer school to learn Catalan&quot;.
There is also one message about Víctor, the current partner: &quot;He gives me money&quot;.
On the Internet, there are Mónica&#39;s posts on anime and manga blogs.
She even had her own MySpace, now revised, calling herself &quot;Muki ex-prisoner&quot;.
&quot;Terror after Galicia (motto)&quot;.
The last man she lived with, a guard, expresses his regret and guilt.
He doesn&#39;t want to believe that everything happened because she didn&#39;t tell him she was a single mother.
Yesterday, Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said that the accused does not remember how everything happened and &quot;that she did not intend to harm the little one&quot;.
Before that, however, she admitted that she drowned César in the bathtub and put his body in a trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric evaluation.
The People&#39;s Party would gain 4 seats in the House of Representatives and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia - translation note) would lose 9 mandates
with the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main say in the town halls of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes obtained and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People&#39;s Party of Catalonia - note trans.) already has a given idea about the general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually once that of Catalan elections.
in 2008 the Catalan People&#39;s Party won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections the number was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People&#39;s Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, is maintained, the party&#39;s analysts have calculated that if the general elections are held, the PPC could win 12 deputies in the Chamber compared to the current 8, the CiU party (Convergencia i Unió, Shoda a unie in Czech - translation note) would also gain 4 seats (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers Party).
According to this analysis by the People&#39;s Party, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia - note trans.) party would lose one MP - it now has 3 - while the ICV (Initiative of the Greens for Catalonia - note trans.) would continue to have one mandate, possibly gain one more next.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the closest showdown will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the People&#39;s Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialist rule in the four main provincial cities and also on changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and populists agree that the PSC could lose city halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get a majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona council - as a minimum of 5% of the vote must be obtained.
The PP party increased the number of votes obtained in the four capital cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are confident they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lleida, the PP won only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
People also won in other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
currently the PP is represented in 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
A Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven detained in Barcelona, another three were detained in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand that arranged passports for various Al-Qaeda groups, including the &quot;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&quot; and the &quot;Lashkar-e- Taiba&quot;, while the latter group was responsible for the 2008 Mumbai bombings that killed 106 people.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, it aims to ensure with the help of &quot;Operation Kampai&quot; the weakening of Al-Qaeda&#39;s counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and &quot;thus limiting its operational capabilities&quot;.
Investigators estimate that during the two years it was active in Catalonia, the cell may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then forged and then supplied to groups that make up the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their &quot;fighters&quot; could travel with impunity across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active one that the Jihad network had in Europe, and therefore, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units also participated in these investigations, and it cannot be ruled out that there will not be similar interventions in other European countries in the following days in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (in which the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) another one developed in Thailand, during which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was these men who ran a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole passports from tourists that met the demands of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, they had to be valid for several years and they had to be without marked visas.
In the investigative documents, it is emphasized that there are no known facts linking the detainees from Catalonia to the Mumbai attack, although the author of these attacks, &quot;Lashkar-e-Taiba&quot;, was supposed to be one of the groups that accepted the passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which was &quot;put&quot; to buy cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the &quot;commando&quot;, which killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People&#39;s Party (PP) is demanding Maso stop the fiscal deal
The president of the PPC (People&#39;s Party of Catalonia), Alicia Sánchezový-Camachová, yesterday had the opportunity to personally present to Arturo Mas her conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and abandon risky ventures such as the economic deal that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People&#39;s Party came to the meeting with Arturo Mas with the certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in last Sunday&#39;s elections, a number more than satisfactory to gain popularity, therefore the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment to the office.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliance that the nationalists would like to keep in the House when the general elections are held, but so far the talks that Mas is having these days with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to get her support for the inauguration, &quot;he will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches&quot;, as well as the economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque Country - which the CiU leader even wanted to put to a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the autonomous administration&#39;s bloated political apparatus and cut inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations regarding Masa&#39;s inauguration will be dealt with within the PP party Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatric facility director assures deaths not due to &#39;lack of precautions&#39;
The representatives of the Olot center do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed there - killed at least eleven elderly people in his care.
The director of this nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the facility&#39;s lawyer, attorney Joan Canada, and announced that &quot;the wish of the La Caritat home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit&quot; responsible for the killing, however, &quot;legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities&quot;.
In addition to the damage to the reputation that the institution may suffer due to the fact that it did not detect the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the great threat to the La Caritat home is now the demands for material compensation, which are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the bereaved families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of the home for the elderly, suspecting that in many cases no doctor examined the deceased personally, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
Yesterday, through its director, La Caritat resolutely rejected this extremism and emphasized that &quot;the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened&quot;.
The legal representative of La Caritat added that &quot;there are no indications in the case that any third party, apart from the accused himself, committed misconduct&quot;.
The man now nicknamed the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; admitted yesterday to 11 murders and specified that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed the second old woman.
in this case he caused death by giving too much insulin, unlike in the first case when he used a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat said that it is complicated to control the staff&#39;s access to medication.
In six out of nine cases, insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were likely the means used by this caregiver to kill patients in an effort to relieve their suffering.
However, only the analyzes that are now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is not lying and was really looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by administering lye, as he already admitted in the case of the three women killed between October 12 and 17.
in La Caritat, they do not believe the medic&#39;s claims, nor do they rule out that the number of people killed may be higher than what he admitted, justifying his behavior in the various versions that Vila presented to the court, knowing that he had to change his actions when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That&#39;s why they say they want to be available to the justice system so that the full extent of the matter can be brought to light.
The European Central Bank is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday&#39;s threat by the president of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that &quot;the markets should not underestimate our ability to react&quot;.
Margin differentials closed strongly and shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above a critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market which, although falling, is recovering - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose concern.
A month ago, the European Central Bank cited us to withdraw the liquidity measure today, and tomorrow it will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded an end to the government debt buyback plan for ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline, leaving unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect them to forecast the level of liquidity &quot;until at least March&quot; and keep the three-month tender with unlimited access until the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond buying program and even announce an intensification of it.
If they fail to live up to the expectations created, they will recreate yesterday&#39;s market reaction, and if they continue to blindly continue to pull down the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at the convention in May where they claimed they weren&#39;t even thinking about buying bonds and the markets collapsed - history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
in May, the armored fist announced on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought many, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday&#39;s auction of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting the change in market sentiment that Trichet said had occurred.
in Ireland, figures were released representing Allied and Bank of Ireland losses.
The estimated amounts represent roughly 10,000 million in short-term securities and another potential 15,000, which have a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem through stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the bailout plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will need to get a new budget approved by parliament next Tuesday and still lacks support, so uncertainty remains in Ireland.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of her speech to ease tensions ahead of the next meeting of EU leaders on December 14, where a political compromise must be reached to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven&#39;s Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister yesterday had the opportunity to present a plan of measures that will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - to the ears of investors it sounds like the Four Seasons by Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5%, double that of other European stock markets.
In contrast to February, the reaction of the government and the National Bank of Spain was quick and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
We have a key three-year bond auction here today, which will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will see strong demand to help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash we don&#39;t need - 40,000 million in cash is available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - then high rates and access to the markets would be closed sine die.
However, one must continue to use the strategy of Cesar&#39;s woman - &quot;not only to be it, but also to seem it&quot;.
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen group challenges the actions of the Vega Sicilia company requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not subside.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, attacks, after he considered it &quot;completely insignificant&quot;, the legal action of El Enebro company scheduled for the 16th of this month and requested by five of his seven descendants, in which they should try to force their majority and seize with the help of the administrative authorities of the prosecution of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal team for a new chapter in their dispute over control of part of the company.
The founder of the largest business services holding does not seem willing to let up in his dispute over membership of the governing bodies of the El Enebro group.
he was ousted from its administrative committee by five of his seven descendants, who named themselves leaders during the shareholders&#39; meeting on January 18 of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was convened by the official of the Commercial Court number 2 in Madrid, renewed the thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Until the dispute is resolved, an appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of the commission.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquirizo is considered by David Álvarez to be &quot;a desperate means by his five children serving, through judicial trickery and clear legal fraud, to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18, which were completely invalid&quot;.
This argumentation will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this action as &quot;completely insignificant&quot;.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried without success to have the court convene a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, the group that owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, the seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group demands the right to use 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key question that the judge will have to decide when re-examining the question of judicial challenge of the conduct. The date of this makeover has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests improvements in vehicles in real time.
Ever since Red Bull burst into the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newly arrived team very seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Fernando Alonso&#39;s Ferrari.
Without wanting to diminish the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that powers his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula 1 - the &quot;secret weapon&quot; that the multinational Siemens placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it victorious team.
In fact, it is a powerful software that simulates marches, which the German company launched on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from motor sports.
So-called PLM, this powerful software tool has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants, and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous commercial vehicles of the Nissan brand.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens&#39; industrial division, explains that the use of this software tool allowed the Red Bull team to make &quot;within hours, in almost real time&quot; modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were only able to make three or four refinements at most in a season.
180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology work today in the Red Bull team, who analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
An executive from Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull&#39;s race cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser manufacturing systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical sophistication is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend per season to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings to which visitors - especially journalists - are restricted.
Everything that happens here is considered a &quot;big secret&quot;.
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull&#39;s hero in Formula 1 is undoubtedly the new champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the immeasurable technological resources that the energy drink brand has invested in its participation on the racing circuit, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable and yet nobody knows them.
Head of Manufacturing Technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development accounted for 50% of victories and the rest was down to the drivers.
nowadays, this ratio has changed, and technology accounts for 85% of achievements, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing as they are &quot;unpredictable gladiators&quot;.
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in cooperation with local distributors within two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes yesterday solemnly opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This venture will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 already existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrerová, vice-president of the Spanish HP, cited as an example the newly rebuilt store on Barcelona&#39;s Gran Vía, belonging to the Pont Reyes company, with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company has drawn up a plan to set up 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), making the store in Barcelona the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal where the next stores would be opened, but she admitted that Madrid could be one of the next locations.
Herrerová, who also heads HP personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will still be the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises here with an exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be tried interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also deals with staffing for stores.
Helena Herrerová denied that it was franchising and emphasized that the exclusive chain of stores aims to &quot;improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises during purchase, service, after-sales service and even packaging&quot;.
The store in Barcelona is part of a pioneering world-class pilot program aimed at solving possible problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to the technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
&quot;That way we&#39;ll be able to solve problems in 10 minutes that might otherwise take up to two days.&quot;
&quot;This system is intended especially for small and medium-sized businesses and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service&quot;, stressed Helena Herrerová yesterday.
Sabadell is betting that it will &quot;steal&quot; a million clients from its competitors within three years
More optimistic than other bosses, the delegated member of the board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be difficult for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, he expects a reduction in interest rates, which he will try to compensate for by lowering bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to have one million private clients within three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new strategic plan valid for three years.
The goal is, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public assistance in FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000 if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - as until now the institution has tended to pamper small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share for private clients is 3.5%, while for business customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, with the aim of reducing costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
Few banking institutions dare to set goals and publish them at this time, because the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
This year, Sabadell will close its Optima program, established four years ago, although it was initially for three years, but the market situation required an extension for another period.
Clients who leave savings banks will be their main target group.
At a meeting organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be &quot;difficult and very important&quot;.
Indeed, he believes that the path out of the crisis in Spain &quot;will be lengthy&quot;.
In addition, it will be &quot;very difficult to create employment&quot; in two or three years, which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although they believe the passive war - which reduces margins - is receding, the price of risk premiums that banks and savings banks pay on their issues to receive liquidity is already being passed on to loan prices, offsetting the reduction in margins.
&quot;The theme of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit&quot;.
&quot;We haven&#39;t turned off the tap yet, but the differentials are very high&quot;, admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking &quot;now is to reduce commissions&quot;, but there is a &quot;competitive framework&quot;.
Bank Sabadell&#39;s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain &quot;larger sizes will be requested&quot;.
&quot;Next year, no stone will be left unturned&quot;, he assured.
He confirms that the capital needs are &quot;much reduced&quot; and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter the red numbers.
And he points out that FROB can substitute in the market for raising funds before a new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, what some bankers predict will be a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
He notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike in June, it is possible to receive short-term financing using repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA rules out another wave of savings bank mergers
CECA&#39;s CEO denied yesterday that there would be another wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the sector is being reorganized.
When the process of consolidating Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the CEO of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out a new wave of these operations yesterday.
&quot;I believe that most of the mergers have already been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening is the conventions&quot;.
&quot;Most of it is completely done; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all the big processes are already done and under the protection of the National Bank of Spain, which cooperated very well in this matter&quot;, noted the director.
In his statements at the meeting of ADEA (Association of Executive and Executive Officials of Aragon) Olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is taking place &quot;at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied as it is shown in the installments that at the time, not now , discovered in business plans with the National Bank of Spain&quot;, he emphasized.
&quot;Going from 45 savings banks with an average volume of assets of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, thus reducing the number of institutions by 62% in order to make them larger and therefore in line with the Basel Treaty&quot;, he underlined.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that &quot;there are a number of not very happy opinions about the slowness of the process&quot; that show &quot;a lack of seriousness and understanding&quot; because &quot;what the National Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we have to meet the deadline before the end of the year&quot;.
CECA director general José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and &quot;probably&quot; in the world, accusing those who doubted it of a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot;.
The director noted that with the current favorable economic situation, &quot;we can be calm&quot; about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as the system, which has mastered the &quot;very important&quot; process of concentration and which continues &quot;at the highest possible speed.&quot;
He also reminded that the Spanish banking industry came out very well from the stress tests conducted by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the red German line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set conditions for the entire Union.
The tension in the markets provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized businesses, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the cancellation of 426 euros for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Control - note. transl.), manager of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice President Elena Salgadová, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel because of her responsibility for unleashing the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel&#39;s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which runs counter to the idea of upholding old traditions held by much of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first of them is represented by a strong euro zone, which would include Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the marque - although it may seem like science fiction now, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third possibility, according to the German proposals, is the reworking of the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigor, fines for guilty states, possible payment deferrals for some of them, and the extension of the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for pushbacks now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany thought was right (fiscal austerity plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully dragged out the decision regarding the rescue of Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against bailing out Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel appeared again with a clear position, when she demanded to reform the conventions of the European Union in such a way that it would be possible to rescue a member state and, at the same time, that private creditors would be obliged to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, her proposal, albeit in a somewhat toned down form, was approved, and over the coming months we should be watching the reform process of the Union, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, although measures must now be taken that he seems to disagree with, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new currency area, in which states that break the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report deferred payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict growth path with increased savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and construction, with huge balance of payments gaps, such as prevailed during Spain&#39;s boom years, they are simply not going to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we would be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions we might make a mistake ourselves.
I hope that this current turbulence will be replaced by greater calm.
And that we will use the opportunity they are giving us until the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this as well, and his double announcement (reforms promised after last Saturday&#39;s meeting with big business and yesterday&#39;s announcement of new measures) suggests that criticism of Merkel has opened the way to the idea that things need to be put in ok
But the red line that Germany drew is here, and it doesn&#39;t seem like it wants to move.
And from the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone, which is full of not very serious countries, cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumventing the rules
Feints like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show intelligence, not an intention to escape punishment.
The alleged orchestrated suspensions of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23rd has caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this was unsportsmanlike conduct and whether or not UEFA should ban both footballers punish.
Famously, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won), the named players one by one deliberately wasted time when a foul was about to be played, in order to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will serve their punishment in the following match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing top of their group - and will be able to proceed to the next stage without their cards.
In the end, UEFA&#39;s disciplinary committee handed coach José Mourinho a two-match ban and the offending players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. the rules that are unwritten but followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the team Real Madrid (who boast of nobility and honor in their anthem, and who have already fined their players for similar actions) were involved, and also, it seems, due to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adding another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of action, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is in conflict with the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts circumvent the law; these are indeed events respecting sports rules, the meaning of which, however, seems to be being circumvented.
What type of damage such actions do to the spirit of sportsmanship is addressed.
One of the requisites of sportsmanship is the physical inviolability of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, i.e. there was no violent play.
Another of these essentials of fair play is to avoid giving players an advantage over the opposing team due to their offense - which did not happen here.
So the paradoxical thing about the action of the Real Madrid players is the fact that there was not what we normally characterize as trickery or circumvention of the law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid a sanction, but this behavior should have been as visible as possible in order to receive a penalty.
They waited and were happy to receive the punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage the culprits will have from their intentional offense.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that no benefit is achieved in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it&#39;s not even a useful strategy for the next match, since the club won&#39;t be able to count on these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could jeopardize their participation in a future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first sight the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by doing this, the players will get rid of the penalty, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which one card less than in round one.
So as the rounds go on it won&#39;t be entirely clear if this is an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of sportsmanship, part of which is to make strategic decisions that allow for maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case at hand, the players did not aim to avoid the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or running from punishment.
Although the line between ingenuity and circumventing the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly ingenuity.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions to provoke them were transmitted from the management.
Damage to sporting principles by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
A bidding war to organize Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictates of the calendar concentrate this year&#39;s avalanche of reservations on December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in the number of celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or the lottery, with the arrival of December come again the pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, they have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 up to 30 euros, agreed the entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
To complete the numbers complication, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) concentrated requests for the week of December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings on the peak days (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon tradition, many employees pay for the party expenses out of their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of affordability, according to the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
A representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be like this month.
“People think twice before they book.
&quot;They want to make ends meet, but when it comes to the topic of prices, they are cautious&quot;, he adds.
Stores will do well for those &quot;who offer quality and good service at a favorable price&quot;, he says, reminding us that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down a notch and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey of various facilities shows that the biggest rush of booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most requests being for spending up to 30 euros, to which they have adjusted the offered menus, the total prices of which are from 25 to 30 euros.
in another important company, which is Andilana, which has 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year&#39;s calendar has brought more early reservations already since the beginning of November.
&quot;We have done both the possible and the impossible to maintain the prices of last year, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros&quot;, they state.
The AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, remains upbeat after seeing an increase in profits from the second half and a fairly solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources of this company emphasize that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
they added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they noticed a tendency of guests to spend 10% more compared to last year in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine - translation note).
They also noted that there are already companies inviting their employees again, and group sizes seem to be slightly larger.
Vice-president of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centers in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes he is starting to see the end of the tunnel, saying bookings have &quot;revived&quot; although clients are &quot;bargaining to the max&quot;.
This impression did not subside even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program has generated great unease in the US
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons &quot;at a faster rate than any other country&quot;.
Wikileaks documents confirm links between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department published by the Wikileaks portal confirms the extraordinary uneasiness that Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program arouses in Washington.
In addition to the illuminating and significant details they offer about the content of the communications and the thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states on nuclear security, rather than increasing, &quot;is on the decline&quot; and that this the unstable Asian country produces &quot;more nuclear weapons than any other nation&quot;.
The peculiarity of Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled but stored in parts to make them difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington&#39;s vigilance.
This is what the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, calculated in a report before the visit of then national security adviser James Jones: &quot;The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials&quot;.
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the guided missile program is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia, as spreading and representing a reason to be on guard.
&quot;Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs,&quot; said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry on meeting with their counterparts from the USA.
The biggest news of the documentation published by Julian Assange&#39;s server is the decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on the topic of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as &quot;frustrating&quot;, claims: &quot;Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance go unanswered or are rejected&quot;.
in another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that &quot;despite economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other country in the world.&quot;
Ambassador Petterson is also asking Washington to &quot;make it very clear&quot; during the visit of army chief General Ashfaq Kayani that &quot;the Pakistani military must end its tacit support for terrorist groups&quot;.
Hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama names top counterterrorism official to avoid new leaks
Interpol issues a &quot;red call&quot; to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced an &quot;extraordinary call&quot;, the so-called red notice, to &quot;locate and track the movement&quot; of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Also, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse allegations an Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the legal representative of Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens assures that &quot;the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange&quot;.
It was on November 20 that the International Police Corps, based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange &quot;with a view to imposing temporary detention on him and extraditing him&quot;.
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person subject to a red notice, many member states, as the organization explained, consider the so-called red notice to allow an arrest to be made - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially if the states have a bilateral agreement on the extradition of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is supposed to be.
The move angered Assenge&#39;s lawyers, who published a memo yesterday saying the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder had shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assenge asked for and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin&#39;s security.
&quot;This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit,&quot; the letter states.
While the whole world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is defending her son&#39;s innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
on Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine - in this interview, he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
&quot;If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations, in violation of international conventions that the United States is a signatory to, she should resign,&quot; he said.
His opinion was dismissed yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,&quot; he told CNN.
Obama himself tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing further leaks of the documents.
The intention of President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views being proclaimed these days by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization &quot;so that we can go after and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide them with assistance &quot;.
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went even further, saying that Assange should &quot;be killed&quot;, which he subsequently had to retract.
&quot;Obama should put a bounty on him or use a drone or something&quot;.
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
&quot;Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient,&quot; he said on Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC by &quot;winking&quot; at supporters of Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to hold a secret ballot on his stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for fighting the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia - trans. note), fruitless due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party leader is aware that his resignation gesture seems inadequate to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot worry about such, such as he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win new critics by winking, which will help him arm himself for the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to vote secretly for him to remain in office.
By ballots, not by a show of hands.
If the supporters of Caroda wish to pass a penal vote on the Chairman, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the split and subjugation of his person.
in several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentages, that it would also not be a good result &quot;according to Bulgaria&quot;.
Caroda&#39;s supporters are demanding more from the president than to make his office available - a gesture they see as carrying no weight since Puigcercós controls the biggest body in the congresses.
But since they don&#39;t have enough of a majority to force resignations, they will try to remind the executive of the plan between now and May.
Because of this, they expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document that the leadership will put to the National Council for a vote on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the latter promising to move the congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that &quot;multiplicity&quot; was damaging to stability and that his goal was for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog seems to be significant.
After taking into account Puigcercós&#39;s ideologue, this innovation consultant took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed &quot;in exchange for several goals&quot;.
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is to &quot;recompose&quot; the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means including new faces who are from the Caroda-friendly sector.
The second target may be a big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC completely do away with meetings as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that it is possible to hold congresses through delegates chosen by vote.
Ending the meeting system model, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercós&#39; team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
However, the convulsive assembly of 2008 decided that the appointment must be considered in a special congress on constitutional reforms.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party discouraged the resolution of this matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, might be a good time to revisit the matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in the month of November; 390 for 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico saw a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders, the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separated bodies in the Valley of Mexico stand out.
in the penultimate month of the year, there were a total of 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases, the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca, stands out.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a mercy wound to the head, and her hands and feet were tied with rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that had been stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early on the morning of Thursday, November 4, cooperative workers discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshot wounds to the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a message signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was shot and killed eight times after leaving his house to pick up trash.
On November 7th, two victims in their 30s were shot to the head in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the district of Ecatepec.
in Chalco, the corpse of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, and a cartridge from a .25 caliber gun was found under the body.
in Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in a sewage canal in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
The emergency services conducted a thorough search for other parts of him, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body with its hands tied behind its back and its head wrapped at the site of Pena Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his head.
in the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bedclothes and left in the trunk of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda, Atizapán de Zaragoza district, was reported, and death threats were also found on the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes district of La Paz.
the rest of the body was found in a nearby colony, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bedclothes in the settlement of Zoquiapan, in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan, a man was found dead, wrapped in a yellow-and-blue sheet, tentatively identified as Mario Ríos, according to the message left by the killers on his body.
in Ixtapaluca, a woman was found lifeless with two wounds to the back of the head in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla.
A tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally &quot;Holy Death&quot; - translation note) was discovered on the woman&#39;s skin, as well as necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, the body of a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a note signed by a criminal group was found in a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found with their heads wrapped in tape and a message was also found with them, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victims had a message written by what was probably one of the criminal organizations saying: &quot;This will happen to those who don&#39;t conform&quot;.
in Ecatepec, two bodies, bearing signs of torture and with their limbs tied, were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the Los Reyes districts of La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one was decapitated and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and had a message left with him; while the other was martyred and was found in a plastic wrap in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents also found a note with a message.
China is sticking to its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
The country&#39;s representative at the COP16 UN climate change conference assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and specified that it is sticking to its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, assured Su Wei, the country&#39;s representative at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country has made immense efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country had already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, he clarified that China will not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on this matter.
He reported that China&#39;s strategy on climate change issues is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and pilot program support.
They have already seen progress on all of these points, including last year&#39;s passage of a new energy law that includes proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further emphasized that in China, federal authorities have worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals of energy conservation, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he said, various multi-year plans are underway or have already been completed, which are financed both by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he said, this is the Program for the efficient use of energy, which has been introduced during the last five years and which has received investments from the United Nations, the government and private initiatives.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, as well as a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving light bulbs and a mitigation and adaptation project, he specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country&#39;s expert adviser on climate change, assured that China&#39;s efforts were greater than widely believed.
For example, he recounted, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are 6 tons, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for a 9% historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Expulsion of Espino enacted: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - translation note) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to demand his right from the National Order Commission.
The National President of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos has been enacted, and that the former president of this party is entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and demand his right.
in an interview that was taken before the objection was raised by state governor Gabin Cué Monteagudo, he said that the expulsion of Espino was in any case a decision taken at the local level.
“This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission of Sonora.
&quot;Mr. Espino has the right to turn in his case through a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council so that it is a decision made by a competent authority&quot;, he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she was never at the negotiating table for the alliance&#39;s presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge strengthened from the internal elections held next December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
&quot;This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a plan for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose&quot;, he pointed out.
The chairman of PAN said that 71 years of dialogue are behind him, and therefore &quot;we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and it strengthens us&quot;, he added.
He said that the committee can without debates choose the best chairman or chairman that PAN deserves for the next three years, so he will pass the baton to &quot;whomever the committee appoints&quot;.
&quot;So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five&quot;.
He predicted that the party&#39;s surge in the last election in July would be reflected in future races, although &quot;it is not yet time to think about 2012&quot;.
&quot;Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task&quot;.
in this context, he emphasized that these three governments, rooted in the alliances of Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be the object of observation throughout the country, since &quot;many expectations and desires are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino to these lives up to expectations&quot;.
When asked about the PRI&#39;s (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speeches during his four years in power, César Nava urged PRI members to think about six-year terms former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
&quot;If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderón, then let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell&quot;, he testified.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during the speech at the National Auditorium because there is no gagging or censorship in this country.
Obama touts bill to support undocumented students on Twitter
&quot;If you believe that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and urge them to pass this law,&quot; the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize undocumented students, with a post on his personal Twitter account today.
&quot;If you believe that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and urge them to pass this bill,&quot; Obama tweeted.
His brief notes an Internet link to a more comprehensive document that asks the public to contact senators immediately as a vote on the bill nears.
&quot;With the vote expected to take place soon, now is the time to have your say,&quot; he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any legislation unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a block, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect votes on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new nuclear non-proliferation treaty with Russia, called START.
When asked about Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be put together.
&quot;I believe there is still plenty of time left...&quot;
&quot;We all agree that we must resolve the tax matter before the end of the year...&quot;
I believe we can reach an agreement on this matter at some point and then we can plan the order of other matters&quot;, he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will request a &quot;close vote&quot; on the Dream Act, so the bill to legalize undocumented students could come up for a Senate vote as early as next Thursday, though next week is more likely.
Senate approval of the Dream Act, or &quot;American Dream&quot; law, would legalize roughly 800,000 young people who came to the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country within the last five years and were accepted into an institution of higher education or into the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, so they need the help of several Republicans, so his supporters&#39; organizations are campaigning hard to get the bill passed.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
That&#39;s why supporters of the Dream Act need to win over some Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are negotiating the most are Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as outgoing Florida Sen. George Lemieux, who filled the seat of Sen. Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it again.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet commented at this time.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face its biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature they put a finger in the wound (&quot;poner el dedo en la llaga&quot;, translated &quot;to put a finger in the wound&quot; is similar to Czech &quot;to hit the nail on the head - note translation)
The second round of the Pleasure of Language cycle was a promenade where the participants presented a literary gala performance
&quot;I understand that with Sex in the Language, but... A finger in the wound? What is expected of me?&quot; asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was invited to launch the second round of Pleasures of Language, a series that celebrates literature written in Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair they had a round table on the topic of Sex in Language, she explained).
The finger in the wound &quot;brings us into a tight spot,&quot; the Argentinian writer said sweetly to an audience of mostly young people gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear this roundtable debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and featuring Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read the text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celoria, which Schultz later described as a great short story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as the protagonist, who, in search of knowledge of what the &quot;wound&quot; is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not receive answer though the stop of the same story yes.
She leaves the infectious disease specialist convinced: &quot;patience is not my strong point, maybe it will be my wound&quot;.
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist, who took her breath away mid-way but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: &quot;the wound represents the truly open, and the symbolic one is the scar&quot;.
The protagonist heaved a sigh of relief and came to the conclusion that &quot;the only thing she managed to learn about the wound was that it was really open and that it didn&#39;t exist&quot;, but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuela played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also came up with a delightful narrative he called In Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named but appears at one point.
with elements of magical realism tells of a famous witch who played with the clouds, brought back people who had gone far away, or restored the honor lost by a maiden, this narrative, which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which they were not absent from the beginning his own chroniclers who narrated it, and Bernal Díaz del Castillo is quoted here criticizing the exaggeration in the accounts of the conquering captains.
&quot;Cervantes, who invented us all (writers), mocked the fake testimonies that were presented as real in the stories, but in no other way did he ever manage to tell the story of America with such imagery that lacked even shame&quot;.
However, he emphasized, &quot;it&#39;s the fools and the liars who have more imagination&quot; and it&#39;s where fact and lie merge, where you no longer know what belongs to one group and what belongs to another, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls this the &quot;Cervant tradition&quot;.
&quot;Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have.&quot;
Subsequently, Mayra Monterová emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations made possible by the invitation of the International Book Fair with her talk Finger in the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer pointed the finger at the great scourge of social violence that runs through her country - and is shared by Latin America - as a result of trade disputes and drug sales.
&quot;I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise, which of course is not intended,&quot; she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the readers - and in their &quot; chemical reaction&quot;.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized &quot;this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer&quot;.
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which overflows with dogmatisms, it is forgotten that &quot;behind every assent there is a small no and behind every denial there is also a small yes&quot;.
&quot;In order to be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and to color means many times to put a finger in the wound and harass those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also harass the authorities who prefer this black and white world&quot;, he uttered to support the meaning of the writing.
Romano is going for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced both good and bad during his career, but he has already managed to reach the deciding series on three occasions.
in the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, two different styles characterized by their techniques will meet, teams that have a noticeable difference in results between them.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has come away with no achievements, which is why this chance for him is extraordinary.
The Argentine had to settle for the silver medal, staying one step behind the winners and curiously playing with the same team in the following final.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura tournament in charge of Morelia, losing 4-2 on aggregate against Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament, he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna club in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario tournament, again against the &quot;Devils&quot; from Toluca, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the &quot;Uzenářs&quot; (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note transl.) after 210 minutes of the game tied 2 -2, he went into a three-on-one advantage after a series of free throws and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed from 11 steps and the team suffered a turnover at 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the &quot;Red Devils&quot; from Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that for him the most important thing is the institution.
&quot;I want to come out as a winner, I don&#39;t want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I owe, and of course the title would also be for me, but the first is the most important&quot;, expressed the coach when asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
he has a vivid memory of the previous final, in which, he confirms, he learned a lot, &quot;we learned a lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we are already they were ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we learned from that, until the game is over, we can&#39;t celebrate&quot;.
He is not worried that this series could be decided in penalty kicks, he trusts his players: &quot;You never try to go to a penalty shootout, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you have to be ready for that, in the past we were ready for the tournament, but unfortunately fate dealt us a bad turn, maybe because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and let&#39;s hope that this time something like that won&#39;t happen&quot; .
Romano has in his hands the chance to stop being second and get his first taste of the glory that comes with the titles.
The United States is changing its visa rules
People will need to contact the Visa Applicant Services centers before the interview at the Consular Section; costs will be lower and waiting times will be reduced.
Effective January 10, 2011, the visa processing process at United States Embassies and Consulates will change.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact Visa Applicant Services centers (abbreviated from English ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
ASC personnel will collect the applicant&#39;s biometric information and it will be evaluated by the Consular Department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including:
The total cost of processing a visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay a fee for arranging an appointment, another for processing the application and another for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant pays only one fee that covers all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa-on-application cases (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for a business and investor visa.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to go through an interview with a consular officer, but just go to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and be fingerprinted.
As biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants requiring a second interview appointment at the Consular Section will spend less time there than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra $26 service fee.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency has called a press conference for tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When inviting journalists, NASA assured that it would present &quot;a discovery that will cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life&quot;, which raised speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could support the theory that there are other creatures besides us living in inhospitable conditions that were thought to be uninhabitable, and that could represent the possibility of one day becoming intelligent creatures like humans if conditions improve. in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that makes it more likely that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere of Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that &quot;there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know&quot;.
The space agency will announce the true extent of the discoveries at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conradová, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn&#39;s largest moon) with the perspective that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón spawn opposition &quot;bloc&quot;
Reforms to the Constitution Act on Congress are ushering in &quot;bipartisanship,&quot; they claim.
The 60th parliamentary term had not yet begun when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by members of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech &quot;Party of the Democratic Revolution&quot; - note transl.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech &quot;Work Party &quot; - note trans.), Convergencia (Czech &quot;Shoda&quot; note trans.) and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself an independent, and these four discussed one thing: the arrival of &quot;bipartism&quot; in the House.
Before the start of the session to open the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergencia party, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo &quot;thundered&quot; against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, &quot;Bapartism&quot; begins, because now it will be two persons from the same number of parties who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilarova, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit of the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech &quot;National Action Party&quot; - note trans.) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally form political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech &quot;Revolutionary Institutional Party&quot;) and PAN parties.
He specified that they would talk to PAN and PRI representatives in the coming days to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they did not have it, they would again be subjected to the two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
&quot;When it (the opposition coalition) got here, that&#39;s how I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others&quot;.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from the Convergencia party said that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patrón and will therefore form a plurality group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that the Congress, after being a monopoly, should now be a &quot;duopole.&quot;
The aspiration of law reform is not for endless bipartisanship in Congress.
This group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT party explained that currently Congress has become &quot;prey&quot; of two - referring to the PAN and PRI parties.
&quot;It used to be controlled by only one party, today it is shared by two.&quot;
Patrón Montalvo asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
&quot;So that the five deputies, who will probably already be nine, but right now they see us as five, are not left out due to arch agreements, each in a different faction, we united to find a place at the negotiating table, since the problem is that in the reform, which they created and agreed to, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform&quot;.
An additional 200 thousand pesos is issued for the &quot;supplier&quot;
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company in question.
Another check for slightly more than 200 thousand pesos was sent by the city hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
This brings the amount paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying electrical equipment to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to City Hall&#39;s transparency page, this latest check, number 9258447, was sent on November 16 of this year, was issued in the amount of 200,144.56 pesos, and stated as its subject &quot;settlement of outstanding payments.&quot;
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay another amount to this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices.
What hasn&#39;t been said is the total amount City Hall still owes her and how many more checks will be sent to Camacho Palazuelos.
&quot;Nothing has been purchased now, we are only paying her what we owe her, as well as other suppliers,&quot; he said in an interview.
The last checks &quot;reappeared&quot; in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last one on November 16.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies inspected by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative bodies, the treasurer assured that she has not used the services of the City Hall supplier again.
previously, after July 25, the Noroeste newspaper published an audit of checks issued by the city hall to its contractors, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city paid the Camachos Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places are in dire need of maintenance
Tourism managers complain about the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada Gazebo in Mazatlán in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist.
After a foreign tourist fell into a sinkhole at the gazebo of Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlán is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Zona Dorada area, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the impression of the destination be taken care of, and that the bad that tourists find here be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
&quot;Politicians don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to close a business for a day, and they don&#39;t have an idea of the lost revenue, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be dealing with these issues for so long and without proper planning&quot;.
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist&#39;s fall was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city hall.
&quot;The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to take care of preventive maintenance, not just repair existing defects&quot;, he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because maintenance should be done not only because we are a tourist area, but also as residents we deserve a clean place to live, the town hall should change its city maintenance strategy&quot;.
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as Mazatlán&#39;s Emblem and El Venadito.
&quot;Nowadays, in order for tourists to come, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city abounding in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out&quot;, he said.
&quot;It has not been given the attention it needs and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
Talking about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to make it attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of the Tourism Department, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not being used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, but it will first need to be put in order to make these places attractive and to be able to include them in the list we have to promote this destination&quot;.
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like the MPs to take a big responsibility by leading by example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges the state is facing.
A parliamentary period full of dignified work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanded by the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is in convulsions and faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has started, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they can implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that they will not repeat the same partisan and paternalistic patrons.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great responsibility and lead by example in the way of a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
&quot;We expect MPs to really exercise their right, without agreements between parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions&quot;.
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that would move the ruling forward in order.
&quot;We want them to do a decent job and above all to be committed to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them confidence with their vote in the last election&quot;.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives will be to gather all their strength to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support the creation of jobs&quot;.
Regarding tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
&quot;I learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate considering that it is an important economic activity, bringing in foreign exchange and investment, which also directly competes with agriculture&quot;.
In addition to releasing funds for startup tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with certainty and help with the liquor law, which failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary terms.
The Three Kings are wanted
Dolls, toy cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the children&#39;s wish list in the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their dreams this coming Epiphany, as their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they desire so much.
The family lives in a modest home in Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
&quot;Sometimes we have a hard time because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the &quot;plebeians&quot; to sell on the street,&quot; said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the children&#39;s mother.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he has been wanting a &quot;monster&quot; car for some time, and for his eight-month-old little brother Jesús, Cayetana would like one-year-old clothes.
&quot;He (José Alfredo) told me &#39;I would like this monster car&#39;, but I told him &#39;we&#39;ll see my son&#39; because it was very expensive&quot;, recalls Cayetana with sadness.
For older children who were just at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11, is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so a pair of size five and a half or size six would be great.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign &quot;Looking for the Three Kings&quot; and bring a gift or cash to the reception of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
Dozens of searches were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people were arrested and face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places that were used for the production of drugs.
&quot;Approximately 750 beds of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized,&quot; said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Arrested persons had to appear at the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice following their arrest.
They could face charges of manufacturing cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These searches followed a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
&quot;It was information we received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests,&quot; said M. Ruel.
This police operation involved 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Unit of Estrie, the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphrémagog Police Department.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
A Tory bill that the government says should regulate the problem of boats loaded with illegal immigrants is set to be defeated, with all three opposition parties saying on Wednesday they could not support it.
“I rely heavily on the Charter.
&quot;I stand squarely on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet&quot;, declared the leader of the Liberals Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly meeting of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as drafted, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, would violate Canada&#39;s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong goal.
&quot;We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do&quot;, said M. Duceppe.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has dismissed critics who say her party is not strong enough on illegal immigrants.
&quot;The New Democrats agree that we will take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we see as the backbone of another bill, C-35,&quot; Ms. Chow said.
&quot;We don&#39;t support the Conservative bill because it puts the blame on refugees and puts children in jail for at least a year,&quot; Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney blamed opposition parties.
&quot;Canadians are telling MPs en masse that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat it like some kind of sycophant.&quot;
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not called a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election to reject it.
One Conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote to make every MP who opposes answer to their constituents for their position.
The new unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigative commission for the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is trying to ensure that this idea does not fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation from New York on this issue as early as next January.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit available since 1870.
That&#39;s why Tuesday&#39;s announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on October 29 last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
It didn&#39;t take much for public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron of the PQ to call the announcement a &quot;rabbit out of a hat&quot; and a &quot;knee-jerk amateur solution&quot;.
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
“They will settle for confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it.
“We are aware of this issue.
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of the examination of witnesses at a public trial.
&quot;In addition, Mr. Charest is adamant that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, as you and I do, that he is hiding something,&quot; he explains.
&quot;The only way to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest&quot;, explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Civil Servants.
To break this impasse, he suggested Quebec grant special powers to the inspector general to investigate collusion and corruption.
&quot;We must be able to expand the mandate of the Inspector General&quot;, he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, which allows him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent task force is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also follow Ottawa to change the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request would come from the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the jurisprudence for this type of investigation is not explicit.
The federal public safety minister, Vic Toews, confirmed that his justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, was currently considering some of the amendments linked to the dossier.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had changes made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to the heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
A landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
Several regions were hit by heavy rainfall from Tuesday to Wednesday evening, i.e. between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters were not expected between today and Thursday evening, according to the regions.
Sections north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the hardest hit.
A total of up to 100 millimeters could fall there.
If we add up these precipitations with the melting of the snow accumulated in some sectors, we can fear floods in some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning Wednesday evening for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in les Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became subject to flood alert and continuous control.
In the de Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused the flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, one temporary bridge was pulled down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In the Outaouais, the overflowing of some lakes caused the closure of some roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Emergency services are on standby and monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security consultant.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Center issued severe flood warnings on Wednesday for several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (RRTV) over controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians and, as well as abusive language during the broadcast.
The Broadcasting Council ruled that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the statements contained &quot;inaccurate information about social assistance and an inappropriate negative portrayal of Haitians, crude language that does not correspond to a broadcast broadcast during the day &quot;.
The board also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the broadcast of the names of the two people who took their own lives, did not breach broadcasting regulations.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Common Front of Quebec social assistance recipients.
The group complained that the amounts given in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not misleading.
Regarding the suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that the suicide was a gesture of desperation.
The majority of the Commission members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide could not be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
&quot;The majority of the Commission believes that the disputed episodes of the ``Dupont Noon News&#39;&#39; broadcasts dealt with a sensitive subject in an impartial and appropriate manner.&quot;
There was no charge against him.
The latest controversy involved statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort got into a media shootout that caused many reactions.
The CHOI moderator stated that he did not send any donation to help the Haitians because we cannot know for sure that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission believes that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative image of Haitians.
“I&#39;ve already made up for my three-day delay on that thing.
&quot;My file has been untouched for a year and a half,&quot; said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use abusive language in broadcasts.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated &quot;beyond the scope of its duties&quot;.
For the station, which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
The kung fu king of Montreal.
Montreal resident, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special streak.
An athlete who excels in &quot;sanda&quot; (kung fu &quot;full contact&quot;), in kickboxing and Thai boxing, he enters the tatami and rings all over the world and looks for new challenges.
&quot;I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.&quot;
&quot;In my case, I&#39;m kind of looking everywhere for fights, because for those who don&#39;t like the ground game that comes with combat sports, competitions in North America are rare.
Recently, the UPS security guard and helper just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh. in Scotland.
“I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories, he stated.
“I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup.
&quot;Competitors who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited.&quot;
“I won bronze in Toronto in 2009.
“I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005.
&quot;In 2007 in China I finished fifth in the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third,&quot; he added.
“What&#39;s interesting is that I&#39;ve made some progress in every competition.
&quot;At this rate, I&#39;ll be first this year or next year!&quot;
&quot;san shou&quot; or &quot;sanda&quot; is a discipline originating in China, where punches and kicks, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches traditionally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer, born from this form of fighting, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal has only one result to keep in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the super tournament &quot;King of Sanda&quot;, the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
&quot;This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,&quot; explains the nice guy.
&quot;It&#39;s kind of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand).&quot;
“It was a great experience.
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
“The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed.
&quot;There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg).&quot;
&quot;The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the final of their category.&quot;
&quot;Then the winners of each category will compete so that a single champion, the King of Kung Fu, can be crowned.&quot;
450 million contracted without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed, by mutual agreement, to 450 million in contracts with engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is precisely the consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, the contract to manage the entire project in the total amount of 295 million dollars without a public tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was authorized in 2004, concurrently with the selection of Hydro-Québec, to hand over to the private sector its responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the &quot;Énergie gérance&quot; consortium won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies presents a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and provoking price increases.
&quot;It&#39;s a new way to implement collusion and eliminate competition.&quot;
&quot;This means that people no longer make side deals in secret, today they make them openly,&quot; said PQ deputy Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly, because he says that he finds it hard to see how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected in the afternoon, strongly denying that this contract involved collusion.
&quot;I have my own way&quot;, she thundered, claiming the PQ was &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;lacking precision&quot;.
She said &quot;it would be the least thing&quot; for the PQ to apologise.
The recipe for the formation of a consortium is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex considering the scope of the works.
Construction is already underway and must be laid out by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition being able to negotiate; it was a business.
It must also be admitted that the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortia formula for engineering consultancy is the subject of a government investigation.
A quick scan of Quebec&#39;s business register reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; name CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau highlighted the fact that &quot;the territory of la Baie James is typical of a particular labor force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s&quot;.
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will make us frown at the fact that the project management contract was entered into by mutual agreement.
&quot;If you go to a public tender and there are few bidders, your bid prices may be higher.&quot;
&quot;You have two options to choose from: that is, that you take the people who figure in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say: &quot;Let&#39;s make a satisfactory deal with a good price.&quot;
&quot;But the main idea is that it is not the price that is important, but the competence of the people&quot;, affirmed Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their subsidiaries, especially with laboratories performing analyzes of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin raked in 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in &quot;Énergie gérance&quot;.
All contracts have been concluded.
They total $449,783,344, including the Énergie gérance contract for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four firms that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are &quot;very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec&quot;.
Minister Normandeau dropped the message that the PQ is also linked to firms that &quot;finance&quot; it, before specifying that they are more likely to be its executives.
The barometer of responsible consumption - the &quot;green&quot; label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little trust in the actors of sustainable development, but also in &quot;impartial&quot; brands and ecological certifications, to be guided accordingly when choosing products.
The worst thing is that even if we bathe in a media universe that urges us and encourages us to consume more socially responsible, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfill obligations that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, according to the Baromètre of responsible consumption, the first article of which was published yesterday.
Even though the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still do not trust them very much
In fact, two-thirds of us say they don&#39;t trust companies&#39; environmental promises simply because of the companies&#39; green advertising, finds a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke&#39;s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certifications attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that describe themselves as environmentally responsible, Barometre reports.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount to stimulate this side of consumption, currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the population of Quebec distrusts the reported data about the products or &quot;green&quot; services that we are looking to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits, and especially to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them preferred to shop at merchants in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, according to Baromètre.
More &quot;green&quot; and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year -, Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which strives to have the least possible impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, reports Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they use public transport or that they recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in the interests of nature conservation.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The government of Quebec, which we asked for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company &quot;Angus et le Parallèle&quot;, which sought a donation of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinematographic complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a lover of the art of cinema, did not get what it asked for.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the dossier, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebec government is proposing a loan, the amount of which would be lower than originally expected, which could lay the foundation for a viable solution under favorable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and request for 12.8 million was already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised for reductions.
The proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematography project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government&#39;s counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Owners of Cinemas and Cinematography Centers of Quebec opposed direct investment by the state to support the buyout of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project when he did not do it for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion, on the contrary, demanded essential economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, brought film art into his cinema premises over ten years after he financed the construction of the complex himself, which may have been the reason for the change by the State Finance Board.
The lack of theaters for independent films is glaring in Montréal, and eXcentris has been able to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is leading a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will raise $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
As of spring 2009, only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen all three theaters on February 27 next year and screen Xavier Beauvois&#39;s most beautiful film, Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir and so ignores himself, he and his group think about the reduction proposals that are made to him.
A curtain raised on Canada as a whole...
New US diplomatic sources released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States sees as an inferiority complex of Canadians vis-à-vis Americans, but with the same blow betrays its sense of the latter&#39;s superiority over Canada.
American diplomats are therefore amazed that Canadian-American relations are on the heart of every Canadian voter when they go to the polls, and believe that President Obama&#39;s visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new reports between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, released yesterday for public viewing, also provide sensitive details to get under each other&#39;s skin.
The memo, dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the election campaign, details the extent to which the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
Much to the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
&quot;Canada&#39;s inferiority complex, almost ingrained, perhaps conditions political leaders to talk about internal stakes instead of realizing that this election is about the United States as well (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),&quot; he writes.
&quot;So the United States,&quot; he concluded, &quot;is the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to talk about.&quot;
The ambassador understands this &quot;deafening silence&quot; even less because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
&quot;It stands to reason that the ability of a candidate, party, or even better party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor on voters&#39; minds when they go to the polls.&quot;
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in a message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d&#39;affaires à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
&quot;Your trip will help ensure the government is kept in place in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, which will see Canada publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30-40 billion recovery plan,&quot; Breese writes.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties depend on the quality of the proposed recovery plan for their survival.
Another report, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington&#39;s attention to the increasingly negative image cast on the United States by CBC drama series.
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe not very subtle references to Maher Arar, the &quot;No-Fly-List&quot; or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, &quot;he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State.&quot;
&quot;The secretary accepted with the understanding that she will revise the file&quot;.
Finally, let&#39;s note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC airwaves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be &quot;destroyed&quot;.
It got out and even Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World Plan for Lighting Restoration
Yesterday in Cancun, the United Nations proposed a plan to restore home, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with the goal of reducing the greenhouse effect (GES), equivalent to almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the planet&#39;s climate between now and 2020 ..
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to promote in Cancun to compensate for the absence of hard-to-realize reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, with compact fluorescent light bulbs or, even better, light emitting diode (DEL or &quot;LED&quot; in English) light bulbs, a substantial amount of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt ) GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would break down.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the entire planet&#39;s car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GHG emissions to drop from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But another 5 Gt will have to be subtracted from this balance in order to stabilize climate warming at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 so that it can be ruled out that it does not get out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluorescent compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with new bulbs with DEL, we will reduce this consumption by two more.
Fluorocompact bulbs last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New DEL bulbs, such as those put into production this week by Philips - the company is said to have participated in the UN study - have an expected lifespan of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving us an idea of the potential savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about CFLs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection facilities.
However, as the report notes, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent light bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants, which emit much of the mercury needed to generate electricity wasted in red-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centers release 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the gains that each country would make from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would thus save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has demanded the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast after the expiry of the set deadlines.
&quot;The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results without delay, the spokesperson of the UN President stressed.&quot;
&quot;It asks all parties in Côte d&#39;Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.&quot;
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission let the latest date - midnight on Wednesday - pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday&#39;s scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission &quot;continues to work&quot; to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls grew worldwide for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara.
But Gbagbo&#39;s camp is counting on the Constitutional Council to annul the &quot;fraudulent&quot; vote in the north, which has been run by former New Army (FN) rebels since a failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N&#39;Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, confirmed that voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged supporters of the Ivorian president from going to the polls.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country&#39;s highest court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N&#39;Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any links to the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and asked Gbagbo to respect them but not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of presidential elections, taking place on Sunday, was seen as the crowning achievement of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned an Ivory Coast political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on October 31, as the winner with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
France&#39;s unemployment rate as defined by the International Labor Office (BIT) remained steady at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), according to seasonally adjusted provisional (CVS) data released on Thursday INSEE.
The number of unemployed has stabilized at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The data from the second quarter was confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they they search or they don&#39;t search.
The situation of today&#39;s young people on the labor market has further escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labor Office, 637,000 young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed.
As for the elderly, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, the same as in the year), that is, 482,000 people aged 50 and over and 6.6 % including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 benefited from the stability of unemployment at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union&#39;s statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday reported a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after it was 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and put in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of the waste treatment companies and brother of the PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône Administrative Council, was accused and imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public contracts, allegedly fraudulent obtained.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misappropriation of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, giving bribes, accepting bribes to influence office and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
&quot;Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions that he intends to ask him, and not some delusions.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s easy to prosecute him for many criminal reasons, but it&#39;s another thing to prove them,&quot; his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client&#39;s hearing.
Mr. Guérini said through his lawyers that he sent a brief message to the judge before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his close associates, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
Regarding the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of anything like that, Mr. Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former general director of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for misuse of public funds and conspiracy, leaving the protagonists of the affair free, under judicial supervision with a ban on contact.
&quot;My client was able to provide an explanation for all the facts that are accused of him.&quot;
&quot;The investigating judge is looking into this and will let him go free,&quot; said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released Tuesday night, with two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager with elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption&quot;.
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for &quot;theft and misuse of company property&quot;, the other for &quot;conspiracy to misuse public funds&quot;.
Finally, Alexandra Guérini&#39;s business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with &quot;concealing the misuse of company assets&quot;.
Among those who have been confronted by Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of helping to launder money from large-scale gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted as part of several open judicial inquiries against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the awarding of public contracts, particularly in the matter of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some towns of the Municipal Community of Marseille (MPM).
The case of Clotilde Reiss: The Elysee Palace exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for &quot;espionage&quot;, united opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the downsides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of trippers).
They show how senior French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by US justice for nefarious trafficking of material for the benefit of Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
Finally, they bring to light the manner in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
He didn&#39;t really do anything for it.
A diplomatic cable written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled: &quot;Iran: French comments on how to deal with the hostage situation&quot;.
Elysee Palace Strategic Affairs Adviser, François Richier, accompanied by Quai d&#39;Orsay Director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with US diplomat Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
&quot;Make noise&quot;, they say, &quot;continually emphatically pronounce&quot; in the media the words &quot;fundamental human rights&quot;, &quot;innocence&quot;, &quot;immediate release&quot;.
An image-sensitive Iranian regime needs to be embarrassed.
&quot;Do it more the more they ask you to stop&quot;.
As there have been attempts to negotiate through discreet channels, &quot;silence will not solve anything&quot;, the Iranians are &quot;masters of evasive maneuvers&quot;.
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is &quot;an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purpose of &quot;political blackmail&quot;.
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she will be granted refuge by the French embassy) &quot;will require the payment of a large financial sum to the Iranians&quot; (a bail of 230,000 euros).
And he announces that the Elysee Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that &quot;will intensify&quot;.
The Iranians &quot;could arrest another 1,800 or so French people living in Iran in the future,&quot; he says.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but she still remains blocked in Iran.
Word is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States says was deported for illegally trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is set free in Paris following a judge&#39;s decision.
The US embassy, like many observers, is questioning this troubling coincidence.
Majid Khakavand&#39;s expansion is bad news for Washington, which is pursuing Iran&#39;s illicit networks for obtaining material destined for its nuclear program.
Did France start bargaining?
The release of an Iranian for the release of a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, was not only &quot;surprised by this decision of the judge&quot;, but was looking for a way to oppose it.
&quot;There were talks between the presidency and the minister of justice&quot; (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but &quot;the French government cannot change the court&#39;s decision&quot;, he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under &quot;limited&quot; surveillance by French intelligence.
An Elysée Palace aide dials a telephone number, hangs up the phone, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy&quot;.
At the time of Clotilda Reiss&#39;s imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiques and organized &quot;leaks&quot; to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing a &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;influential&quot; role as a &quot;mediator&quot;.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of August 25, 2009 evokes the media &quot;blitz&quot; of French officials&quot;.
What is the basis for such a degree of &quot;gratitude&quot; expressed towards M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
&quot;Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately admit they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done&quot;.
The documentary then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication &quot;is aimed at validating President Sarkozy&#39;s policy of opening up to Syria&quot;, he analysed.
The policy implemented in 2008 &quot;was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labeled as premature and undeserved&quot;.
By &quot;exaggerating Syria&#39;s role&quot;, Paris is trying to &quot;demonstrate to Syria what accolades it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region&quot;.
The aim is also to &quot;sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran&quot;.
The US Embassy knows this from a very good source.
August 11, François Richier confided to him: &quot;of course we don&#39;t know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is&quot;
“But we thanked them anyway.
&quot;This should, at the very least, create confusion and confusion among Iranians&quot;.
Clotilda Reiss is returning to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee Palace.
In the communique, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their &quot;active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot&quot;.
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
South Korea&#39;s government will pass a so-called &quot;Peculiar&quot; law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to those games after midnight to those under 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
&quot;Many children play these games all night and then have problems learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day.&quot;
&quot;We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,&quot; Jo Rin, a senior official at the ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be accessible again from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also anticipates asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for youngsters whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who ask for it free programs to limit the time they spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most &quot;affected&quot; countries, and the daily press regularly reports various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa appoints host countries.
Ridden by turmoil over suspected corruption, Fifa&#39;s executive committee will appoint the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups on Thursday, a supremely politically motivated selection where influence wrangling and lobbying risk overtaking technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 Fifa royal competition will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The championship in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to plant in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of a measure of the economic and political stakes of the entire world.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations run the risk of lasting until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fifa&#39;s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) dossiers have the best arguments, as well as those of their competitors.
But those reasons won&#39;t carry much weight with the 22 members of the executive committee in the hour designated for voting.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelations, leading to the suspension of two members of the CE /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have ruined the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has so far only hosted the World Cup once a year.
The BBC put the crown on it on Monday when it aired a documentary that &quot;pinned&quot; three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to displease Fifa and embarrass England&#39;s top brass with David Cameron in the forefront.
The prime minister is hoping to repeat the move made by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to get London to host the 2012 Olympic Games.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal does not lack the trumps of already prepared stadiums, its blessings (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games 1992 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial outlook for both countries could give those ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided that the championships would not be moved to Zurich and publicly declared &quot;unfair competition in the preparation of the vote&quot;, in barely twisted allusions to the accusations of the English press against CE (European Commission) members.
&quot;We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them&quot;, declared Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, with its considerable experience from 1994, appears to be the logical favorite.
The highest performing economy in the world, the home of Fifa&#39;s main sponsors, this country seems to be well ahead of Japan and South Korea, who, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem to be premature for both countries, which went through a &quot;trial&quot; together in 2002.
Another threat: awarding the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa desperately wants, has made Asia&#39;s chances for 2022 null and void.
With Qatar pulling a big ace up its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new territories, but these two countries represent more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pounce on the paltry TV fees (due to time-shift) paid by European countries, the driving force behind Fifa.
Second mandate: obviousness (certainty)
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand gave the appearance of hesitation.
Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious does not sit well with the share of mystery associated with the presidency.
So it is necessary to act as if the doubts persisted all the time.
In one sense and in the other.
In 2006, without wanting to believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac made claims that a third mandate would not be ruled out.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that &quot;he will decide sometime in the fall of 2011&quot;.
As he reminded members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of &quot;two mandates&quot; sowed a slightly feverish state.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn&#39;t far from it.
The President only reminded that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he reminds us of the presidential election in such meetings with a humorous tone.
&quot;At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,&quot; he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: &quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m not thinking about the next stage.&quot;
His statements the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate any more than the day before; it doesn&#39;t make him any less of a candidate.
If they provoke comments, it is because of a double truth.
Accelerating the path to candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entrance to Ségolène Royal&#39;s rink that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convict.
It is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want the formation into battle formations rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to the candidacy of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L&#39;Express).
&quot;We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP&quot;, people from the prime minister&#39;s immediate environment responded immediately and cautiously.
&quot;If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run&quot;, says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
&quot;He will still believe he can win&quot;, corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council of the year should have been an opportunity to specify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is binding, the institute for issuing securities will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the already tense situation on the European securities markets.
The political price would be all the higher in that case.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in favor of solving the debt crisis of European countries.
She declined to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, such as increasing its sovereign bond-buying program.
&quot;I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)&quot;.
The evening before, in Brussels, during his questioning by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent about his intentions, contenting himself with saying that the program to buy government securities on the secondary market &quot;continues&quot; and that &quot;we will see how we decide&quot; during the meeting that takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of treasury bonds by the European Central Bank doubled in the last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of market players, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have bought €67 billion since May 2010.
Anticipation of continued buying leaves no room for doubt among market players (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in the rate.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter bank approaches the unlimited provision of liquid funds under generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine she would change her program in any significant way.&quot;
&quot;If not, it would mean accepting the risk of causing short-term new tensions,&quot; says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
&quot;The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely&quot;, anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds to the plan of its interventions on the public debt market, &quot;the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of its bond purchases to revive the sluggish market&quot;.
With regard to the exposures of European banks in the Eurozone sovereign debt markets, it has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
&quot;It needs to make up for the lack of investors on the market at all costs and to act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performances by the states, which are among the most fragile&quot;, testified yesterday a prominent bond manager.
Because if interest rates soar, countries will struggle all the more to reduce their debt instead of stabilizing it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is hunching its back
After a worrisome start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit, yesterday with a reverse flow of 10-year bond yields.
A return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the regions said that they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as &quot;intractable&quot; and that he expected an &quot;unpredictable&quot; weekend, which the participants then denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest rates hit a record 210 basis points and the price of CDS contracts soared as high as 263 points, causing some consternation in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was &quot;too busy&quot; with &quot;turbulent market developments&quot; and a possible contagion from Ireland.
&quot;The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.&quot;
&quot;The bad news is that it&#39;s like Portugal,&quot; explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Plain and simple, its problem is the absence of growth and lackluster fiscal inputs, which go hand in hand and put the state at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the deficit of public finances will still represent 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% assumed by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new summary of amendments to the state budget proposal, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
&quot;If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken&quot;, assesses the commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy accepts support from international institutions.
&quot;The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time&quot;, assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
&quot;There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required of other countries&quot;, notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, elections could begin to be organized, which are expected to be held at the end of March.
This would begin a period not suitable for making decisions in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde emphasized this again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: &quot;I think the Europeans demonstrated this throughout the day and night on Sunday, they are obviously very solidly determined, committed to defend their currency and their currency zone.&quot;
Although everything is relative, yesterday&#39;s recorded expansion regarding interest rates on European government bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the European Central Bank.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s has announced that it could downgrade Portugal&#39;s debt record, the target most focused on by various speculations.
&quot;Because in May the real policy is insufficiently transparent and obvious, mainly based on banking systems&quot;, according to Exane BNP Paribas economists.
All the more so because &quot;political time runs slower than market time&quot;.
Aware of this broken connection and the danger it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers most affected by the issue, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
And this with regard to the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and the Ecofin grouping from the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank is meeting today.
On the agenda is the fate of non-conventional measures to support eurozone countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Fund (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, denied a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of this trip is not to raise funds, it certainly sets the stage for achieving that goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilized funds through additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, especially as regards the organization of the labor market.
Reforms that join strict measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid took a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before they have implemented their own fiscal adjustments and decided on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of sovereign bond markets.
During his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to tap into the stock of securities again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the very first trade plan with European sovereign claims, believe that an addition of approximately 100 billion euros would be enough, &quot;preferably&quot; in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized to date with 60 billion euros.
Advice that has every chance to be tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange alert.
The snow rations are still causing traffic difficulties, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
L&#39;Eure, l&#39;Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne joined the 20 districts already on orange alert, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night .
According to Météo France, significant snow flurries are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes, with light snow in Ile-de-France.
A snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and a cover of 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d&#39;Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snow flurries are big enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the Côtes d&#39;Armor coast, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to the police, the road traffic on the second class roads in Brittany is very difficult and the police advise you to go out with your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the traffic of some trucks has been canceled for the day.
School services were banned in Picardy for Thursday.
No special measures are expected to restrict freight traffic on Wednesday evening.
The district office &quot;calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt their driving to the nature of the road&quot;.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to expected snow flurries.
DGAC advises passengers using air transport services to contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Billions have been raining down since the debate on modernizing transport in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this building to be launched, the state announced the provision of a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
Purely in theory, this is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first amendments.
The Finance Amendment Bill 2010, which is being examined by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, reads &quot;in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
It is calculated: &quot;The income from this interest is 117 million euros per year&quot;.
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists &quot;in order to modernize it, to increase the revenue obtained from it and so that this increase affects the Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
How much would it cost?
Phantasm.
This is not quantified in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
&quot;It is specified that these fiscal resources join the 4 billion euros of capital subsidy that will be mobilized by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project&quot;, we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
&quot;From the moment we generate revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then dig into 4 billion, it explains here.&quot;
&quot;It will be budgeted and used as needed&quot;.
SGP believes that the 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion belongs to subscribers who are not yet present, risks provoking a somewhat lively parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Vengeful hackers and malicious spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is exposed, a scandal that seems scandalous only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens, and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let&#39;s proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by a secret service (of any nation) consists entirely of press clippings.
The Americans&#39; &quot;extraordinary revelations&quot; about Berlusconi&#39;s sex life are announcing what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all but the two Berlusconi owns), and the sickly caricature profile of Gaddafi has long been the subject of sketches for cabaret artists.
The rule that classified documents may consist only of news already known is fundamental to the dynamics of the Secret Service, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Freemasons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to look for reports about non-existent ones), but because those who are engaged in the occult believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned .
This is Dan Brown&#39;s success mechanism.
The same goes for classified documents.
The whistleblower is lazy, and a lazy (or narrow-minded) intelligence chief (and if he isn&#39;t, he could be an editor at the newspaper Libération, for all I know) who only believes what he admits to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi that the US embassy sent to the State Department was the same that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was there such a fuss about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they are saying what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and the time when heads of state can talk on the phone or take a plane to have dinner together, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation were transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows very well that this is seemingly ignored out of hypocrisy.
However, the fact that it is being repeated publicly defies the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most highly classified information of the most powerful country in the world represents a hard blow, not insignificant, for the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its &quot;perpetrators&quot;.
But let&#39;s go from there to the deep truth of what happened.
Once upon a time, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to hold all power, like some kind of Big Brother who controlled his people&#39;s every move.
Orwell&#39;s prophecy has been proven since the ability to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway used and so on, has made the citizen a total victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the &quot;tombs&quot; with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - chosen as the citizen&#39;s avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets be maintained?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a true secret is a contentless secret (and a contentless secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all the information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is really a mysterious empty secret because it is taken out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton&#39;s secrets were empty secrets is to strip him of all power.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something great for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to a power so significant?
It is clear that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be equivalent to publishing it on a poster stuck on a street corner.
But it is also abundantly clear that with current technology it is useless to hope that a message over the phone can be kept secret.
There is nothing easier than finding out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know very well that for the moment my forecast belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are transported discreetly through uncontrollable routes, carrying only those messages that they know by heart or, rather, hiding rare information in the heel of the shoe.
The information will be kept in unique copies in keyed drawers: all in all, the attempted espionage in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated the wire-based (telephone) telegraph.
Videocassettes (analog) allowed moviegoers to take a movie step by step, move it forward and backward and reveal all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow you to jump by chapters, that is, by macro portions.
Via high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while it takes three and a half hours to travel by plane and the transport it involves.
So it is not unusual for politics and communication techniques to return to horse-drawn wagons.
One last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was being plotted in the secrecy of the embassy.
Now it&#39;s the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test the compliance with the promises of rapidly unblocked financing (so-called fast start or early financing) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were exposed
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010-2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, and France 1.26 billion euros (that is, 420 million per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled out a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment regarding fast start funding: a report detailing the action of its member states, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its 2012 pledge of €7.2 billion.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are &quot;new and additional&quot; under the Copenhagen Accord to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what &quot;new and additional&quot; means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonization, some member states, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered the year 2009 as a reference: international funding was preserved and it added 150 million to it for three years under the title of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment terms or with terms at the level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the financing of &quot;all new projects&quot; in 2010 are &quot;new and additional&quot;.
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Development Aid d&#39;Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, France&#39;s overall aid to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), to comply with its commitment to finance &quot;new and additional...
Another decisive element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 borrowed equals €1 donated.
Obviously, it is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be proven for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as equivalent to one euro that we give... , they should not have we would understand it from the title of our obligations, but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only give this justification: it &quot;respects&quot; its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% is a donation (36.1 million euros) - see the document EU so you can check for yourself.
It is the only EU country that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany requested 46% from there, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) keep their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 in satisfaction of their promise, France gives only 10 centimes and considers this effort comparable.
A beautiful piece of juggling!
To sum up, in its &quot;fast start&quot; financing, France is operating with a double sleight of hand: on the one hand with the development of the stock over time and on the other with the real financial burden.
Although it only spends 36.1 million euros, it manages to convince that it is spending 420 million euros &quot;new and additional&quot; in relation to its promises.
Manipulation of the finance minister (since it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative effect, both inside the EU (why would member states continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely naive...
The early funding chapter is just a small question, relatively short-lived, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But she could be an extra grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully that won&#39;t be the case for us.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounting records for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and decency and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid the discussion about deposits in long-term financing (another important chapter currently being discussed): we will not escape the question of &quot;additionality&quot; or the method of accounting for loans.
France should change its attitude to become as progressive on these deposits as it is on others.
So everyone is pinning their hopes on the new Environment Minister, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement of France&#39;s fast start and its vision of &quot;additionality&quot; and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Alarm about pesticides ingested by children.
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study released this Wednesday by the Future Generations Association (ex-Movement for the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results &quot;do not have a significant statistical value in view of the low number of analyzed samples, but are characteristic of the issue being processed&quot;, bought between July and September food normally consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack per child for about ten years in supermarkets in l&#39;Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including the official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sweets, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are considered carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five substances are clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could interfere with the endocrine glands (PE) , according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
&quot;Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we can clearly see that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminating substances, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking&quot;, the association states.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, presented by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, among others, a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, in which studies have found traces of powerful insecticides banned in the EU.
Additionally, ground beef, canned tuna, and even buns and gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, analyzes revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the &quot;richest&quot; with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not escape analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this &quot;cocktail of contaminants&quot; is likely to be underestimated,&quot; the study concluded.
The association Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) proposed &quot;in the face of an urgent situation&quot; to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the &quot;increase of the diseases of civilization&quot;.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
