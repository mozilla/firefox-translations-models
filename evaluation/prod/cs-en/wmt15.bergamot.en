Petr Cech: Transfer at the last minute?
It's all possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance comes in the winter.
Petr Cech, currently substitute Chelsea's substitute goalkeeper, is now not in the standstill over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smichov NH Hotel, talks to Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech national team for a game dress rehearsal with the Americans and subsequently also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the goal for Chelsea, Thibaut Courtois is given priority in the new Premier League season, with the Czech Republic coming into the position of a substitute for the first time in a decade at the London club.
It was speculated some time ago that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup in the early part of the season and failed to make the start of the league season, losing 2-4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He retired to the French league season with two wins and two draws, scoring off St. Etienne 5-0.
Relatively, the shoe is pushed the most by club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille amicably 1-1 at the weekend.
Reports jumped out on the English tabloid websites today that the Czech might want a Czech in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, the Czech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet set him for a 4-1 odds.
Peter, is it possible that you will change the jersey within the next few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never a 100% record in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that will not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
It would have to be a consensus between all parties Above all, it would depend on Chelsea's position as to whether or not the club would address any offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a possible new contract somewhere in the new site?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, they are all somewhere at the representative reunions and I'm sure a lot of transfers will be concluded today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing for the exit?
The situation where I didn't play in the first three games of the new season is new for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in the Chelsea goalkeeper's duel and it is up to the coach who he chooses what decisions he will make over the next few weeks.
What is the family's role to play in your decision?
I take all the factors.
The point of view of course is essential for me, but I also look at it from the personal page to which the family's needs of course belong.
Is it possible you could also be catching for another club in England?
That's the question I thought would never concern me.
But in football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule out anything.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan at a meeting in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is in Tokyo in a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe. On his first major visit since the election victory in May, he is to discuss economic and security commitments.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
The list includes plans for broader cooperation in the field of nuclear energy in the first instance.
According to the rapporteurs of India, he also hopes that the two nations will agree on cooperation on defence issues.
Police in Karrata arrested a 20-year-old young man after a motorcycle chase
The bike was stopped after a zone with a maximum speed limit of 70 km/hh rushed 125 km/hh and drove into the bush to escape the officers.
In the morning in Karrato, the patrol traffic police tried to stop a blue motorbike at the side of the road when they noticed that there was a 125 km/h on the exit from the service station on the Bathgate Road.
Police say the driver didn't stop and continued on to Burgess Road and then turned to the bush, so the officers lost sight of him.
The bike and the person who matched the driver's description were then spotted at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaře.
Karrathská police charged the 20-year-old with disobeying a call to stop and careless proceedings.
He will stand trial in Karrat on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be brought to justice on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charge during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He reportedly had 7. June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, to rape a woman.
According to the claim, Webster attacked her while "not conscious, she slept and was in a state of consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for the rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in the Nairn in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
The restoration of the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect organizing trade unions as a civil right.
"The way the unions work, the jobs work for the middle class," says Ellison, the Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is co-chaired to the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud that, together with the model of occasional rights, I can present the law empowering the staff.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in organising trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti-traffic forces
To amend the Law on Labor Relationships to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join the trade unions to sue in a civil court - and to sue for compensation or damages - an initiative is the right and necessary.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents are presenting in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other nations - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, broaden, and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remembering them, with the country in the same breath advocating democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States seized Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution designed to ensure that the Hideki Toja military autocracy was replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that the staff and their unions played a role in the formation of the new Japan, encompassing the language, and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States seized Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans were aware that the staff would need to organise and promote in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly said: "The right to create associations that will safeguard and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession or profession.
Arrangements that restrict this right or seek to be harmed by it will be revoked. Measures to be met with such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the proponents and the Roosevelt Guaranteed that "everyone has the right to create and enter unions to protect their interests."
Americans for generations accepted the basic premise that labour rights were human rights.
When countries advised other countries on how to create a civic and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend's Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the nation's strength, but have expanded it.
They increased the standard of living for millions of people, created the market for industry, and raised production to an unsuspected level.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we shouldn't.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in organising trade unions - is far behind.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have raised up America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could have closed all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which attorneys say would likely close all five cancer-performing abortions in the state.
A regulation enacted by the signature of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, to enter into force on 1 September, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, must obtain the authorisation.
"The nominating party will be able to lawfully conduct its activities and in the meantime obtains a permit," reads the order of federal judge John deGravels.
The hearing will be scheduled in one month for the judge to issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for abortion rights, the last to be in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision ensures the women in Louisiana are safe from the tricky law to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, the president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who sought the law from the lawsuit by lawsuit.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also involved the doctors from the two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, as well as asking for this authorisation to be granted.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures unconstitutional to the provision.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to have abortions, together with the Association of American Percik and Gynecologists and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permission is required to doctors with demands that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion countered by saying that the measures were aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed for the measures.
The Reproductive Rights Center said that only one doctor performing abortions was authorised in Louisiana.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not punish the doctors who perform the abortions while awaiting the processing of the request for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills owes more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video of the tribute to their deceased mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than in their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute reported that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
MALÁ STUDY: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than in women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynaecononcologists who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor has proposed to help boost the transport service to enable specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer was low regardless of the geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
Research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be released today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young mother, Elisha Neave of the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to a study by the Financial Times, according to a HTA study, a decline linked to the extraordinary decline of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the "game-based age group of consumers reaches the "majority age group" when today's young consumer generation reaches no-early £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on their gardens on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
As other factors threatening the sector, which makes an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas, where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of the front gardens is not popular with the front gardens, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of home owned has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household accounts for the lowest expenditure on gardening products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that lodging in lodgings or the lack of space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief horticultural advisor to the RHS, said: "For tenants, growing potted plants is very popular - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecasts a higher sales for this year thanks to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin's reunion at the reunion of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of the Hitler Youth, rattled with atomic weapons and, in essence, made it clear to everyone that he did not care about their views, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both tense nationalism and that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time passes in the east probably differently than in the west.
While the Western world thought the time of the wars over domicile over Europe was long gone, in the east, on the contrary, he thinks in the East that they have been overlooked for a long time and their international position must be reclaimed.
Such mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very identical cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the liquidation of inconvenient political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar, so to be quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large proportion of Russians, are probably missing after Russia ruled halfway around the world and the other part was shaking in front of them.
I guess Western politicians brought this on their own, maybe patted little on the shoulders, maybe not invited him where he wanted and maybe started to underestimate him, and he just behaved like a typical Russian male.
He'd tacky himself at home, pretending that he didn't really want to go anywhere, and he sharpened his knives at home.
Now he decided to take back the lost position.
He'll start slowly, he's got time.
He's probably the leader for life, so what's he'd be in the hurry.
He's trodden the Caucasus, now he's trampling the Ukrainians, then the Baltics' Dwarves are next.
They've been stinging the Russian bear in their fur long enough.
I'm sure China will notice that, too, and she's getting too much of a kick out and I'm sure she's looking for a long way east.
And those Germans are also pretty pissed off by that Vladimir, how well they're doing, and we gave them a spank at the age of 45.
How about we do one new Novorosijo in Karlovy Vary?
That would be a base, and our own are a lot of them there, and as they are being oppressed by the dach, they were already trying to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they had in that Czechoslovakia.
Nu vot, their Prime Minister Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, you can pee like onions and I eat all of their EU.
It would play so much to jump out at the great Russia.
It is to be remembered where their place is.
And as a detonator, we will use our fellows who live in their territory.
There's a lot of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed, they just oppress them and we don't let that happen, we'll protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, what else is born to be.
After all, Europe is only as good as a preposition that the proud Ivan can dance to a Cossack about.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign secretary called in the country's highest-ranking diplomat to explain the news of American and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants had discussed the report on Monday.
Der Spiegel, a German magazine, and The Intercept, a magazine, reported that, according to documents provided by a former analyst at the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states were following each other.
The earlier report, according to which Ankara was also targeted by the German intelligence service, sparked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones presents more tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the trickings of the fourth series were created.
The most visible are the computer editing of the series environment and the mass scene, with a cluster of soldiers becoming the giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director charged with corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by the Mallor's Attorney's Office for Blackmail by police and state council officials in the Calvia self-government district.
The director of the Calvia police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after being charged by businessmen and bar owners at the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into pre-trial detention after being brought against corruption charges by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street in which most of the bars and nightspots in Magaluf are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario, the complainant on Friday presented the prosecutor of the Mallor Corruption's anti-corruption prosecutor to blackmail by police officers and state city hall officials in the Calvia self-government area.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish State Police for links to corruption charges and will be interviewed by a judge and he and Navarre will be interviewed by a judge.
Spain's national daily ABC quoted disgruntled night-time business owners as saying that the public officials' favouritisms had serious repercussions for their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about making money," one of the businessmen said in court.
Don't mess with our living.
We have nothing to lose.
The Magaluf made it to the top pages of magazines worldwide after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist who had given oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars.
The island's authorities have since tried to oversee drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday party attendees in Magaful to reduce the number of notorious alcohol tours in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the event was given to the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organisers of the Carnage barn tour, pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-felling accidents, including a fashion wave known as "balconing" in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide Airport
JARO gave the south of South Australia an ice surprise, coming in with heavy rain and fierce winds that had seriously hit the Adelaide airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short showers associated with storms and gusts of wind, which began before 8pm and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early doses of spring arrived after the winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again to just 15.8°C on Monday.
The storm weather is believed to have contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land just after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at the Adelaide airport at that time reached about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop the second landing and eventually touched down at about 20:40.
The delay in the plane subsequently caused delays for further flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
The forecast is for temperatures in Adelaide on Tuesday to reach a maximum of 16 °C and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-combard shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. But schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory is recovering from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still evident.
In Asdod, a city in the south of the country, the kindergarten staff hit by a rocket has removed the remnants of the shrapnel from the wall, and are gradually expecting the children to return.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a rabbit Saad resident and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that "it's a little strange" to go to school all of a sudden.
"We've had some rough moments and never left the house," she said.
The Kibbutz, located close to the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the residents.
Until the cease-fire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their houses or abandoned their homes and set out in safer areas farther from Gaza to escape missiles and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village close to the Gaza border in which a Palestinian mortar missile killed a four-year-old boy, is hesitant to return.
The Education Minister said that about a dozen families have still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in the surrogate schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that was heavily struck by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding, "We will provide you with education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an unlimited-time basis.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key challenges as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of the two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures, estimating that at least half of those killed were militants, even though it does not have clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 missiles and mortar missiles and mortar missiles during the fighting at Israeli cities, mainly in the country's south.
The Israeli military, for its part, has carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people hid in a hundred UN schools that turned into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as the Jewish children and the other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from school in the largest city in Gaza.
Willow at the reunion: I stand behind Vácha.
And Lafatu is suffering from the temperature
The Czech national football team met before noon today in Prague before Wednesday's preliminary match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-man cadre, Spartans striker David Lafata, who is suffering from the temperature, is in trouble.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players involved and David probably still has a little bit of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's two or three days, or it's already fit tomorrow, that's to be seen by his health, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some kind of soreness, but it's not like they can't train or participate in the match on Wednesday with the USA," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday night, Vrba called up Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha as the last player.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision to make, with other midfielders.
I decided on the basis that Lukas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was very difficult to make the decision, but I stand by it,' said Willow to Vách.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens to Latata
It is not impossible that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend with a great performance was flashed by, for example, the Liberec Josef Šural, who scored a hat-trick.
Of course, there are players who have shown form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata is.
In case he can't be available on Wednesday, I'm not saying I can't donate to one of the players who impressed in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon the national team will play in training at Strahov, on Tuesday then a classic pre-season training session before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph session.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will aim for a first-ever victory under Willow.
In the previous three preseason matches, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is on 9 September from 8:45 p.m.
Peshice goes to the Dutch in Italy
Vrba is pleased to have more time to train, unlike in previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can rehearse with them certain things that maybe we didn't have so much time for before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting the best prepared for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national team coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have the game and we'll have a shot and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what the changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to high-profile statistics, prices of flats in the winter have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the Housing Valt Index in the Australian capital of the RPD CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase climbed to 10.9%, more than double in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RPD research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
Figures from the FP The data show that prices of Sydney flats rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices risen, averaging between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was hurt by a state-mandated reduction in spending, and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has started, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the persistent high level of auction sales, generally high sales speeds and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never huged me.
He never called me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrant in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked in the factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry rehearses the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to cope with several unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a "pretty" therapy session and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew precious little about him.
You've never seen his face before, you've only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - would go to the bar with him, discussing things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never spoken to him like that.
Most of my life, he's been a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Recently, Henry had visited a foundry at Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked into what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light in it today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, then you could hear him slowly singing for himself, because he was washing off the foundry.
When I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I'd come to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry spent his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't embrace anyone, he said, "I'm glad to you."
It wasn't until my mom was sick and dying that we started to think, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter, Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop "I love you" with it?
Don't hire me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
French, who he was married to for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very overweight, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat all the carrots.
The change in the direction of the departure of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cropped beard.
After receiving acclaim from the critics of his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
A Comedy of Errors and the Fences of Augusto Wilson followed.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled out his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ spotted him on stage parodied someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-king of the 1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black impersonator/commerce on television."
He was learning as he went.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn how to make up working jokes between 1975 and 1985, and be a star and appear on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which the actors dressed up as black, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was already uneventful about it.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on the big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "the years-long award-winning major product of British television" but was also a "grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s, it was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decades were taken up by ads, documentaries, TV series and roles in the movies, but after his series, LennyHenry.tv, on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "So what are you going to do now, Lene, because it looks a little like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little out of the way."
Next up was a documentary on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn him at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was worried about it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry had delivered twenty lines of line from Othello's closing speech for the documentary, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's giving me courage.
"That's what it's about. It's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the rehearsal was hard, and I'd read the play for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in for trouble, which they didn't.
He soon began playing in a Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the confiscation of the audience.
"The footage in his head said to me, 'Before the computer fixed, you must entertain them for ten minutes now.'"
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage, and something in me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
It could be solved for me by someone else.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotts at Duchess Theatre
Learning the Plots text was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, he adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign of God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a UWN TOWN voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm glad in the rehearsal room.
Henry still remains the brain of a comedian - he interrupts our conversation all the time with humorous performances as he enters and steps out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't enjoy it like I used to.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director who helps to put out the outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So, your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all of her civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who are not registering in the next two weeks will stop receiving a payout.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary after they left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatt promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state was losing at the very least $1 million (£700,000) a month to pay for non-existent staff and further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be placed on bank accounts after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves the civil service, said the BBC's Nairobi, Wanyam Chebusiri, a BBC reporter from the capital.
All civil servants must attend the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government statement said.
He goes on to say that anyone who fails to appear without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
"By decimating the actual public service staff, this measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to purify the payroll at both levels of the government, thus resolving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested over "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of a "conspiracy against the government."
The police department has yet to comment on the case.
According to the Hurriyet Dail News, there were fourteen high-ranking officials among the detainees.
Some of them were implicated in a corruption investigation in December, targeting government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone listening for phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Most of the schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools took place the traditional ceremony for September 1st.
Not all of Ukraine is the peace.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the combined Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that the children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the children wearing embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give the teachers flowers.
In Ronka Fairhead, the BBC may have found a heavy-time boss
It carries with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management, and an internal conclave conservative party.
She has experience in the leading lines.
She began her career at consultants Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
For seven years, she was the Financial Times executive director. She resigned when her senior job at the parent company, Pearson's, was filled by her younger colleague.
They say her severance package was close to £1 million.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, the former director of the BP, when Cameron needed a private expert in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice of poison.
Not only is the BBC a large and complex entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: in the top of the BBC's own-led hierarchy, but also out in the voice of the public in times of unrest, when things are not working.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But the director would risk coming into a company as intricate as a Chinese dynasty, dismantling it, and thereby taking his own jobs.
It's a tough challenge.
If it hadn't been so hard, a lot of people would have liked to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and its revisit its status.
As the competition array expands and the new technology challenges the old security, the immediate negotiation of the concession fees for the BBC carries a great danger.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is certainly the world's largest media business.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production is up to 96% of households, each costing only 40p.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of the supporters, up from 31% a decade ago.
BBC services use models have changed: Today, newspaper subtitles are shown on my mobile phone, and I can watch iPlayer shows that I missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve the offensive tweet
The tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, released on Sunday, featured an offensive image by a Democratic Attorney-Depart who initiated Perry's criminal charges for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry's account, distancing himself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized by the authorization left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the inquiries immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for managing him.
The previous tweet was posted by an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County State's Attorney's Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to disburse funds for her office, which brought forward to be brought to a major jury in Austin this month.
The caption in the tweet read: "I don't always drive with three times the level of alcohol in the blood as the limit allowed . . . but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry for holding me accountable."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was designated by the Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified law team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the lawsuit for the prosecution of the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut the $7.5 million in the state's public interest fund, which is headquartered in Travis County and prosecuted corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection was prompted by a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civil rights activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes he becomes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done by now, tweeting with his own photo of him running near the lake, saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal
One of London's most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market has "reunited" to the normal level of activity in South-East England.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespered fears about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developer's investment company for discerning clients, Berkeley said on Monday: "From the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from the top point in 2013."
The London-based housing market did well during the downturn, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to Land Registry data, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far overtaking an average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening pound, they have not been as attractive to foreign buyers of London's properties in recent months - some of which have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "sleeping tax" that politicians came up with before next May's parliamentary elections.
The London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow the pace of market growth for both house and price sales during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has downgraded its home prices to 3% for the 2015 forecast for a rise in prices of London property.
Meanwhile, according to real estate agency WA Ellis, the volume of transactions fell by a quarter each year in London's most expensive neighbourhoods, Mayfair and Kensington.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a boon for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added, "Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and as a result, the forward sales have been maintained."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the 2007 crisis.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to £380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6bn.
Speaking on Monday before the annual meeting of Pidgley, he said it was predicted that Berkeley's annual returns would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley's shares stopped at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Hacker posted pictures of nude Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online for a hacker who claimed to have a "listic" of photos of hundreds of aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the star of the "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "an obvious privacy breaches."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who releases the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker reportedly acquired the photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image-sharing server, due to a gap in the Apple iCloud internet repository system. The BuzzFeed's alleged list of photos of the hacked victims includes the names of dozens of stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, however, the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" was also criticized on Twitter by Winstead.
"I hope those of you who look at the photos we took in the privacy of home with your husband years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice, a friend of the Nickolodeon cable series, "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were genuine. She posted on Twitter, "These alleged nude photos of me are SUWORK, people."
Better to cut it out in the prime. *deliberate pun on the sidelines.
Buzzfeed announced Sunday night that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande had denied that the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary sample from Howard Jacobson's a touted new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually unfolding like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, complex, violent, isolated, and perhaps a little irascible.
And then she shook his hand.
Inexor, he admitted it.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this abilities of his was an incipient love affair, which more than ever promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of his life and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a frail beauty with a wild-haired mane and a fickle heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south came with an older companion Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited the property in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, the Eden Valley.
The house was not lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs with the volcisms signed up to the windows, as if to think the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge roints of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, terrifying and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
A closer selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to a public-build station that supplied the country with comforting music and soothing news as the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian, which his father liked to listen to with the overturned rolls of the rolls.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't forbidden - there was nothing really forbidden - they just weren't played.
They were helped to get to the desuetud, as did the word desuetudo itself.
Folk taste has accomplished what regulations and outlaws could never prove, and just as people are choosing a memoir in books in which the poor man becomes rich, cookbooks and love novels, so music is chosen by ballads.
Kavern let himself down to the bottom and began to play the imaginary piano and, in a coarse, comlike voice, sang to Aill's big boots.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he had played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in the word that started for the speech that started, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny even then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn has never heard one.
They did not play jazz, even though it was outright outlawed.
Improvization has gone out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one "if."
When the melody started playing, people wanted to know exactly where they'd end up.
Same with humor.
His unseeingcraties got on people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor expressed in song.
Although he had not heard of Samma Davisus Junior until he was ten, he knew Kevern jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she could not remember a time when the popular singers were not black.
Also without laws or coercion.
The permissan society is in which each part of it with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were fortuitously spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean were well suited to the temperament and the constitution for entertainments and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if originally, were gifted to electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, Greeks left, washed the dishes.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents quickly did not leave the country while it was happening, WHAT SE STALO, KDY SE TO STALO - they were afraid of being accused of putting them on the fire, actually worried that they would spend the fire the next time - they opened a restaurant where the Swallows were sold and smoked water pipes, they didn't draw attention to themselves, and inactivity was slowly consuming them.
To each to his talents.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn found it hard to see how the foul words Kavern had just sang to her could have produced music.
The music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
From behind the soundproofed leaves, no word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his lips in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
'He was witty,' he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and shielded Kevern's view.
There was nothing to see in the wide world but a jumble of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She looked genuinely upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked again.
Feelings not exactly.
Maybe a little ankle...
You're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate?
That's not true.
It's just a silly song.
He could have called her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me right now," he tried.
I'm a bit creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, he was often in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to curb the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Perhaps his father was cruel intentionally.
Perhaps Kavern was deliberately cruel.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddened and rose from the cot, shedding the radio and spilling the unfinished wine.
Tin wine, so it wasn't for the drink.
She looked as if she was shaking in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm sickly attracted to being a jerk," she said. . . .
Except I'm not drawn to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she faced him.
She thought he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the foundations it was the same as it was here.
The same wide and ice ocean was marched over.
The same deranged men, then, WHAT STALO, even even tougher and grumpilyer than their ancestors, the smugglers and the spoiler, wander angrily from pub to pub, ready to lay hands on any woman who dared to refuse or laugh at them.
A moron?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First, cuddling her - cuddling became the most common term for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: an antidote to the mourning ballads about the love the radio spewed - first she was anointed, then one of hers.
In Kevern's view, too sophisticated because the cuddling was an act of violence in itself.
Ailinn Solomons neverbicly indicated to him that he would leave.
He rose from the cot like an old man.
She felt cranky, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched her walk away - as if she had been watching him from a upstairs window - the man he had caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart tightened for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders slumped, shamed, defeated, all the belligerence had left him - why did it feel like he knew this look well, though she couldn't recall a single moment, until today, that she'd ever seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statutory Public Mood Monitoring System, prepared a short article about the persistence of minor and moderate violent acts in the country's mitigation or downright stopped, had it most been expected if enough money and energy had been spent on its removal.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "to be reassured by the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the hollow, hard-to-reach places of the earth, where, despite the tips of the church towers, the tides of human kindness rarely appeared historically, despite the tips of the church towers of the living fences of human kindness."
But some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh at the sentimental ballads, devour the unfortunate stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only do old brutality in rural areas hold as stubbornly as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, the roads, and even sports playgrounds.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too florid," her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again objected to her privacy and silence.
A feminist?
More silence.
"I'm not asking for that," Rabinowitz said at last, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unbeaten companies.
But a kind of hypersensitivity that is utterly acceptable and commendable in itself can sometimes distort the judgment as you have demonstrated.
Apparently, you yourself are biased against the church - the things you call "cruel" and "brutal" others might also interpret as an expression of natural power and energy.
Always solving CO SE STALO, WHEN SE TO STALO, as if that had happened, yesterday, was preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
Behind his head, the recommendation flickered pink on the light board, which had been broadcasting Forning to the world of the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, converse, explain, agree, apologize.
It's better to speak than to be silent, the sung word is better than the written one, but there's nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, when she was sure her superior had finished, "and I'm not saying I no longer hath the wound healed as we tell it was to heal.
My main concern is that if we are not warned about this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to CO SE STALO, KDY TO STALO.
This time, though, we won't air your anger and distrust on the others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
This was to indicate endless patience.
"You're looking too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that may have taken and may not have made to your grandparents.
You also go too far in the fact that you talk about venting their "reach" and "deniation" to the "others."
I should not be reminded of anyone in your position that, in understanding the past and in the protection of the present, we do not speak of "us" and "unni."
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
'Whether, if we are honest with each other,' Esme said, 'no one is guilt-free.
I'm not blaming anyone.
It was fair or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to say - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to blame for anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past for but to learn from it -
The past exists to make us forget about her.
If there's one thing I can add to that -
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into consideration," he said, and released her.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk in a manner described by passers-by as "brutal and furious."
Coincidence is happening.
The Forest Kingdom Army says no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Foresthoth Kingdom have denied that they have organized a coup to overthrow the government, and say they have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official seat and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After declaring he was being threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to the neighboring South Africa with his family.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the command of the defense forces of the Lesotha was in talks after receiving several reports from the information service that there were several groups in the police line-up that were planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to make havoc in the country," he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power with force, the actions of the Leshoth defense forces appear to be marked by the mark of the coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesoth said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament sessions for internal disputes in June, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that, despite the opposite of the allegations, he would not undermine his actions to the government.
Eurozone production at 13-month low
Production growth, according to a closely watched poll in the euro area, slowed to a 13-month low in the euro area.
The final index of eurozone purchasing managers (PMI) from June's 51.8 to fell to 50.7 in August.
A figure higher than 50 indicates expansion.
New orders have been reduced and the factories have been hurt by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the Bank to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US had approached during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical insecurity have on manufacturers is becoming more visible," said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Germany's production PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from the expansion of the stagnation.
Signs that the drivers of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of more monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best you can say about the production list of shopping executives for August is that it shows the sector is still growing."
He added: Eurozone manufacturers currently have a very complex life, because the increasing geopolitical tensions - especially between Russia and Ukraine - are adding even more uncertainty to the still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably hit the trade - in particular consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some of the orders to be deferred or even cancelled, mainly costly.
He said that, as "equite more likely," it appeared that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell for the Beslan survivors: Ten years since the horror of the cast school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
During the ordeal, which lasted three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, of whom more than half were children
We returned to Beslan to seek out some of the victims who escaped death during the atrorose at the school
Exactly ten years after the terrifying cast of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the surviving heroes warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
On September 1, 2004, at the start of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy united east and west, leading to negotiations and the future in this disastrous disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to seek out some of the victims who had escaped death during the school's atrocity.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the misfortune, even if the memory of the inferno caused by the terrorists will live in them.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like they were dying - is over.
A girl trying to climb back into a ruined school gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitriy Beliakov, only in her underwear trying to climb back into the bombed-out school gym after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused, Aida was desperate for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
'A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't,' Aida had said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and got back in to find my mommy.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but said yesterday, "Three months ago, the pains came back.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another surgery.
In my knee, bits of shrapnel were left with pieces of shrapnel.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said determinedly.
"It just happened to me and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remind myself of the ones who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to your friends about it.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate from Jeru Gapoev's class were killed there.
We played together as a kid and imagined us going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten captivity, but the memories fade a little by the year.
I'm glad that so many people in the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we got from the UK and other countries.
When I look at my picture online of my school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
A boy who escaped the rainy bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, the children start school at the age of seven) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, ran, and saw a weeping toddler along the way, grabbed the child's hand and ran through a spray of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't have saved her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to her freedom and lay in the hospital with her injured leg and, on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After meeting again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World) where then-Schr prime minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie, were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play the computer games that shoot in, and I have no problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the yard who didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could have picked anything I wanted in the toy store, and how I drove through a convertible.
But now he is worried about a place like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffer because of the war he and his friends suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror," says Damir, who attended the monastery's volunteering last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work in the police force one day and I hope to be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says, "They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children to shout and run around, and the silence took months.
He remembers his journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the chance to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damiro.
I remember Damir's appetite for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot at them with a water pistol, and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month away from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in those ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they're bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what the horror is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to murder each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet kid, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time he goes to the gym and light candles.
He had trouble with it when he was younger - I remember sometimes lying down on the couch with his face facing away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He wasn't asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he fired all his guns or other toys. Damiro is 17 today, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure he was dead for several hours and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw the inferno, there were pieces of human body everywhere.
I was pretty sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember screaming 'Damir, run, run!' but I was convinced he hadn't heard me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on, unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Ahon: Beslan survivor Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack on the right, Grigori
As he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot dead his classmates, there was a fear in his bloodied face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at the school on his first day and rushed to take her older son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigori survived.
As the date gets closer, it's getting harder to think about and talk about it.
Not a single day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to have happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Grigory's photo (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was immortalized as a sculpture (right)
I remember Grigori really looking forward to school that day, he said he wanted to give his teacher a hug.
I learned that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of the weeping Grigori in San Marino.
Grigori doesn't like looking at the photo, and we're hiding it in the bookcase at home.
I get it, but I also think that because of the picture, people around the world know the pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says, "The important thing is that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragies like this are still under investigation, but no one ever finds out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, then how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing to do with such pain.
To forget a little, he needs decades.
It's had an impact on my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
Then, when I came back to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why, as September 1st, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't help it because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogori Farniyyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held to the feet of the murdering terrorist
A miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregori, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service but was unable to suffer from the injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
I'm older now, and it's said that kids can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say, it's not true.
"I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the year after - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I will never go there again, and please do not ask me to show you where I am sitting on the well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I bring it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt myself, but I'm walking normally.
Even so, I was unable to enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted to.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was not possible.
My next hobby is the animals, so I got into the vet.
I finished it for the second year.
He learns how to heal all animals from "kick to cows."
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something that children should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "The pain will be here all the time.
He's inside and he's getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will attend the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigori's not going.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God, he gave it back to me. Here in Beslan, there's clues everywhere.
It's staying with us.
Gregori is an adult today, but he carries the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's overcame that 50% of the horror, but you can't completely overcome it and you can't forget it.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
A lot of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm hurt by the loss of the dead.
I know families in whom more children were born, but also widows who did not marry again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget my heart almost jumping out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I observe what is happening in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which is hard to believe.
We've been a friendly country in the past, so how did we get to the point of fighting together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could have taken all the rebels together and thrown away them as far as I can.
Alyona Tskaev, 10
The child who was taken to safety by a special commando unit
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is carried into a proffular Russian special commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world gasped in 2004 when little Alyon was carried out in her arms by a Russian police officer from the Beslan captivity.
The terrorists released her, but in captivity at the school's gym, they kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little girl named Kristina after the dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, has no recollection of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "it's a big happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories he recalls for the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man accused of knocking down girl in sign crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man in court for hitting a three-year-old girl in a sign crossing in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a Pittenween crossing in East Neuk.
Prosecutors claim that Stewart did not run his Audi Q3 with sufficient regard and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart (78) of Anstruther denied the charges in court in Dundee.
Judge Charles Macnair set the trial date for January.
4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoors camera, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at the family party with some cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check your gear.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set up the camera depending on which type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to the dark underwater environment.
And by the time you get started, see how far you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only designed up to 5 feet, with another one up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to the purchase and rating of digital cameras in both normal and waterproof design.
Do a few pictures at a time - a lot of them don't come out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with a composite of photos, but the outsiders don't have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be hard to see under the water and the composition of the shot will be unveiled.
So always take multiple shots.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of frames with a slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive of light, it dwindles significantly.
If possible, stay close to the waterfront, lake or sea close to the surface during a photo shoot.
This also allows you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you will see.
Get close to the subject.
This is excellent advice if you take pictures on land, but underwater it is even more important because of the more muffled light.
This is particularly important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo framing, you need to get closer to the subjects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality could change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving the pain caused by both illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the aftermath of torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnoses and diseases, the patients treated overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without power.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and included his wife, Juliet, with reproaches.
He noted, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably agitated.
Something was wrong.
A colleague gave him an X-ray of the chest.
He had skied in the French Alps two weeks before.
The X-ray results came in.
It had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that afflicts the pleeist-orchell or the lining of the lungs.
For most, it is difficult to determine what was the cause of cancer.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But the Mezoteliom is different.
In almost all cases, the cause of asbestos is the subject - a building fibrous material that was previously described as "miraculous," but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasurers, builders, carpentry and shipyards.
Toxin used in the industry in another era now appears to be a cause for concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
As it turns out, a cancer epidemic is at the height of Britain today.
The number of deaths per meseloom is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from the disease a year are twice as many as the number of car accident victims.
Deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the UK in the future
The reason we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos species were eventually banned by law in 1999) is that it usually takes several decades to develop a mesothelioma.
The disaster of mesotheliome is not just about veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases, it is still present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops we shop in.
So the Mezothelioma does not respect the social stratum, wealth, the occupation, or the age.
The privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools are not a hideout.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the repositories of this mortal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor did he inspect isolation.
He tried to find out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos were in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormans - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was a question he could partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in practice at Guy's Hospital and who were then shown to meralliom in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with a mesothelioma when he was 48.
When 17. he died in February of that year, 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not usual for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat to Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A perusal insight into the files from the archives of the courts, to which the disability often turns and require compensation, shows how much the mesotheliome disaster has spread.
For example, this June was admitted by Marks & Spencer to subject asbestos to Janice Allen, due to negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the sites being the company's flagship, a shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started work for M&S.
Today he has two children, who are in his 20s.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of the mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he'd be involved in me.
There aren't many people who know something about asbestos.
In fact, it is not one substance that is asbestos, but a group of six minerals.
He was named because of his fibrational structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often today, chryzotil can be found in buildings, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler tights and even brake lining.
It is not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and the WHO see it as a "great health risk" that can cause death.
But the more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amsus) and the blue asbestos (steydolit).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that "there is a conclusive but circumstantial evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesetia [in the United Kingdom]."
Marsk & Spencer was exhibited at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not uncommon at all.
His patient study claims that "a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
Much of this exposure is due to the "currime and weathering" of the buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even on the center of the government, the people of the government may have to suspect that they may be on display of asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that service lifts and pipes behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be broken by something as harmless as the "strong air flow."
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Directorate of Parliament's Services at Parliament insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate," it is now envisaged that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to be done to thoroughly view Parliament, electricity to be modernised and asbestos removed, and that, rather than on the Green Benchmarks in Westminster, MPs will sit on the premises of the Conference Centre of Queen of Elizabeth II.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this discrepanseed will cost lives.
All of them can now wait for.
One of the people who was never able to determine when they had an asbestos exhibit occurred is Graham Abbott, the doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at the hospital where the presence of asbestos was established," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It's difficult to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day of early December 2009, when he was climbed by something like a chitchat.
He was 45, it was evening and he was in the middle of the surgery.
Suddenly I shuddered.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't get by car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the pleopian, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
Yet they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms came back, often after he had trained and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the OR and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott did not associate anything with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and came into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT scan and X-rays with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a probe was introduced into the space between the lining of the chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to not take much of a tendency," he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results arrived between Christmas and New Year's: "They told me it was a mesotheliome."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesotoliome
Abbott began to meet with the sisters of the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
The people exposed to these asbestos buildings are now beginning to show up.
So the mezoteliom is now starting to apply to younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were in the basement in hospitals, so it was unlikely to endanger patients.
But the members of the staff who crossed the basement corridors between the buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement cafeterias (as often Graham Abbott) came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, decades after the war, hospitals were places where they could save the patients' lives, but also a place that could have endangered the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's Kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just the hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many asbestos people were on display at school.
Somewhere, in the myriad hours of chemistry, the students were building a Bunsen kahan on the asbestos pad.
There were a website dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless items such as floor tiles or roofs of tool cushioners in our homes were commonly included asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from a mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s while breaking down a garden house.
So be careful how you're ruining the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is untreatable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes you a while to get it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor position to the position of the patient.
As a myriad of patients before him, he also remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been told that 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to live to see another Christmas.
That's what it is.'
Mezotelelom is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - the breathing itself - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
The asbestos are made up of small fibres.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in a plee-ring, lining of the lungs.
The ea pigeon fibres irritate the plerium and can induce a mutation of cells.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibres in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiotic surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson appears to have been exposed to asbestos and which, paradoxically, is the head center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knows Lawson and has also treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos, probably during his experience at the hospital.
Asbestos needles enter the tissue of the lung, says Treasure, and "the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
By its nature, it has been invasive since the very beginning.
The mesothelioma of the common therapeutic options used for other types of cancer does not work as much.
There is a hot debate, for example, about the effectiveness of the operation.
Some would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleura," he says.
You don't get a scalpel around it.
The cancer "not exactly responds to chemotherapy" which "has some effect" but does not cure.
"Sometimes there's someone who can survive the lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott made contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became individual support and advisor for people equally affected.
When they called, he said cheerfully, "Hello, you've reached the cancer headquarters."
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and he was still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would have lasted four months, and would probably have extended his life by only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson "could have put things to be in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the thoracic surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to be sent to him, but I just called in and they gave me a look," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a requiñetta and have to approve the reimbursement.
In order to access the best available treatments, the issue of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face further financial concerns - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, it was known that asbestos is harmful to health," says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter corporate negligence.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually leveled off, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exhibit at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the case's investigation, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the basement section in question was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To put an exposure to fatal asbestos per company or instead of working - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with a mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed hands or went bankrupt.
The fail-safe records were lost.
And those who are now resisting charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was passed this year, making it easier for mesothelioma to seek a settlement even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, which is paid for by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos, but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally award them as a settlement - around £120,000.
There are 300 successful applications expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like the Mesopeliom Patients, thinks £350 million is a "good job."
"It's an insurance-written agreement for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time had not been hijacked and people with mesothelioma would be able to find out to their former employers and sue them in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former Secretary of Labor and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had in gaps."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, due to the seven deaths each year, swift action was required.
"People are suffering too much and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the Mesopicus Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that, unlike Tom Treasura, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a survival rate of five years in up to 40% of patients.
It made Abbott stronger.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There is something that drives you.
If you surrender, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
In late August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The inspection did not show any symptoms of the disease.
I went to the next check-up in March [2014].
I had a few spots scattered in my chest [cancer].
It was just approaching my 50th birthday.
It doesn't threaten life.
He's into it.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security, when I die, or to show the woman how the alarm clock on the cauldron works.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for the father of Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such interviews must be faced by all cancer patients.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just a hint of a chance to survive.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought to Stephen Jay Gould) with it a bleak certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "inter-traliehs are not a threat to life."

World production is held at two million tonnes per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
China's parliament, despite the proliferating discussions on democratic reform, decided on Sunday to not allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
It is likely that the move will spark long-promised protests in the business district of Hong Kong, as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
China's People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We weren't surprised, but we were infuriated," said lawmaker Emily Lau, the Democratic leader.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People were lied to in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership elections would cause a "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain returned to China's administration to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that from 2017, residents will be able to vote for executive power.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold a firm grip on the process of nominating a committee strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only the candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be admissible.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded some of Hong Kong's biggest and most watched protests in several years.
Most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are the Occupy of Centralists with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial quarter if Beijing does not grant them a universal right of voting.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy movement gathered in the rain outside the headquarters of Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would launch waves of protest in the coming weeks.
But they provided no further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement "did in balance the occupation of the Central Office as a final step in the event that all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We regret to announce that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday they stepped up the protection of the government's headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
The impelling of the unrest, according to many Hong Kong residents, is a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The surge of landmen is increasing competition for products and services.
There are also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent by the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy of Central Alliance movement, saying their demonstrations threaten the trade - the Hong Kong lifeboat.
"The protest he's talking about could cause much more economic damage, depending on how many people attend and for how long," says politician Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could harm investment.
Chinese state media have also come up with reports in recent days that have been portrayed by Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents run by the West.
In the summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The pre-election agitator?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
Small soccer is played in the regional city of Vysočina by around 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their top-flight is now called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that goes to the local elections in October.
In addition, the ten on his ticket is the head of a small soccer in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," Mráka said.
The situation surrounding the first league of small soccer was already addressed by lawyers at Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the system for distributing subsidies.
Malá kicking received around a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, too, the figure is in the hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of small soccer is not against the law or the directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the authority to modify the rules for awarding grants and subsidies," said Municipality spokesman Radek Tulis.
Drawing subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing support for one political party in the election as a little soccer, it will probably not be possible.
The highland "great" football has not yet come to a similar demand from politicians.
That the ČSSD would be formed a regional champion, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And a class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like to see us contacted by company sponsors," said Miroslav Vrzáček, chairman of the regional football association.
The head of small football will not let another party and the movement into the league name
According to the players of the small soccer, the sport in Jihlava would have deserved its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách pitch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
There, however, will be built, for example, in my opinion, a senseless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka pointed out.
The mayor of Jihlava, Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS), responded that the small soccer playgrounds with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have the maximum use.
We are preparing to upgrade or build sports venues at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been a huge advance in the last few soccer lessons," Vymazal added.
Other political parties in the names of the leagues will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field enters the partnership, we don't put the other in there," he explained.
"The political movement in the league's name, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the town hall commission for sport.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr Mráka is using the association Malá kopaná Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition infiltrates university life - freshmen can fly a jet
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
To leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service had a security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - a very important freshman) options for students this year, we will arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and the maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the services were yet to be launched, they did not yet have any reservations, but added: "Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay a £9,000 annual tuition, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago, today's students are different in terms of anticipation and desire - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, the vice president of the Union for Higher Education, noted: "For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many of the students who are entering the university this month have to come to terms with the financial crisis before throwing out thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants is unable to keep up with rising costs for basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed teenager.
Those present waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz noted the shift in online discussions by white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer the sex over race.
With increasing tension in the Midwest, which drew the attention of the national press, Perez noted that the white woman's reaction was 100 % focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the shooting on August 9th, personal articles with headlines such as "whites' exhroom think of Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about women's oppression" occurred relatively late.
According to Peréz, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level," she said.
People felt they had to comment on what had happened.
The crisis we face is characterised because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially outspoken that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Professor of English at the University of Ohio, Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American women have to face every day and which are not seen as "female issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about life with my partner on Facebook, and it gets 150 leagues from people around the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the coloreds being trapped in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How is it that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have addressed the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race and the gender of dichotomy.
The black women, she said, could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing up these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women are now merited by the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a female-speaking professor and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason was the rape of a white woman in almost every case," Hattery said.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of a white woman.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when a campaign fighter like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or black people - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet cards on women's voting rights and focus on the right for blacks to focus later on," Hattery said.
When we think of this, we get an important perspective on why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and children.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize anti-jigs in the Association of Southern Women to Prevent Lynch.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the surge of the white feminists' reactions to the questions that the events at Ferguson have raised - the question of police conduct, racial discrimination - reflect a time when white feminists had to "cure" the questions the black women faced with generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists in these areas of [the traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists, who have made a career in the fight for reproductive law and access to contraception, are now investigating what that means.
Significant feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took Facebook's attack two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, where they posted a Guardian column of Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the danger in society - and the views on the race that differ significantly in the opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem espouses intercessionist feminism, which encompasses both race and gender issues, her comments on the issue of race in America are confusing some people.
An American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of "Who Steals Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stein's remarks by Ferguson face criticisms earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for the boys.
But when the White House launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, many feminists, including Gloria Stein, drew angry reactions.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After US border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied liveers in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration laws reform - this time as a women's question - has been raised again.
Andrea Mercad, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to present the issue as a necessity for women, the only thing she had to do was share the immigrant stories.
"They speak for themselves," Mercad says.
As most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position to be vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have been echoed in female organizations," she said.
The shelter of the pig in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, the pig rested in the living room.
The one-bedroom single-seat house, which is for sale for £120,000, is on a private trip in Ipswow.
The information photos included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig sofa.
Real Estate Connells said the pig in the photograph was a pet of the owners.
"The photo was there by mistake, and that's why it's already been removed," the office spokesman said.
In the property's property information, the real estate agency, Connells, described the former prayer room as a "single-based single-seat house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in the promotional material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search for a new millionaire in southeast Perth is underway, one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
The Harvey tobacconists were lucky for the second time in five years, the last time it was a $1 million win in November 2009.
But the happy winner has yet to sign up.
The store's owner, Steve Forward, said the entire city in southwest Perth was talking about the winnings.
It's the main theme and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners split a single win in Western Australia last month, completing a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, and just weeks earlier, the couple had won a whopping $7.5 million at Belmont.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said the prize would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia in this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains will not start in the evening.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL called the protest a warning strike for which he deliberately selected time outside the rush hour.
With the strike time chosen, the GDL takes into account the many people who are returning from the weekend on the rail only on the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of commuting people during the day," the trade union said in a press release on Monday morning to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should be hit primarily by freight, less by passengers," added the GDL.
DB has yet to release an official response to the strike announcement.
Nor is it clear how the protest action will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The union is demanding a five percent increase in train drivers' wages and a reduction in working hours by two hours per week.
Currently, the average salary for train drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
Train drivers work 39 hours a week at DB.
DB refuses to accept pay increases in the reduction of working hours.
They stress that the wage valuation of train drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel, for whom DB does not provide for the shortening of the working week.
Krest's car was in danger of catching fire.
That's why he quit the Barum Rally
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so it didn't even occur to me that something like this would happen.
Could the exhaust not be repaired provisionally and continue at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we'd just headed in, yes.
But there were two more stages ahead of us and we couldn't.
It's got a high temperature in it, and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford to.
At full pace, you've done five stages.
What impression of them did you think?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, yet I didn't drive through the vint.
It was all caused by the car being piped for over six months to make it level.
The race showed that we did it.
You drove it so hard you could realistically think of winning.
I prepared myself and the car in such a way that we really had to win.
The work didn't come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not materialise.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the top guys who stepped down prematurely from the fight for primacy.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring or Lappi also dropped out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites withdrew?
Yes.
It was a shame for the spectators, especially, because the race was over for that prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing a car, has also been moving to the top.
But he paid for flying out of the track and taking a nearly two-minute shortfall.
How happy were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could have repeated the podium.
He was in the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had set up the car well.
He was going very fast.
Exactly one year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about the ride again to make a regular participant in the rallying races?
Not at the moment.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race and I still didn't keep it up.
I decided to go again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I think I'll go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, acquaintances or unknowns, kept asking if I was going to go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's next for you after Barumce?
The team continues on.
We will go to Vyškov next week, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope he didn't damage the car here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabia of Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
Mira and I are facing a European double race in Switzerland and in Corsica.
To do that, we'll have to do things for next year.
Can you imply anything?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was in the World Championships, you were fifth in the series to reach your best in the series.
Aren't you tempted to try out the tracks there again?
Not tempted.
Oral deal with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have a sick woman's job certificate issued to your doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform workkeeping on medical grounds.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the absence of the employer.
There was an agreement to register the days as a holiday, but the agreement was only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not require it to have the employer's consent to take leave in writing, in practice this procedure has proved its worth.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
The alleged consent to the take-off of the leave may later be considered, as in your case, and the absence from work, to be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, thus a reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a lawsuit over an agreement with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled under Section 53, only you have given the days given on the credit note as an unexcused absence.
The unexcused absence from the credit note does not have the same consequences as Section 53 (e.g. the impossibility of receiving material unemployment security), yet the possibility of seeking a new job is made more difficult.
We recommend you to see your doctor again and have you confirmed in writing that there has actually been an accident that left you unable to work (this is not a so-called "discharge" to be a doctor).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and an early notification to the employer or to request written consent to take leave.
You avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a short distance past the halfway track of Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the boards for the second time after his right front tire blew up on lap 172, and the race was over for him.
Stewart brought the wrecked car to the garage, did not comment on the reporters, and left.
His team boss, Chad Johnston, said the No. 14 is disappointed, but will now concentrate on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I'd like us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart crashed into the fence for the first time in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required the right side of his car to be repaired.
"We had hopes of a good ending in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to leave.
After hitting and killing another driver at a race in New York, Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to catch up with the spot in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into the tragic accident in which the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into his path during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, working his way up to 10th at the start of the race and then even 4.
Then, at the start of the 122nd round, with Busch's No.
18, got out of control, came out of the second bend and crashed into Stewartov, sending both cars to the boards.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st.
Prague Seps New Offer Taxi, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxi service post administrators.
It receives around CZK 12.3 million annually for 103 parking spaces.
Until recently, it collected CZK 150,000 annually for the same taxi drivers' seats for the same seats.
This was reported by Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used a draw to select administrators.
The winner then received the lease for a flat-rate amount of CZK 1,000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer currently decides.
"A year from the termination of the original lease agreements and the start of tenders, the new rental system has been shown to be far more advantageous for Prague and, overall, fairer," the councillor says.
The most expensive job is Na Perštýně
The highest price was offered by those interested in the post in Na Perštýně street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million annually.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million were paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new leaseals of taxis were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and were terminated in the summer of last year with the original lease agreements.
The selection procedures were held in four waves and the new administrator was found with 29 posts.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all each time, creating a practically second pond around the hut.
Then we poured the Savo in.
Incredible stench!
Our well in the cellar always provided plenty of beautiful, fragrant water.
And that wasn't very expert, Grandpa scooped it with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was just three scrubs and generally quirky, as everything in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn't smell good.
We'd have to wonder if something fell in.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, there was quite a no-great-gone board, so the opening was seated with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, you couldn't see anything in the water, and we shone through it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
In the cellar, we noticed but strange things.
On the ground lay a sticky package with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And another one further.
Now it looked like a sunken mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are vents, Grandpa's invention, there were the remains of the fish!
And hard to ride!
Our cellar is quirky, too.
Some would say Grandpa just scratched the cottage.
And he would not be so far from the truth.
The wall and floor are only packed with sand, only the ceiling is undergrown.
It's mostly the boats.
And the wheels.
And deck chairs to the beach.
The doors with wide gaps were mostly open, as someone went all the way they went there in one piece.
At the ceiling, several of the aforementioned vents.
No net, so birds routinely fly in and they build nests on their rafters.
It is useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be flogged, and it did.
Now, of course, the luft didn't help.
The whole cellar stank.
So we cleaned the entire cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw out the things that were around: the boards, the henanigans board, and so on.
Our cottage was a long-distance welcome bystanders with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering who could have pulled the disgusting remains in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometres from here in the village.
She'd have a hard time coming to us to snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
Did he, the Franta, didn't he slip the nastiness in the vent?
He's here practically all year round, stupid ideas, he's the one.
We decided to watch the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far just for washing and washing before the tests are ready, but it was already good.
Pulling water from the forest well is nothing I want to do for a while.
We once heard the terrible anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Réza was bouncing over her and stinging like a fool.
Her mom scolded her because she thought Réza had dug out the drainage hose from the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially rolled into the ball and partially straightened up.
The balcony was hissed.
Réza had a hysterical fit.
We ran downstairs.
The snake, well over a metre long and as a bullshiner, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented her from doing so.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the snake saw the odds of our entire family, she probably told herself to eat it, if we were such a hungry one, and gracefully squealed the vent into the basement.
We flew after her.
Like a bolt of lightning, she jumped behind the well.
By the way, we've recorded another stinking package on her record.
The smell is probably a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a scourge.
And we logged the basement through the day.
That he would...
We went out and there we went to one of the vents.
We didn't expect long.
It rummelled under the well.
First there was a flat head with yellow moons on his neck.
Then the whole snake rose to the well.
She wrapped around the pump and began to break in.
The fired employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
The jilted employee, after being released, purchased the computer on the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money he raised before being detained by the police.
In a short time, the man had purchased a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"He took the nulbooky to Olomouc after the takeover, where he sold them in bazaars," said the Chief Commissioner of the Šumperk Police, Rostislav Brückner.
The fraud's motive was revenge against the employer for dismissal, as well as the profit of the money.
"In the interrogation, he told us that he had used the money to make the loans," Brückner said.
Police also discovered that the impostor was a pathological player who had been repeatedly treated in a psychiatric hospital.
The money could also end up in slot machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who has been convicted once for theft, now faces a prison term of one year to five years.
Officers have yet to say whether the bazaars, which the under-priced laptops have also been at risk of being punished and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking over brand new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner stated.
However, none of the bazaar's owners have yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you'll do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of route, which brought the destination to the float instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to live it a bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we took pictures together and made videos.
To perfect my view from the other side, I accepted the role of personal conductor.
Together with our friend Katya, we obediently joined the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends, who were passing by us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few sidekicks to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
The shouts of cheers, but instead of a quick start, it was followed by a scurrying to the starting line.
After five minutes we walk to the gate, turn on the measurements and break down at a rate of ten.
We wander with a yellow snake run by runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly descending sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad an almost kitsch-like tinge.
The densifying mass stretching along the waterfront looks as if the whole of Prague is running here.
Traditionally, on the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has how many strength.
A light hill in Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or go to walk.
Just before the run-up to the Theatre I see a police escort and right behind him, Vítek Pavlišta flies to the finish line.
I hear the admiring fuffled sigh of other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, cheer him up, he prepares to slap me, but just before that my foot gets twisted and our hands are just passing.
The Story of the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and breezak.
It takes, there are places ahead of us where the views will take my breath out.
A turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in the whole beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not in, and my feet are almost carrying me alone.
Behind the first refreshment is a moment of truth.
As the road is run, Katya stumbles a curb and performs a leap in a blend.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm launching a series of stimulating words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It rises and we continue with Goat's Lane, it's one of the narrowest places of the track, there is no such rush at this stage of the race, but it is still necessary to keep a good eye on the surroundings.
I do not yet know that the term of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of the other runners.
I try to applaud each other with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kata, too, because ten cuddles with the fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are speeding up again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the pursuit has started.
We're outranking dozens of runners as I pass someone particularly tired, I try to cheer them up with a few words: "Come on, a little more, you can do it!"
After the last refreshment room, we're not getting ahead of us, we're speeding up.
So far we've run for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometres to the finish will hurt, but you need to really work.
The sun has set its course and the end of the day is symbolically ending the race.
Last run to the bridge, a turn and just the straight to the finish.
The pace we're running amazes me, where does that come from in that girl?
"Come on, we'll go under an hour thirteen, we're working!" I call.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a goal.
An hour, thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can I do.
The coach set the limit for an hour of twenty.
So seven minutes to plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katya's legs are on, helping her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also luck from a well-done performance.
After a while, I slowly lead her out of the target's space.
The euphoria doesn't give us thinking about the crush in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
You can see here that Goat's Lane wasn't the narrowest point.
This is the float behind the goal, which is crammed to bursting under the onslaught of almost ten thousand runners.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for them.
I, too, is losing my head after a while, wondering if the gorgeous outlooks and the more interesting route compared to previous years was worth what was happening at the finish line.
I know from my own experience that hosting a race is no fun.
Add to that ten thousand people, a rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all traffic, it is a huge challenge.
This year's route change showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Spa was transferred to the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random spectators stepped up it on every metro of the track.
In the city's run through the historic centre, unfortunately, obstacles must be taken into account, which cannot be removed, but I do not consider the target of the mass race in a place that is bounded on one side by a wall and on the other by a river.
If I tell myself that the race ended with a run-in, I rate it as very good.
Behind the goal I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route as well and what do you say about the situation at the finish.
Prison guards in Bulgaria to organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff in the whole of Bulgaria participated in a national protest rally before the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have changed recently.
The list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister, Hristo Ivanov, also includes higher salaries.
Peacekeepers symbolically protested against the new working hours for the month, demanding a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the union of the prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still underway," said the head of the General Directorate of Prison, Rosen Zhelyazkov, of the General Directorate of Prison Service.
The protests of the prison staff are also expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe can be of more size and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University scored a hit on the spot in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible route for laymen to penetrate the heel of problems, which is now addressed by a number of theoretical physicists - an attempt to unify two superbly functioning but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (for at the moment, our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved in such an imaginative way that it is worth retelling even to the laymen.
In addition, Greene dealt with the complex material so fresh and engagingly that he could not be blamed for how many interesting things he had not included in his book.
Moreover, he misplaced his "mistake" for the most part in the next two books: the Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete more quickly, but the fact is that, even after 15 years, the Elegant universe still provides almost everything essential to what an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a bit more vicious in this area after all (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on a "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Green with the non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strangely or mystical.
Yet it is specific and completely acceptable.
To be sure, let's take our eyes from the universe as a whole to something of a more mundane, specifically to a long and thin, watering hose.
Imagine that you stretch the 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watch the whole scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance you can easily detect a long hose stretched in the horizontal direction, but if you are not suffering from the astrequency, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given your long distance from the hose, you'd think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension to walk in: a left-right dimension along the hose.
When asked where the ant was at the moment, you answer with just one indication: the distance of the antea from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometre distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has a thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - a widening hose in the shape of a circle.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known levo-right-determinate dimension along the length of the hose, but also in "direment in/on-direction in the direction of the clockwise" of the clockwise, i.e. around the circular cut of the hose.
You begin to understand that you must enter two numbers to determine the position of the small anteater: how far is the hose from the end of the hose and where there is a fogling hose on the gorchule.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (reported. Experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on the disorder theory of strings.
The non-protein aspects are discussed in Chapters and 13th chapters.
The hose surface is two-dimensional: one longitudinal dimension is shown by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coiled.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easy to see.
The dimension-encrying circuit of the hose is short, "worth-thin" and less noticeable.
To be aware of the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
The example in question illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
That they are divided into two groups.
They may either be large, vast and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, coiled and much harder to observe.
Of course, in that case, we didn't exactly get overboard to reveal the "wine" dimension of the hose's flay.
All you had to do was take the binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only have detected the coiled dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he drew the astonishing thought that the spatial geometry of the universe might have more than three known dimensions to all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical assertions on the grounds that the additional dimension provided an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory could be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately asked how this observation of Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the space.
The response Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls, claiming that the spatial geometry of our universe could have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, as with the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at any moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, tightly coiled into space so tiny that they have so far remained hidden from our most sophisticated experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer picture of the nature of Kaluza's remarkable proposal, let's stick with the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense series of circles on the circumference of the hose in black paint.
From a standpoint, the hose still looks like a fine one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will now reveal the coiled dimension even more easily, as we will see the theme from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, a combined four-spacesimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let's note the illustration on the giant.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we magnify the view of the geometry of space in the same way that we magnified the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge magnification of the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are coined to a sufficiently small space; that explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square network depicts the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle is a new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like loops of thread in densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in each place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them to the intersect in the square network for the illustration.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known space structure - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as the meters, viewed on the side of a small square in the square network.
In each of the following images, we focus on the small area of the picture before it; we magnify it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first levels of enlargement.
However, when we step forward on our way to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, shape-shaped circle of coiled dimens, similar to the loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension existed in each place in the direction of the large dimensions, as the hose has a circular circumference at each point of its length.
For the sake of illustration, we have drawn the circular dimension only in some of the regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 Kaluza and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the space's geometry is summarized.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-distant spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just an object within the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular coiled dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it is much heavier - like the circular circuit of the hose - to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be undone beyond the strength of our state-of-the-art augmentation tools.
But most importantly, the additional dimension is not merely a rounded bump within the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large size.
It is a dimension on the other three dimensions independent as the dimensions of the top-downs, from the left-right and from the front-to-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A sufficient small ante could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four data to determine its position, in addition to the usual three, a position in the circular dimension; if you count the time, the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, we find that, while we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of the space, Kaluza and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional coiled dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe may well have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structures of the large billionth of the billionth of the meter.
We can barely observe the smaller coiled dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be the size of approximately one of Planck's lengths, the size far behind the distinctive capability of today's devices.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions by Kaluzo-Klein's theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: episode 5th
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in a 12-act harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Whoever fumbles in music theory finds its principle detailed here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating the puppeteer and puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be tracked here, has made a living as a graphic artist since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which is said to be impossible to leave.
The guitarist is the father, as is Brother Matej, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start with the coaching on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, just apply it to a harmonic model of the 12," Honza says.
If you add another string, you can rotate the figure again.
Just listen to Honza and watch what can be invented with the 12-year harmony on two strings and how pretty it is already starting to sound.
If you take the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, beware of the change in the tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time Honza will return to the pentatonic and try to put it together with the 12.
So practice it honestly.
As best as best, you can read that in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school's electric guitar game here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, acknowledges Hradec Dvořák
We take the point and we are happy for it.
We had more chances for us in the first half," said the striker, who scored from the penalty spot this time.
Weren't you nervous at his mess, was he accompanied by a huge whistle?
I didn't particularly notice it, although it would have been worse for the second goal, where the home fans are.
You equalised with the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored a penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the start, we were passive, it came out of that corner and then a penalty after that.
After that, you got up and the first half you were the better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal scored a goal well.
We said in the booth that we wanted to keep the pace of the game after, but we couldn't do it.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it's probably also true that the home side said something about their game at the break, probably not very happy with it.
You only scored on the pitch for the first time, whereas at home you might not have scored a goal.
Why is it such a difference?
I wouldn't say it makes that much of a difference, it's up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzeň, that's a different category.
You waited for a goal for four games, weren't you worried that it could be similar after the last match?
Not really, but of course we're glad we haven't had to listen to talk about waiting for a goal since the last game.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet the big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
The lava to the surface in the Holuhraun area, near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a crater a kilometre away.
It is located under the glacier, as is part of the aforementioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday, (31 March.
2014) is still flying about the same amount of lava from the fissure.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could also be opened in places where it is found under the ice.
If this were to happen, with a similar intensity to the current eruption, it would be a huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and other rivers.
There is a strong smell of sulphur in the vicinity of the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also many more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no air in the area in the morning hours.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) for Bárðarbungu and yellow (third) for Askja.
The sky above Cheb was the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked the flanks
Aviation day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced to the aircraft acrobat Peggy Walentin, who climbed out of the cockpit from the cockpit to the front of the biplane on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There it is confined to the strength of the muscles.
The flying day in Cheb was the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare some interesting aerial pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "walked on the wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his shining cover.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the US.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to get ahead.
But because of the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the air days program.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit to the top wing after the start.
There he performs various exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, it will move into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," described Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organiser of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang fighter was a legendary icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter rushed to the desktop with the Grippen of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called numbers).
Such a line-up could be seen by aerial fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then demonstrated to everyone breathtaking acrobatics with the aircraft from 1945.
It was made during the war, but he probably never participated in it.
He was listed in the army reserve.
From 1963 he worked in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiste.
Also at the same site is another pearl of Cheb air day, the twin-encamped Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the mighty machine could not be overlooked.
His polished aluminum cover glowed in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force also gained anguish.
The small airliner caught off guard for the rendecessed Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from the German Hof on the air day.
German neighbours were shown in Cheb with the reconstructed aircraft of the Yak as the likes of the Bücker Jungmann biplane aircraft.
Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return to the camera!
The parents' worries were exchanged by Lucie Borhy, at least for the evening's work.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter clearly doesn't know any of this.
The TV news moderation was going well for her, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended up being a six-year-old in which women experience the most stress after giving birth.
Lucie, however, will not be shown regularly in the main news bulletin of TV Nova.
She will not be a regular return for another month, according to news server Blesk.cz.
After all, her daughter Linda now needs her more than the TV audience.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit.
Exhibitions a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, plans Jagr's bachelor party
It would be dignified if something like this was done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union goes about it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which the captivating Nagano team met again.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
Players would like to have a taste, wouldn't they?
Absolutely.
It would be good to do a farewell to the golden generation during the Championships.
I think you can find one or two days during the tournament when it's a full day off and where you can mingle such a match.
We'll tell Gum (Jiri Šlégro) or Ya's Shcherbane (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take charge of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play the New Jersey playoffs?
So if I come in...
Play in the national team, you don't want to.
Or did the Jihlava meeting alter your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and the performances are crucial in the national team.
It's one thing for people to like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have what it takes, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you really enjoy the Nagano reunion?
Just meeting the players was great.
You've brought up stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was a tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to be reminded of the history of our hockey and that is that one generation is really leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Do you still remember your first representative match yourself?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, came on in one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
Well, that we would in some way dominate, that's impossible to say.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hašek was catching for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hasek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to quit the national team).He just captured it excellently.
Even Hnilička was a great performer.
He was trained with me one night, and there was a jade.
And now he was catching famously.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the Socceroos start qualifying
The Smichov NH Hotel was visited by prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr Čech from Chelsea, the representative coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the character in the black baseball cap, that's Tomas Rosicky!
The Arsenal midfielder and the captain of the national team arrived at the meeting around 11:30 p.m.
We have a beautiful game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't look forward to it?" said when he had already appeared before the press in the representative set.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, 1st September: start of the reunion, first training session
Tuesday, 2 September: Training open to fans (18:30, Letná) Autographed (20:00)
Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday 9th September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of reunion
Rosicky and Co. can be supported by fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (20:15).
The team opened for them for them on Tuesday's training, which starts at 6:30 p.m. at Letná.
It will be followed by an autograph session, for which neither Rosický nor the Czech will miss.
Otherwise, of course, this national team reunion will be quieter.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who complained about the many social events in the spring.
Finally, we will address what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to rehearse things that there have not been so much time for," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Muetry image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three matches under Willow, all the preliminary matches.
With Norway and Finland, they drew 2-2 and lost 1-2 to Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's now.
The match with the Netherlands will kick off the qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
It would of course help the Czech team to manage the dress rehearsal against the USA.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," Willow agreed.
The only player in the 23-man nomination to have health problems is forward David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he failed to recover until Wednesday's match against the USA, coach Willow would call in one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a bad diagnosis, she thought she was going to die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that a bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMTs, because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that around 23,000 people in the UK are suffering from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in motoring such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
The disabled may also experience insensitivity or pain, the condition being untreatable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA) - a condition that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be confined to the wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell off every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with the other kids, and I was bullied at school for the way I used to walk and run."
When Rodgers was thirteen and was after several surgeries to release her Achilles' tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor's leave of the room and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, completely panicking.
I thought I'd end up in a wheelchair by the time I was 18, and by the time I was twenty-five, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone in it, and I was planning a funeral."
When she was seventeen, she realized that her grooming had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and asked her surgeon.
He just got up, hugged her, and said, "Sweetheart, I don't think you've got the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it's something far less life-threatening."
After passing several genetic tests, it was found to have a CMT.
"When he explained to me what the CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The charity CMT UK launched a month of informing the CMT to highlight the disease.
Entrepreneurs in Washington: tax rises with economic turnaround
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country increased slightly last year to restore the economy, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the 2013 fiscal year to the state and local coffers, up 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year in a row in 2009 and 2010, when taxes were falling.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political grouping Center on State Taxation, national taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is on a business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from the company.
Virginia, at 28%, shows the smallest tax revenue from the business in proportion to.
Researchers claim that the majority share of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of properties belonging to firms, which increased property taxes this year, with a rise of -1% of -1% in succession, up 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from major nations like California, New York, and Texas, the situation seems to be the same in Washington.
Last year, the companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes, a 4.2% annual increase compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the manifest increase in the value of real estate does not drive up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of the company's taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax accounts for nearly half of the state and local taxation.
"In Maryland, a lot of companies' properties are owned, most notably the tax base around the D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don't pay taxes," explained Douglas Lindholm, the executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to be increasing.
Companies in the region published a corporation tax of $2.3 billion, which increased from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing just as quickly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the increase in taxation was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three (all of which they have the same taxation) of the lowest corporate income tax.
The taxation rate of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a more favorable tax climate overall than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law lowering company tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, retail entrepreneurs in Washington are doing better, so they pay higher state and local taxes.
A business tax paid by small business owners as a personal income tax - the structure of offsetting the cost increases by raising prices, according to which most firms are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose 20% to $2.4 billion last year, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers claim that the trend and nationwide increase in business tax are likely to continue next year, with total tax revenues from sales for both state and local governments to increase to 6.2% compared to the same period in the previous year's first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may lag behind others, as state spending cuts are taking their toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Europe's head will be Tusk, Putin's Novorum and Lafat scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for negotiations on Novorum
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government troops have been clashing with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European firms that, following the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the warfare of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, he argues, contradicts democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he said, depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
Czech Republic wins right to disagree with part
The European Commission, along with diplomats, is to propose a further tougher on anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
The permanent chairman of the meetings of the member countries, Herman Van Rompuy, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, the concrete proposals for a shift in the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU's "president."
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU president who directs the summit meetings of the member states.
From December, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years.
The head of European diplomacy will be succeeded by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, for European diplomacy.
The Italian woman, who will become vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament in office.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is just not mentioned
Help an incurable and long-term suffering patient with the departure from life?
In Czech conditions, where the laws do not permit euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Yet the comments made by the doctors who approached the LN show that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The Hardest Chapter for Neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
Approximately three hundred people suffer from the Czech Republic's amyothophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with 21 patients undergoing experimental stem cell treatment in Motol, Prague.
We don't know for a hundred percent whether it will be successful.
But if we don't try it, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a Motol neurologist.
It shows the CIA manuscript, they needed a war, Huml writes about the downing of MH17
ČSSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the hilarious sanctions that were announced with regard to the downing of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the lawmaker, the CIA's handwriting is also familiar.
Unfull promises.
Elections are coming and the parties once again offer the impossible
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for each family and a cable car above Prague.
It is repeated before every election: parties promise the impossible.
Also, with the local elections approaching, politicians are racing to see who the voters will be more happy about.
Lidovky.cz has selected the impossible promises of the present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque.
A fierce siege began
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander, Alois Liška, consistently asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and listed the ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SUMMARY: Plzeň leads the league in front of Prague's "S", Liberec declassified by Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader in the Football League, which is one point ahead of the two Prague "S".
The changes at the top of the table were caused by the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, beating Jablonec thanks to two Lafatov's hits.
Liberec scored a record win of the year, scoring 6-0.
62,000 spectators at the volleyball?
Poles say yes
The opening of the Volleyball World Championships in Warsaw brought a spectator record.
At the football stadium under the cloudy roof, 62,000 spectators watched the home side's smooth win over Serbia.
The tickets were sold out in 100 minutes.
How to survive the return from a holiday?
Take your time and sleep
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Get used to getting used to getting back from a sunny beach or cottage for a normal work rate can be a challenge for many.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: not to take a chance to get in and out of quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: 'Fingers in the FT)
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days, ever since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she was not losing hope of the 83-year-old comedian's recovery.
"Thank you for your greeting and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
Fingers to my fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency services, according to which she was at cardiac arrest on Yorkwill endoscopy on the Upper East Side, according to a source.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedative and under close supervision until they are confident of her condition, which remains "serious."
The reactions were not long in coming, including the surreal support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is twisted headlines
That the media distort reality with their headlines is not (sadly) news.
I know that the headlines are "sold" in the paper, but unfortunately I also know that many are so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, the word is more apt.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It is common for the headlines "Israel attacked Gaza."
You will only read in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a response to the fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the truce declared.
This then appears the headline "Both sides violated the truce."
Does the journalism community realise that, in this process, it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic positions that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
Less than sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are survivors of the Shoah.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish swine" and similar misfits, I got a kick out of it.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realise the fact that after the Jews the Slavs were destined for the liquidation?
Ladies and gentlemen, the press, please pay a little more care to your work.
You are often described as the "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
While he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
What would you like to see our government do if one of our neighbors decides to eliminate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the world map?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs live in the territory of the state of Israel with Israeli citizenship.
And they're comfortable there.
If you ask them, why don't they go between "the "his," like to Gaza, answering you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch health care (I've seen for myself with my own eyes how to go to the top private Hadassa Hospital, which is funded by the sponsorship donations of Jews from all over the world, and are, of course, treated).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with their missiles.
The only real aid to Gaza, and thus to this restless area, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Learn about Hamas's practices, about exploiting people as human shields.
To inform Hamas that Hamas aims to eliminate the state of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Notify that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organisations.
To learn that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the area may have been thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the governors of Gaza do not pay and even fret that the power supplies are sometimes cut off at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide attackers could infiltrate the territory of Israel, but perhaps in the construction of housing, hospitals, and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived considerably better.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion for Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the information's claim on Monday morning: An online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion.
The announcement was a surprise not because no one expected the Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected to be YouTube.
Three months ago, the one-billion-dollar Twitch sale of a Twitch looked certain, and that connection looked natural.
Twitch, who founded Justin.tv only three years ago, was on track to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online game broadcasts to it - the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live-streamed gaming."
Interapacation Twitch.
The "Let's play" video, the kind where the sages (mostly older) give games Mystery Science Theater are already popular, with the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up a lot when you're describing the Trawitch, so the news that YouTube is buying a Twitch didn't get too excited, it was a textbook example of how the established company would pay off possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube failed, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have at our disposal is the comments of Twitche CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, it has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us deliver it faster."
Another mystery is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they'd rather do sport than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about just watching games instead of playing.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m., playing Resident Evil, and it's all very different to watch a stranger get 20 hits to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of the player, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that the speed run-like games in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic time will complete the game in record time are entertaining.
But if someone is not a master of playing or humor, their Twitch channel is unlikely to be very interesting.
But what do the skeptics like I know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth at the height of online traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of that?
It's hard to imagine the Twitch tapping into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed up by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As CEO Twitch Shear, both Amazon and Twitch have said, and the media don't seem to be reluctant to viewers, or - swallowed - viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme of "Hateful Scriptures are God's Word."
Attached to the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often confront us with the question: Who are you going to believe?
A supposed word of God or the word of man?
As if human exploration were completely trivial compared to the authority they imagine that their doctrine has.
But when they say "human," they talk about science.
And when they report to the "words of God," they report to the myths of a god written by people.
If, indeed, there is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then he is the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be he who supplied other pieces of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Otherwise, why would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulously.
And it was the people who wrote all the lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not by the gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of the angels, but those texts were not written by none other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and certainly not gods.
If there really was one real god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergennius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only script of the saint.
It would have been known all over the world, without its predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors would not be able to compete with such a work.
And people would not have to believe it in blindness, for it would be consistent, substantiated by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to be unfriendly to share faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn't expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the one religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, and all of them are constantly disintegrating into more and more separate denominations, seeking contentious truths, and each claiming God's leadership in some way, regardless of the continuing dissolution and separation in every way.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Qorda'ul-'loth'Kitab-i-Akdás, Zarathushur's Avests, the Sikh-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and "rearcribed word of the only true god" and the respective believers of each of them say that the others are awning outliway of them, the other believers say the other ones are awning timery of the other..
The only logical explanation is that everyone is astray to some extent.
None of the aforementioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have the evidence support, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of West Michigan.
I'm not saying I've proved the Bible is reliable and historical accurate.
Of course he's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apologies (obhajubs), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive images once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfilment of the prophecy - with the fact that each may also contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions, impressions, and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudices bound by politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it contradiction, rather the comments made by each other.
We must once again point out that here we have two different authors whose work has somehow been mixed together during some editor's review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author, and he is certainly not the narrative of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, i.e. the five Books of "Moseswean" and do not attribute the authorship to Moses, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezdrah) from several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as her believer thinks.
The Dead Sea scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of zooroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Helénism, Druid cults, or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by docels and ebionites and their very different insights into Jesus, which were eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups as luciferians were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these edits refers to the king of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers were a major threat to the young mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule, and Ba'al Zebula, "the Lord on the mountain" changed to Beelzebub "The Lord of Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what happened to the New Testaments were canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commissions decisions at the Nikai Assembly.
The four Gospels were taken, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple handshake, as if the fact of the matter could be accepted or rejected by the vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers at the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after the Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about in the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved into this way from the primary church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they had consciously taken more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were reported by the books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items, we find the writings of both the Apostles and the Prophets.
Why should the word of God refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if God was the true author of this random slob of rumors, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by the people and certainly not by the enlightening, rather the opposite!
This is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically quite wrong, no matter what it is, almost from start to finish.
We are talking about people who believed snakes and donkeys could speak, believing in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would heal them of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were rumored and bats were fuzzy, and whales are fish and they know it's an integer.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, did not know this.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, then it would not have contained the kind of mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would not contain anything at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, the abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, looting, slaughter, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they were doing God's will.
But the creationists are still ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is at odds with the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other is the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worship of creation instead of the creator."
But they themselves see the word of man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the rebuttal of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refute the god as such.
Not their version of God but all versions of God.
Kreacionist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that a god might exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were a god himself because they think they're the word for HIS.
But the god never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people approved or rejected into their supposedly "immutable word" of any god was invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, edited and often also intentionally altered and twisted by mere flawed people.

Participant of the bucket challenge dislocated her jaw
As she poured icy water on her head, Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so hard she had damaged the facial bone structure.
This bucket challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed at the bucket call by dislocating her jaw.
While she poured icy water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged the bone structure in her face.
"The water was so cold I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen," she told The Mirror.
A 20-year-old girl pours water on herself.

I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, it was stuck, and I realized something was up.
Then it came to us and to my sister, they could have been bursting with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room quickly."
The 20-year-old had to be hospitalized to return her jaw to her original location after attending a fashionable viral wave on Tuesday.
The video became an online sensation, with thousands of people sharing it on Facebook and Twitter.
Attacker stabbed nine people at Chinese school, three of whom died
A man named Chen, according to the New China News Agency, violently entered the building of the elementary school and attacked around 10:30 p.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen eventually killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has seen a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in line with the government's policies.
Zeman showed first-time women in Lány how he had to sit at school
The smallest schoolchildren were taken by ninth graders to their class, where he and the teacher waited for the president to come.
He then demonstrated to the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that doesn't expect you anymore, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first-years to the first-grader as a gift.

Education Minister Marcel Chládek started the new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport more," he said, explaining one of the reasons why he went to the north of Bohemia on his first day of school.
He was approached by the school's management some time ago at a hockey match in Litvínov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the start of the school year," the minister added.
Education Minister Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
The first classes were joined by 115,000 first-graders this year.
A total of over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Education Ministry estimates.
Nova's new director of news coverage is David Fiala
The new arty director of Nova's news and journalism from Nova has become David Fiala since 1 September.
He will succeed Alan Zárubu, who led from the 1. June the creative department of the entire Nova group.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of the news television Z1.
For the past two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he has been involved in the realization of a complete visual transformation of the news broadcasts Televizní noviny, Střepiny, Bang! and other publicist programmes by Nova.
David Fiala has a very good command of the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and graphics department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a flair for the typography and a clean, elegant design, which is the way we want to go further in Nova's visual coverage," says Nova's creative director, Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbs to hackers, with nude images of celebrities released public
Screen sheet with a listing of leaked files
An anonymous user on 4chan is publishing nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the US website Mashable.com pointed out.
They were reportedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where disabled users uploaded them by automatically backing them uploaded to images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the problem.
Some celebrities reject the pictures as forged, but several of the images in question have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, a friend of her thelor-winning role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in the 'Midricain Trap 4.0, for example.
The aim of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
American magazines reportedly showed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker wants money from the community instead.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a weakness in the security of iCloud.
In fact, a tool appeared on the GitHub server two days ago to get passwords to the user's accounts through brute force, i.e. automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was demonstrably working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the instrument was released.
As a precaution, iCloud users should thus change their password associated with the Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The leak of nude images of celebrities considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are secure many times better than computers in homes or smaller firms, upload of sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also sensible to set up the automatic backup of photos from your phone to take place only on wi-fi and when connected to the charger.
This way, you'll be able to move the sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you'll have the space to delete the missed images, so they won't take up space unnecessarily in the online repository.
We offer a guide on how to encrypt files and communications on the internet to readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaire Valášek in the PDF format.
A clever way to save on a college script
With the price for a college script for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books by classmates from senior class with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their deregone.
"I earned a book for calculations that normally cost $180 for the semester in ten and for chicken nuggets," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The bookbooks required for his last semester would cost $430, he says.
Spent 120.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different ways to handle the expenses.
The preferred choice of students is becoming online shops and creative solutions like Schroeder's.
The rise is on the rise of borrowing textbooks, allowing students to use the book for the semester, often at a significant discount, rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 bookstores in campus sites, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A review in the sector shows that around a quarter of the books in the university bookstore were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought at university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Businesses.
Here's the 101st of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower online than in the university's bookstore.
The recommended award for the ninth edition of Rone Larson's "Calculus," with Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler, is almost $290, but it can be purchased at Chegg.com, in retail, for $23.99, for $23.99, at Chegg.com, in retail.
Buying used
If you don't mind other people's comments or wear and tear and vandalism, the appropriate option is the curriculum used by the curriculum.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid a copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" for a used extraction of 42 cents.
The new one sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students at their teachers check to see if the older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes to work in semen aren't important.
If so, older releases can be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering lending textbooks, if you treat them well, remember to return them and you don't need to have them even after the seminary.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for the entire semester for about $20.
Get to know the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including a penalty for notes, highlights or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic licence valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the most advantageous offers can be found by literary course students, as many of the classics are now available for free downloads, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, go to the stores.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be soon at the Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN, as it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order the book online, make sure it's really in stock, advises Gault.
He made sure of it firsthand.
The book he had bought was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for a book from a university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found in the well the torso of a rifle from the end of the war
The well is a short walk from St. George.
We uncovered the foliage around and began to pull out an aged trek - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay day, we came upon the barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it to be the torso of an assault German rifle that was used by SS troops.
The discovery is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were made only towards the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novák added.
All the wooden design items have decomposed over time, so it is unusable.
Her body, however, is well preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it come to be in the well?
There is an explanation.
It may have been thrown in by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS, probably for fear of being relegated.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were dumping their weapons in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts from the Rainbow Hogs of the Jeseníky Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them around here once, so we slowed the excavation work, we felt the mud carefully to avoid any misfortune, but nothing else was down there," Novák said.
The discovery will end in the depository of the museum at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not freed the Prudent Czech yet
Aktuálně.cz's exclusive interview with General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, which liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take it... they're calling me from Donetsk," excused the Ukrainian-colonel-designon Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the director of the Centre for the Liberation of War prisoners there, in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear from the names of the people, their numbers, or where they were - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, again addressing ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests in the Maidan.
Yesterday - when we were arranging an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number up to 30.
But there may be many more.
Have you met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed the already captured Serbs, the Dagestans, the Chechens, the Shows, the Georgian... but not yet a Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we came across your captured countryman and can rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who are joining the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers will capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they are fighting in the Ukrainian banners of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after being questioned, as will any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be rented mercenaries, who claim nothing deserves nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and therefore a Czech among them - they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy just survives.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many of the Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
As I understand it, in exchange.
Some sources say it has long since passed a hundred men.
We've long since stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... they didn't save them from the war if they decided to continue the fighting.
The rescuers are doctors in the war, the surgeons, but we are definitely not.
That's it.
And every day, more and more are added.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes a quartet or a five.
And it doesn't always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes all it takes is enough to release the prisoners and a mere human request.
A.cz: It is rumored that you have won great authority and even trust with the pro-Russian separatists in a few months... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of the two warring parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "a madman general with steel balls."
It's not offended.
And perhaps it captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers Corps, I had gained some authority before.
I never catch, I don't cheat and always keep my word.
Whatever is happening, I'm being honest and telling the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk very unpleasant one.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, I even got captured in the prisoner exchange... this job can be the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know about?
... (long pause)... to torture the prisoners, both Ukrainians and separatists are resorted to the torture of prisoners during interrogations.
Unfortunately.
And the executions?
These take place only on the Donetsk side.
I do not have information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Nor hints about the Ukrainian military committing such a thing.
We have an idea about the number of executions, but I can't and I don't want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are striving for autonomy and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their impassimable opponents - to the death.
As we say - they've gone over to their throats.
The same dreams and aspirations were made by the way of maroan.
And now I'm filling in a bit: Russia supports the separatists, and the West, on the other hand, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be a big one, and the other one is small.
But this line of mine already holds an impregnitable contradiction.
A.cz: How, for example, does one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler, appear to you?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm unarmed and show soldiers or militants their bare hands outstretched.
And I've always got both sides of the two or three hundred meters in the sights or in the optical sight.
The faces of the people who point to me, I can see well every time... and they can pull the trigger of their guns at any time.
A privilege, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just as a small governorate in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he talks about it all the time, and sees Ukraine as a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state, he said, should not even exist.
He is also an implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the Ukrainian TV's discussion show, you called your Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred yards of walking, I get at least five times scared.
So why should I be hiding with the view that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and is hurting our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a part in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians dub Yatsenyuk the "rabble."
And the rabbit is not, in the eyes of Ukrainians, an animal that would be afraid of or would have respect and authority in others.
His behavior is directly replicating the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament in war, to beg, to play with him, to play his intrigue, to threaten to lay down a post ... he must run the country, administer it and, in times of war, protect it.
At the threat to the country, the prime minister is not entitled to family, his friends, rest on tearful emotions.
He is the first of the ministers of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the sales
Sylvester Stallone's upspired of a $90 million budget in the US and Sin City: A Women for whom I would have returned only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz grossed only $14.6 million on its first weekend, as well as films for children like How to Train the Dragon 2 were a disappointment to the cinema.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, the quality of their very aches are to blame for children's films.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's films, and he called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to the films put on a slightly older target group, the problem does not seem to be necessarily in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average rating of summer film premieres aired in at least 2,000 cinemas between the victims' Day of the War and the 20s. July in 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the view of both viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewers' approach and the higher popularity of internet sites like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's treatment of the Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase at what was already.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood box office, Netflix's profit has reached $1.2 billion thanks to internet services, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying on the rights to comic books too much, and predicted the "giblings" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slump, some commentators claim that there may be something to it about its catastrophic prophecy.
With the launch of possible major box office hitters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoňů and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in sales as simply "cyclical." Speaking to the Hollywood, the Reporter said, "Next summer will be the summer's biggest box-office blockbusters in history, and no one will worry about selling."
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul announced.
The missile's alleged test was carried out shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as preparing for the invasion.
The province of Zhagang is in the northwest KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry told DPA that the missiles were launched from a place in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
As a result, North Korea apparently fired a missile from Zhagang Province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to be an underground launch pad for Scud rocket rockets.
This is another in a series of similar trials conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were conducted by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in central Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had come from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenagers were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night at the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike to the Govetts Leap in Blackheath after noon on Sunday.
When they did not return home, the anxious relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search crew, including a local police and a rescue team, were dispatched, and the couple were found at around 11pm near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head in the process.
The police officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable condition, they were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on the leg of Vasicek
The 23-year-old could have made the decision, but failed in the two best chances.
The goal was called mainly by a shot from close range three minutes before the end, but instead of in the net, it ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava, Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give those chances.
I'm angry with myself," Vasicek said, pouring the ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it higher under the lid, it got a little bit off," he mused.
Sigma's defense did not allow Opava much, with the exception of Mikul's 11th-minute drive, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then they started to push Hanáci, but they were not allowed to the chance in the block defending the home side and the shots from the distance were caught by Květoň.
We compared ourselves for 15 minutes, then took the initiative.
We were better in the second half, we had more of the game and Opava only threatened us from the standard situations.
But the outright chance was not converted by Vasicek, and it ended 0-0," said the coach of the Hanák team, Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point due to absences from the line-up, where in addition to the pair of injured, Petr Vavřík and the three-goal scorer Petr Ševčík, who are hosting from Sigma in Silesia, were missing.
Unlike her earlier policy, she did not allow them to step in.
The alternates deserve discharge.
Sigma was more football-wise, but except for one standard we didn't let her do anything," Silesian coach Petr Baránek said.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and belligerence to see.
The draw is probably well deserved, the point is a good gain for us," he added.
Sigma drew to four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the club's chief executive, Josef Lébro, who, after defeating Znojmo, made his million-dollar deposit to the coffers conditional on vastly different performances in other matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so there's no question of the guys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding to the sleeping shooter Vasicek: "I believe it will come and when he scores, he'll start to fall in.
But after the first shot, I will immediately replace him with goals to save goals for the next games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice thrilled Venice.
Film Festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After the huge enthusiasm for the opening film, Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárrit suddenly became aling for the Golden Lion, the next days suggested the impression that interest in the 71st Venice Festival had faded somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest room rose to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critics of the acclaimed but less appealing for the audience, such as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s Look of Silence and other films with social themes from American 99 homes to Iranian's Tale, in cinemas, in short, the cinemas remained empty seats.
Heroes of the Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet worn the crowds as in the past, and it has reportedly stopped getting the problem of getting a last-minute job in the hotel.
The crisis is discussed in Italy more than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has suffered such esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the world's oldest film festival.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but present only in connection with the films.
While younger fans yearned for autographs by comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who had successfully performed dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was a visit by the legendary actor Ala Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In the story of a below-the-competition rendered by Oscar-winning Barry Levison, based on Philip Roth's novel, the 74-year-old Pacino has a role close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from the depression of the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him the next day as the eccentric owner of a scrapie from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, made by David Gordon Green, it was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actor should not miss it - but does the Pacinova-shape format still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian in particular, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proudly proclaimed to the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
Indeed, it is the Italian film that is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film with a rewarded long standing ovation after Birdman.
The Calabria branch of the mafia is viewed by the view of the family's relationships between the clans, which struggle for each other's power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, a camera, music and antennae.
He was also intrigued by the chamber psychothriller The hunger heart, who was filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost kills her own child with her misguided anxiety.
In contrast, French competition films did not receive a warm welcome either the Fame Prize, or 3 hearts, both of the works clinging to the traditional model of consumerist films that rely on the popularity of the performers.
But, after all, two really excellent films, that is, Birdman and the Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And while the festival films have mostly depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, The She's Funny That Way, a witty comedy out of competition in Venice and shot in the style of American '40s' crafts, was able to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police officers catch four meth producers in Prague, brought the drugs from Poland
"Detacters have detained three men in the past few days, aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who manufactured and sold the drug of meth in Prague 9 from last November until this August," police spokesperson Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, a SWAT team in Cihlářské Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a delivery saleswoman.
The following day, the detectives detained another member of the group on the basis of the prior approval of the prosecutor, a 37-year-old man.
The last of the four was captured by police officers in the early hours of 20 on Wednesday, August 20, in the area of the picturesque incinerator," the spokesperson described.
For transporting drugs from Poland, the woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of effect.
In the workshop of the ticketed area, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevova Street and other places in Prague 9, he produced meth, provided various aids and chemicals needed to make it to manufacture and provided transporting drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the manufactured drug, divided into plastic bags and subsequently sold the meth.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or selling the addicts, he was helped out by a 25-year-old, hitherto unpunished woman.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rösslerová added.
Criminals also conducted several house searches under the order of the judge, where they secured the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubes and other aids and items that, according to the experts, can be considered as a complete feature for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995
"From the available records, officers discovered that the main organizer had been convicted of property crimes in total seven times since 1995, the woman was not being convicted," the police spokesperson said.
The last detainee was in 2006 suspended for the offence of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old mechanic who is at large who is on the loose has been convicted nine times since 2009.
For him, too, it was mostly for property crimes.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with committing the offence of illegal manufacture and other handling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
For three persons, the investigator eventually filed a motion to the prosecutor to issue the detention, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old repeat offender, ended up at large.
His position and role in this case were not as fundamental as those of the other accused.
Police officers continue to work with this man anyway.
Ferrari offers chess of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things as part of its other products for a lot of "interesting" prices.
A good example will be used in Italy for handmade chess with a musictop of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than £40,000.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer acquires a set of wooden black and red lacquered figurines placed in a wooden box coated with carbon fibres.
It may come as no surprise that instead of a classic rider, the players have a figurine of a rearing pony.
If chess doesn't seem to be a worth enough gift, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (hand by hand) on a scale of 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
The abolition of grammar schools and secondary schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and the statistics show that grammar schools have a good application.
The start of the school year is here.
Schools have been in high training in the last fortnight.
Most are routine matters, like bringing the pots from the summer repository back to the classrooms and getting the chalk.
In the grammar school, they'll be a little more busy.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment as well as library literature.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year high school in Hořice opens and is restoring its activities after three years.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by the enrollment in the register of schools administered by the MEYS.
"French socialists should shut up and fix France," says Francois Hollande's key ally
Valls calls for the highly fragmented left to "show up its support" to the belligerently attuned socialist president, whose new division of functions was not met with the consent of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, drawing applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French 30-hour working week, despite the passionate conjecture of Emmanuel Macron, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had proposed that the rules be relaxed at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain "cooperative" with the government.
But Christiane Taubirova, the Minister for Justice, drew a line under his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious socialist parliamentarians, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "Frenchouis losing faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes between the Socialists when she said that she did not anticipate that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is too. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
It reiterated its party's call for dissolving Parliament and said it believed that the party could win an early election and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party runs the risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of the 2017 Hollande term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new Socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for an opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer be cut off by Prague until the election
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new capital management.
Other gambling establishments will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the local elections, and the city will not restrict street art.
Nor will the dog walk restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the council by the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which is ending its mandate in a few weeks," said Councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The abolition of land land-based gambling has been decided in the past weeks by several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But the gambling hall will not disappear, the gambling decree will not be changed yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the election.
We would not have made it technically now, given the time limits for submitting comments, and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, would take place on 11 September.
A referendum on the blanket ban on gambling is planned on the local elections of the city districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling in, for example, Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not be changed for the same reasons in the case of street art, so-called busking.
This is particularly complained about by Prague 1, which has already sent the Municipality a proposal for places to extend the current list of banned places.
The musicians are also not wanted by Prague 5 in the vicinity of Anděl.
The decree regulating the dog walker is planned by the city for several months, not yet completed.
The placement of gaming rooms and the issue of busking are dealt with by the city ordinances.
They can be issued or modified only by the city council.
Councils have only a consultative vote, they are not allowed to issue ordinances themselves.
Last week he placed the victory for proponents of Scottish independence at his fingertips' grasp
The Scottish Independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake a third time when it almost put the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you don't get to the hearts of the Scottish electorate by appealing to their wallet, or get their respect when you start threatening them.
The Morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a much more inclination to banner the moneymen from the temple than to have them dictated to vote.
The head of the Scottish Nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this well, which is why he repeatedly asked his opponent, the Unionan Darling, in a televised discussion, whether he was willing to respect the 'sovereign will of the Scottish people's people's 'superfits' if Scottish voters would vote for independence, and to start supporting the single currency for both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he grimned him in this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate's mandate.
However, the discussion about Scotland's currency was already more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defence of the state health service that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London bankers in the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of the health service.
The way Salmond put it, "he got into bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the association of "bosses," to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron thus looks like a cowardly absentee domestic.
Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a 'successful independent country'.
Alistair Darling can't say that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots are not supposed to jump out and have to accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
The pessimistic start of the school by Miloš Urban
Illustration for the shortest year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end of the holidays was the best ever, the last week that was going nowhere and just lounging around and wallowing with the Indian summer, the silence before the storm, the peace before the stress.
New clothes when you could get from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the tenth time, the tock on his bike up the mountain around the Imperial to the back of the Vars, somewhere near the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun caressing back and shoulders, tapping the farewell rays.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a holiday regimen, not until half-past ten, in a week it would be worse, the moment before falling asleep would stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then to get up at 6:30 in the morning.
It's Monday.
It doesn't usually rape, on the contrary, summer is maliciously sneered in front of the school.
To be glided in the ghostly light on the patch and feel like a plastic figure in a glass-mass, there's the school, the A.
Zápotocký with monstrously pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces a few new faces, boys more extensive, girls more boorish.
There are the punk, to avoid them, it's still interesting how infallibly they keep together and how early they are here.
And these mature-looking girls who came in for the jinxed are laughing at something now, I guess something changed in their lives over the holidays, whereas with me everything is the same.
And the new first-graders, some the nervous and the others, why are they coming in at all?
Because they have to, the educational military obligatory.
So inward, cool floor humidity and light smell of disinfectant, a poisoned janitor with a mop, unfortunately, always the same one who is said to lend the pupil's sheet key from the tin cabinet, where you can leave the textbooks and which are still so little.
For a bottle.
The smell of locker room remains in the memory, now it is not held, it is pretty airy, but in a week it will be worse.
The image alone clenches the stomach and a headache begins to ache.
A head that finds it even worse to embrace the maths lesson, that diabolical game for the elect, which I am not and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, forbid, fives, hide from rehearsal, fit in front of the rehearsal, and best to be grumble, to be there even if not to be, to exist only as a name in the classroom and to dream stories about the nicer girls and prettier buildings, about the antennas in the space, where no one competes with anyone, marries anyone, and doesn't undermine anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She let the daughters born die.
She faces exceptional punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilets in the bus station in Jihlava.
She had a baby girl, who after being cut from the umbilical cord, was born, hid under her jacket, and hid under her jacket and carried it to the road feeder, where she put it down into the bushes located a few dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier, I suppose.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I felt the need to go to the bathroom, that's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors, which I wore to the school," the defendant described, stating that she was said to be ashamed of the pregnancy.
"The following day returned to the site, put the child's body in her backpack and took her body away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped in a black plastic bag and hid and left under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havlíčkův Brod," the lawsuit reads, noting that it is not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after giving birth, suffocating by a blanket or putting under a jacket, hypothermic or bleeding to death from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next spring.
The woman at the undetected time from February to April 12, when the child's corpse was found by accidental witnesses under a bush at a pond in Havlíčkobrodsko, was again secretly born.
This time in the bathroom of a loft apartment in the family home.
Without checking to see if it had been born alive without cutting and subtracting the umbilic that was wrapped around the neck, she put the child in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Subsequently, in the afternoon, he and his then-partomate took him to the pond.
She was eventually turned in by a friend
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who was allegedly unaware of his partner's pregnancies.
For that reason, too, he is not now in court, he has only been punished for a transgression of the law on the funeral parlour.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like the fact that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He tamed the child against my wishes.
I know my solution was wrong, but it seemed human at the moment," said the indignation of the defendant, who was allegedly succumbing to and fearing the man in the relationship.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke rather evenly.
The tears in her eyes were only brought to her eyes by the moment she spoke of the relationship with her parents, from whom she had left after reaching the age of majority.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to see me every 14 days for a visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't get a kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I was going to put him in a babybox for the time, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can't explain that to you," she told the judge.
However, she denied acting with the thoughtfulness and intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, she claimed, was also believed to have been stillborn.
But even in pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also restricted smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was evident in both cases, she told everyone, even to repeated questions, that she had a medical condition, that she was waterlogged.
And my friend.
The trial will continue at the Hradec court on Tuesday with the testimony of forensic experts.
A verdict could already be handed down on Wednesday.
The woman is at risk of a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise approaches $3 billion buyout of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world's third largest cruise boat operator, in a negotiation to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
Trade by Norwegian Cruise, a market value company of $6.8 billion that competes with greater competition from Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and the Carnival Corp (CCL.N) have given access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and the wealthy clientele.
The deal may be made public as early as this week, the source revealed on Sunday, but pointed out that the negotiations may not be successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Torah-based in Miami operates thirteen cruise ships in North America, the Mediterranean and Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company announced sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% more than in the previous year.
The twenty-nine billion-dollar cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies like China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete to make them the preferred option for choosing cruises for these customers.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offer with the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has had a majority stake in the company since 2007 of the close of the deal worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has been in existence in its current form since 2000, when the merger with the cruise operator owned by the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise liner, a consortium of leisure and casinos-speaking companies, was inspected by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed the shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a capital holding of 28%, Apollo 20% and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.
According to the registration documents, the first public offers include 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities the day after vote decision
Nearby stood a group of people loyal to Beijing, who were waving the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress approved on Sunday that only two of the three candidates would participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointment committee, which is likely to be made up of members of the faithful Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot papers and get pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial center with the protests of the "Opening of the Center" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, with Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will be extended to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report outlining China's official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the special official district elections, and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, Zhang Ronghsun, and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong Affairs and Macau Feng Wei, were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Studensk activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government's office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations on "state sovereignty" with eastern Ukraine
According to a description of the events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked on Sunday for the Ukrainian government to halt the fight with the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the secreted areas of the secreted regions.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin's comment had not intended to indicate that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be overturned to give the Russian-speaking area the authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponds to the obvious strategy that has followed since the unrest broke out five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and inform the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared Novorum to de facto independence so that it can ally with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to reclaim the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken over by the separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists described the recently occupied territory as "Novorum" or "The New Russia," a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency has published Putin's words that the "prisoner of the ILO" is anyone who believes that peace negotiations are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians started before the parliamentary elections on the 26th. campaigns in October, while government troops are attacking the civilian population in areas controlled by the separatists.
"In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately launch meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also about the political organisation of society and the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of the broader autonomy, which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for months, to allay the concerns of Russian-speaking areas of danger to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government could grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin spokesman to correct the "unitly interpretation" of Putin's remarks highlighted the approach of Russia's leadership to address the separatism uprising in the east, which is different from the open seizure of Crimea, where most of the two-million-strong population of origin is ranked as ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also have much more trouble to annex Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and the polls that took place before the conflict have shown broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed in international fora, would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin effective control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the headquarters of Russia's main naval fleet, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea, Russia, are also the centre of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during his inauguration speech of 7. In June, he proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
But this vision of autonomy differs considerably from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's final call for Kiev to deal with the separatists as equals followed the rebel's next move last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Sea of Azov infiltrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened the huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We're approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
The territory of Ukraine now houses thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for additional sanctions to be taken against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region to support the besieged separatists last week.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovaysk in the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured in the hinterland of Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The scandal with the exposed photos is also implicated in Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate pictures of his fiancée, Gabi Grecko, and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit pictures of Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar on the Internet in the biggest scandal with hacked celebrity photos.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos with the nude star Hunger Games Lawrenc and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The iCloud leak reportedly made public personal pictures of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, told online newspapers, according to the online news reporters, that the hacking was "shame-day" and those who have become his target "falling humiliation."
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 pictures of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots topless at the pool.
Palmer starred in Love and Honor, where Liam Hemsworth was her counterpart.
Palmer, TV series star Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning, did not comment on the stolen pictures yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence TMZ said: "This is a clear privacy violation."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter feed: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal standpoint, the publication of the stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma's players made up for the Lébra, even without a win
Olomouc - Thunder and lightning, which the co-owner of Olomouc Sigma, Josef Lébr, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
Although they brought from Opava in the end only a point in a scoreless draw.
By deploying and belligerence, they made the club's boss a little more.
Paying money could soon come to the club.
"I'll save one more game as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," he confirmed, despite the fact that Sigma did not win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that there won't be a win.
If we had played like that since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet," thinks Lébr.
Sigma in Opava survived the home side's initial pressure, then levelled the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvodo's charges reached, but they didn't make the point to a goal, so they couldn't win.
The result is not to our liking.
To complete satisfaction, however, we lacked only one converted chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach or the fans," Lébr said.
Pressure must be taken into account by Sigma
The players would not comment much after the Opava game of last week's events.
I'm trying to put these things out of here.
I tried not to admit it," said the young goalkeeper, Michal Reichl, shaking his head.
Completely without comment, the question was then left to the Lebara statement last week by striker Václav Vašíček, who did not convert Sigma's biggest opportunity in Saturday's game.
Eventually, however, he did talk a little about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to pull out on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride on the shithole, we'll do it," he said.
The warning was taken to heart
Nor did coach Leoš Kalvoda shaken up the fact that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and you could see today that Mr. Lébro's warning was taken to heart.
Even before, it wasn't about not wanting to fight and floundering," the Olomouc coach said.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took a while to get down to the toughness and realize what the second league is about.
That it's not just about football, it's about the fight," Kalvoda said.
One can only hope that in the next matches it will be working from the start.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
