In a 911 call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
During a call to 911 with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he had shot his girlfriend and needed them to come to their home.
Lamb surmised that his &quot;sweet dog&quot; was alive and probably upset at home, and that contacts for the dead woman&#39;s family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss&#39; body and a handwritten note on white office paper: &quot;I&#39;m so sorry and I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she&#39;s the only one who ever loved me,&quot; read the letter, which according to of authorities signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school&#39;s campus, where police believe he shot and killed popular professor Ethan Schmidt in his office doorway.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard gunshots at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made the fateful 911 call shortly afterwards.
Finally came yet another death; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
A day after a school shooting forced students and faculty behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to figure out Lamb&#39;s motivation.
Details released by state investigators and students and staff who knew him combined to paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students confirmed that they looked forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed he had no criminal record or violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote to thank the &quot;great people&quot; with whom he shared academic life.
The two taught in the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses with both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it comes to problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, &quot;like something was wrong with him.&quot;
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb previously requested a medical leave from Delta State University when he said he had some kind of problem.
And he only taught two online courses this year.
Recent university hiring changes meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked hard for would not have guaranteed him automatic tenure to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that &quot;something seemed to be bothering Mr. Lamb.&quot;
Lamb will not answer these questions.
After he drove off campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state line back into Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a handgun in the backyard of a home about a mile from his parents&#39; in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State Coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car running on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb drove to the home, though Johnson said he likely knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and education classes.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb&#39;s longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was this cool older guy who tutored her on guitar for several years.
It was quite the heartbreaker back then.
All the girls&#39; hearts melted when he showed up,&quot; says Hairston, now 40 and living in suburban Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, &quot;I killed my wife,&quot; but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that abuts a branch of the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss&#39; ex-husband, Shawn O&#39;Steen, said they separated 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, now 19.
&quot;She was completely devastated,&quot; O&#39;Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O&#39;Steen said he had not met Lamb, but knew through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Later they played random gigs together.
O&#39;Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss was the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
&quot;They were just a happy couple,&quot; he said.
We flirted and recorded each other as a joke.
I mean they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slain professor, taught a first-year seminar and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys&#39; student club and student government.
At Delta State&#39;s Cleveland campus Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight vigil.
Schmidt&#39;s wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schnidt, also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang &quot;Bright Morning Star&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;
School started again on Wednesday.
&quot;We&#39;re trying to get our students to come back,&quot; LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now say that Lamb made the 911 call after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no proof that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won&#39;t be hiring as many seasonal workers as last year, but the toy and product maker says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will begin recruiting applicants this month, and will hire from October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help in stores and sales, to ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his &#39;date&#39; with Princess Diana
The premiere of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
&quot;We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized the seat next to me was empty and it dawned on me that Princess Diana was going to be sitting there,&quot; he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The movie starts and I realize I&#39;m on the verge of what could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
&quot;Back in Time,&quot; is a documentary about &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, &quot;It really is, to me, inarguably the best travel documentary ever made.&quot;
&quot;Back in Time&quot; will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia&#39;s stepped-up military support for Syria is that &quot;there is no military solution&quot; to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly&#39;s ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions within the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers &quot;made this situation intractable.&quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching the Iran nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to label him as someone who often changes his mind.
The others waved at it as if it were a joke.
And some are preparing to implode.
But as much as some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, they&#39;re not succeeding (so far).
10 of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump leading by double digits, and some people are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul&#39;s nomination chances.
Of course, it&#39;s still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry&#39;s leadership paved the way for Herman Cain&#39;s rise, with neither of them winning a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could stumble in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush&#39;s Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are realizing Trump&#39;s will to endure and are beginning to pour their dollars into the standoff with the goal of bringing him down.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul isn&#39;t just a passing phase:
Trump&#39;s approval rating has turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And those numbers are holding up in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac University poll last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &quot;excited&quot; or &quot;satisfied&quot; with Trump as the nominee.
Only two in 10 said they would be &quot;outraged&quot; by his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be &quot;thrilled&quot; versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next closest in level of excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;upset&quot; if establishment favorite Jeb Bush became the nominee.
Most Republicans don&#39;t see Trump&#39;s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bluster and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide think the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll Monday.
The same number holds in the Iowa caucus, which ranks first in the nation, where 52 percent of Republicans think he has a commanding personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn&#39;t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn&#39;t belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
Asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That&#39;s a change from late July, when four in 10 were betting their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven&#39;t had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
This time in the last cycle, 4 in 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination versus 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Still, it appears that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even with Republicans rallying around another candidate, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump&#39;s lead, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll from early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump would almost always win majority support.
She leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He&#39;s in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one matchup.
The vast majority of Donald Trump&#39;s supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they won&#39;t change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say they&#39;ve never changed their mind.
46 percent say they are keeping the back door open for a switch between candidates.
Still, Trump&#39;s current strongest opponent is fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who see their opinion as final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 in 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot;thugs&quot; in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has remained front and center in the conversation for 2016.
Some worry that Trump&#39;s bluster will lure key Hispanic voters away from the GOP and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
It seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration with government reaches new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive about half the support of Republican voters today, largely because of their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they&#39;re also very angry with Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa poll a few weeks ago found that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and 21 percent &quot;pissed off.&quot;
The House supported a larger state share of coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government&#39;s amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of revenue from fees from surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised the deputies that thanks to this, both the state treasury and municipal budgets would get extra money.
The bill was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget. In the first reading, the Chamber supported the government&#39;s amendment to the Mining Act, which means, among other things, that the state should to receive a larger share of the revenue from surface mining fees from lignite mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The bill also changes the method of calculating the payment for minerals that companies extract.
The change in fees for mineral extraction is expected to bring 427 million crowns more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, it should have a neutral impact on the revenues of municipal budgets, because the fee is supposed to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
About 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from brown coal mining.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payment from mining areas with permitted mining to 1,000 crowns per one hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the deputies that thanks to this, the municipalities will receive instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be set by the government through its regulation.
The payment will be newly calculated as the product of the amount of mined mineral and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned against the fact that setting the fee by government order may not be in accordance with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges a mineral that is state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of the mining of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects from mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to the repair of damage after mining or to ensure the mining rescue service.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who argued that it would damage the municipalities and regions affected by mining.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostové) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
&quot;It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance can improve his budget,&quot; said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned against an increase in unemployment in Mostek.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for finalization.
The reasoned report states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as more than 90 percent of the prices are long-term contracts.
Main consumers such as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel the increase in prices.
&quot;However, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,&quot; the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees is bearable from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that the deputies know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and especially the government&#39;s decision on coal mining limits even before the law is approved.
If coal is mined even beyond the limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he emphasized.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national economic reasons and for the long-term stability of the domestic energy industry.
Veselý will lead the Czech Republic as number one, the deployment will be affected by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board during Thursday&#39;s draw for the Davis Cup tie in India, and this time each of them will most likely make an impact in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the load among the entire quartet due to the difficult conditions.
In Delhi, there is heat and high humidity, so tough matches are expected, which can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I would like to spread it out by weather.
And depending on how it will look, Navrátil said during today&#39;s training of the Czech national team at the Raja Kumar Khanna center.
With the team&#39;s number one and world number 40, Jiří Veselý, he is counting on Friday and Sunday&#39;s singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will probably rotate in the number two position.
I would like almost everyone to participate.
I have it in my head a little bit, but I won&#39;t say it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech lineup should be Štěpánek&#39;s participation in Saturday&#39;s doubles.
The only question is who will stand next to the experienced doubles player, who has an 18-4 record in Davis Cup doubles.
It probably won&#39;t be a happy one.
There are still options with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
&quot;I really don&#39;t know with whom and how it will look,&quot; Navrátil said.
It will be decided according to the development of the singles matches.
A variant can be Pavlásek, with Veselý they surprised in the 1st round by winning the doubles over the Australians.
&quot;He is very decent,&quot; said Navrátil.
I did it against Australia, and when I play I would like to perform the same way I did there from the second set.
&quot;I&#39;m glad for the experience and I&#39;d like to make a point,&quot; said Pavlásek.
The home team will field Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won the challenger in Shanghai last week, where he defeated players ranked third and fourth in the hundred.
Number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
They are both players from challengers and our players have experience from the ATP Tour, but we have already convinced ourselves many times that the Davis Cup rankings are not decisive.
&quot;The current form, the weather is decisive,&quot; said Navrátil.
Friday&#39;s opening singles matches start at 6:30 CEST and may be extended due to weather.
According to the forecast, it is supposed to rain and the court is not under a roof.
However, it can be played under artificial lighting.
They&#39;ve already fired it up and it&#39;s got about two thousand lux, which is plenty.
&quot;It should be able to be played under the lights,&quot; said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister&#39;s Questions
Mr Corbyn&#39;s debut at PMQs has been eagerly awaited since his election
New Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut on Prime Minister&#39;s Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, while his performance is likely to be closely scrutinized by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he asked for &quot;less theater and more facts.&quot;
He also stated that he might skip a few sessions, which he would leave to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby&#39;s leadership, coming after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC&#39;s annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labor leader&#39;s decision to stand in silence during the national anthem at a service to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has drawn criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several newspaper front-page stories.
Mr Corbyn&#39;s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would &quot;stand in respectful silence&quot; and acknowledge &quot;the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.&quot;
However, a member of Mr Corbyn&#39;s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two&#39;s Newsnight program that he would advise the Labor leader to sing the national anthem &quot;regardless&quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn&#39;s top team, citing differences on the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and just under a sixth of the parliamentary party initially backed him as leader.
The BBC&#39;s political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences at Labor are also &quot;accumulating&quot; following Mr Corbyn&#39;s appointment over his position in the European Union and the government&#39;s benefit cap.
Mr Corbyl told the TUC conference that the Labor Party was putting forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a benefit cap.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party had &quot;very clearly&quot; opposed the government&#39;s plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labor leader to face David Cameron in the decade since he was elected Conservative leader.
The Labor leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has &quot;crowdsourced&quot; ideas for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP says PMQs are too confrontational and will refrain from both &quot;quick answers&quot; and back-and-forth trade, promising instead to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn says Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will stand in for him at PMQs when he is not attending — such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of having other peers step in for him from time to time, saying he had yet to discuss the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; style of politics often associated with PMQs, but admitted years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of the judgment of leaders, their conduct of the House and their standing among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.

The pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped following the data, showing a recovery in UK wages growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by SABMiller&#39;s bid target.
Between May and June, GB&#39;s profits, including bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like estimates of when rates will rise are coming together.
Sterling was up more than 1% against the dollar at $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the standout stock in the market, jumping 20% after receiving an approaching bid from rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont&#39;s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it raised $2.5bn using a shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the company to &quot;sell.&quot;
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports firm reported an 83% jump in half-year pre-tax profits to £46.6m
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports&#39; executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot;more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers.&quot;
But purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh higher labor costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports&#39; expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building marshmallow are cheering.
The controversial building got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision illegal and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested in front of the Prague 1 office, and a petition was created, against the construction that is to be built in close proximity to St. Agnes Monastery in the center of Prague.
In the decision, the magistrate stated that there had been a violation of the Building Act, as all the requisites of the zoning decision had not been complied with.
&quot;The zoning decision in question does not contain certain requirements, for example the type of land, distances from neighboring buildings, the shape of the building described clearly and comprehensibly, the delimitation of the area affected by the construction,&quot; his decision reads.
The municipality also considers it illegal that some documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the construction is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
From the file material, it appears that the land owner only documented his consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not his consent to the location of the building on his land, writes the Department of Building Regulations.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetto from the investment firm, the Department of Building Regulations did not take into account the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for starting the review had already passed.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
&quot;We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned,&quot; said Razetto in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallow due to the allegedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city center in the past to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are upset that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of St. Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project was changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which included a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monuments Institute (NÚ), and in 2010, the permission of the Prague preservationists was cancelled.
However, the new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NPÚ and municipal preservationists, and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the objections of the opponents, saying that he never expected a facade in pink color, which gave the project its nickname after the pink and white candy.
A Czech politician gave a ride to migrants.
The Hungarians put him to death with them too.
Berg went to Hungary with the aim of bringing humanitarian aid to the refugees.
Along the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who they said they wanted to talk about half a kilometer.
At that time, according to him, it was not yet a crime in Hungary, he claimed to Lidov noviny.
We knew that the law enforcement officers did not deal with such behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and took us to the pre-trial detention center in Szeged, the paper described.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
It is said that the policemen behaved correctly, but communication was difficult because they did not speak English very well.
However, according to him, the prison was dismal.
For example, 15 refugees from Syria were crammed into our cell measuring about three by four meters.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there for the second day, and because of the language barrier, none of them had any idea what would happen to them, Berg said.
What can he no longer confiscate?
Ask the President of the Executor&#39;s Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. will answer readers&#39; questions from 9:30 a.m. President of the Executor&#39;s Chamber of the Czech Republic Mgr. Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her about the changes to the Act on Executions valid from September 1, 2015, as well as other matters related to executions or executors.
Metcash is launching a rural campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi&#39;s onslaught in South and Western Australia.
Metcash is launching a rural campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are joining in with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo&#39;s offering tastings in IGA stores and store owners selling discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defensive strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware retailer holds its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash IGA business moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture 5 percent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, which have taken sales from all existing players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the IGA retailer could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in Western Australia over the next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in the respective markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in Metcash&#39;s fixed price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax earnings, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Metcash&#39;s grocery sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will shrink from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent until 2020.
Last week senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, said business lunches in Melbourne could &quot;quite possibly disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Douglass&#39; comment.
But a Metcash board member is understood to have contacted Douglass last week.
IGA&#39;s market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from food store Metcash, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting a change in operating performance on speculation as sales and revenues come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has counter-attacked and is investing more than $150 million a year to match counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers restock stores by adding fast-growing food and private label innovations.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says price-matching and store-refitting programs are catching on and hopes wholesale will return to underlying profitable profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit for his behavior rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the casualty of the recent row over friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo often dubbed the &quot;Special Ks,&quot; drew unwelcome attention for his infamous affair with Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison afterwards stating: &quot;Wawrinka should have handed one to Kyrgios and I should have handed one to him.&quot;
While he was last seen smashing his racquet after a cramp derailed his potential takedown of Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Kokkinakis has been steadfast in his defense of Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for the second singles spot behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking pretty hard about the fact that I think Thanasi has been a bit of a drag on the whole controversy,&quot; Healy says.
He destroyed his racquet when he lost to a cramp in the US, but he&#39;s not the first player to take out his anger on his racquet out of frustration. I know Thanasi quite well and I can tell that he will not be proud of this event.
But seriously, he handled himself very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He&#39;s got a fantastic team around him, he&#39;s got a great family around him as well and I think he&#39;s been treated a bit harshly.
He&#39;s a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits in great with the team and so on, he&#39;s never had a problem with the other players, he&#39;s very well respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he&#39;s in amazing shape, he&#39;s a very stable and mature young lad and I in short, I think it deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important match starting on Friday, saying a &quot;mutual decision&quot; was the right thing to do for everyone, but backed the Canberra native to return to the squad as a long-term regular.
&quot;First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the match and not on all the controversy surrounding him [Kyrgios],&quot; says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer and Murray and other people point out, he&#39;s rising quickly in the public eye, he&#39;s also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he&#39;s getting, but we&#39;re trying to support him, we&#39;re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight where he can think about it is the best solution for the team as well as himself in my opinion.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
After declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to cross it illegally in a bid to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants piled up in no man&#39;s land and Serbian authorities reacted with outrage.
Those who are stuck for an unknown period of time on the strips of land between two states are those who are fleeing violence in their native countries, setting up tents and settling down.
But feelings of frustration come.
As a helicopter flies overhead, the migrants chant together &quot;Open the borders!&quot; and cursing the orderly unit of the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
Serbia&#39;s foreign minister says it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; for refugees to be sent back from Hungary while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just an indirect detriment.
During the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries,&quot; says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece and spoke with hopes of an eventual deal next month or at the end of the year that would see EU nations take in more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday convened a special EU European summit next week to discuss the continent&#39;s refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not pin its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday&#39;s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross into their country now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D&#39;Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped put up the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of them are economic migrants seeking a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly at odds with other EU states including Germany.
New laws that came into effect at midnight in Hungary now criminalize breaching the 4-metre fence the government has built on its southern border with Serbia, as well as providing longer prison terms for those smuggling refugees.
&quot;Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,&quot; government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the military deployment, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs on the border for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban&#39;s domestic defense adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border and caught 15 already inside the country.
They broke in by damaging a fence and are now in police custody charged with offenses under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered in barbed wire.
There was chaos at the main border crossing near Roszka, because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and there was a stampede of people.
About 20 got in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Bernie Sanders has been cut in half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place at 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is getting support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the primary contests, top Democratic voters say it&#39;s too early to say they&#39;ve made up their minds about which candidate they&#39;ll support.
But Clinton backers are more confident about their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month&#39;s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographics, while Sanders has gained some.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and is easing, but her lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, with Sanders trailing her by only 5 points.
Clinton&#39;s advantage with Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and she is now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among liberals, but now Sanders trails her by just 5 points in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters statewide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party&#39;s nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her simply because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton&#39;s current supporters are particularly fired up about her.
Views are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked an open-ended question why they want her as the nominee, the most common responses are that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it&#39;s time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this work (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, the great possibility of election and agreement on problems is cited.
As the vice president considers a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to go for it - and a third think he shouldn&#39;t run.
When Democratic primary voters were asked who they would select as their second choice for the party&#39;s nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead will expand from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points without him running.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the general election; however, that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when it came to the question of the candidate&#39;s greater importance, Democratic voters prioritized solving problems over a better chance of getting elected.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, score well on some key characteristics among their party&#39;s primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Of the three, Biden leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don&#39;t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don&#39;t think so.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as aligning with their ideological outlook.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton&#39;s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn&#39;t affected their overall view of her at all.
But among the American public, it&#39;s a different story overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the subject was already divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
This is especially true of Republicans, where more than 6 in 10 say their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party&#39;s constituents, the issue remains a concern among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and down 15 from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think she is honest and trustworthy.
And at the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
However, both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush performed best in honesty.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, many voters have not made up their minds about him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national polls
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates account for half of the electorate in the latest poll, leaving the others scrambling for support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot up from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found Carson doing well across demographics, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorino and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has dropped from 10% support to his current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all tied for third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the most recent poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improving to 19% among Republicans behind Trump&#39;s 32%.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
With Carson trending upward, Trump decided to take a blind shot at the retired neurosurgeon, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump&#39;s faith.
&quot;We need energy,&quot; Trump said last Saturday while campaigning in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Five people have been charged with murder nearly two years after a student died during a hazing fraternity ritual in Pennsylvania&#39;s Pocono Mountains.
Members of New York&#39;s Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun &quot;Michael&quot; Deng during a commencement ceremony in September 2013 and were late taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing a total of 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to walk across the frozen field to his destination.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 immediately after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
However, they took the time to change Deng&#39;s clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity&#39;s national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
&quot;At this point, the members began to hide the gear and basically put the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng&#39;s life,&quot; Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly struck in the head, torso and thighs with a blunt object.
&quot;Too many families have been devastated by fraternity hazing, and at least one student has died each year from hazing since 1970,&quot; Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng&#39;s family, wrote in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this step is important from the authorities.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.
&quot;We want to arrest not only the individuals involved, but in the event that there is an organization that sanctioned this, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well,&quot; Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity terminated its relationship with local chapters.
This is what happens when the Fed raises interest rates
The rate hike will come and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don&#39;t know is how much time it will take and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant of how the economy and financial assets will respond.
That&#39;s why Fed officials have emphasized so strongly that investors shouldn&#39;t be focused on when rate hikes will begin, but rather the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There really are more variables at play.
However, at the end of the day, market members may be convinced that all the hype about speed increases may be overblown.
&quot;The Fed&#39;s first hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of &#39;cheap money,&#39;&quot; Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more mainstream but still low levels to create the seismic shock that many may fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here&#39;s a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month or so, the expected rate hike may make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be as dramatic.
&quot;There appears to be a trend for stocks to stall again 12-24 months after the first hike, again possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market has often gone the most - about 14 percent - into rate hikes in relatively flat 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal again after 500 days, with an average with a six-cycle return of 14.4 percent, according to a recent Barron&#39;s analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and the return begins to diminish.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help it along.
The Fed is currently facing some unprecedented conditions that could precipitate a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product near its lowest point in history as the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice was nominal year-on-year GDP growth below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be sustained when it was just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against this difficult economic backdrop could be risky, and the question could be &quot;whether this time is different,&quot; Deutsche said.
Market participants have been braced for Fed hikes all year, with all eyes on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week and ending on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent chance.
&quot;In our study since 1950, all the leverage cycles to date have been in a super-cycle of leveraging, with GDP masking the early recession peaks very quickly after the incipient recovery,&quot; the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst of the recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months and counting.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates rate hikes and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is seen more quickly in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction immediately after the first arrival of a bull/bear cycle.
At the end of a bullish cycle, bond yields fall immediately,&quot; Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe the rate hike will cause yields between long- and short-dated bonds to converge, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often do better in this climate, although &quot;we&#39;re still cautious about the yield squeeze,&quot; Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
&quot;Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are few signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,&quot; she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased -- all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, firms that do most of their business in the US stand to gain when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will fare worse because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt will also increase.
&quot;History shows that the &#39;quality&#39; of stocks tends to outperform within three months of an initial rate hike,&quot; Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a note to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet firms by an average of 5 percentage points in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004.
Companies with high returns on equity, as well as low-volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock plays, consumers are also benefiting from a rising dollar.
Savers may also see their gains through higher yields, but experts have different opinions on how long that will last.
BBC Radio 3 is a copycat of Classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham slammed the station for &quot;dumbing down&quot;
He takes the view that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they are simply cheating the British people
Fellow MP Damien Collins attacked Hlas and says he is not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is &quot;changing&quot; into Classic FM, a leading MP claims, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove they do something commercial broadcasters don&#39;t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service broadcaster appeared to be &quot;dumbed down&quot; and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
&quot;Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word &#39;dumbed down&#39; - but they seem to be changing to Classic FM,&quot; he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you&#39;re trying to do something different - those are two examples that I can think of where you&#39;re basically just mimicking what we already have in the market,&quot; Mr Bingham said.
The BBC director-general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn&#39;t have learned on any other radio station.
And their commitment to living music and making music is truly second to none.
&quot;I also think Radio 3&#39;s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is also very important,&quot; he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before because Britons were less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production to come under fire for going after commercial competitors during its Culture, Media and Sport broadcasts, and they received a commission hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has hit out at The Voice - the music talent show which the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22m.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced &quot;in a typical BBC way.&quot;
He added that he wants the Corporation to &quot;find a hit from its own stable&quot; when it next launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending license fee payers&#39; money on other entertainment formats.
Online sales are growing at their slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000
Online sales were boosted three years ago by mobile shopping
Experts believe November&#39;s Black Friday could be the reason for the slowdown in spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, turning many of Britain&#39;s high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are signs online sales are leveling off, with new figures showing a seven per cent rise in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the slowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with an increase of just 5 percent over last year.
Experts say there are signs online sales are leveling off, with new figures showing a seven per cent rise in the first three months of 2015.
&quot;If you look at the level of growth over the years and go back to the 2000s, it has always rationalized over time,&quot; Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (the growth) is somewhat stagnant and therefore seems to be fading away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was adopted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers may hold off on purchases ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than average shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases, dropping multiple retailer websites in the process.
Experts believe Black Friday, which makes shoppers bargain again, could be holding back shoppers from making further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 in every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the crane fall in Mecca and the Bin Laden family was sanctioned
The bodies of the 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane collapse at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed somewhat in white, mourners made their way and paid their respects to the victims as the first of the fallen made their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad message passed around the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family&#39;s construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of the 29 dead after a crane collapsed at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before starting the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will take place, and thousands continue to descend on the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but said that the company&#39;s bosses were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused a crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims converge before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not issued a statement on the crane collapse and its representatives were not immediately available for comment.
The royal decrees also faulted the group for not using the latest safety measures, and a lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort spearheaded by the Binladin Group.
Binladin&#39;s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and they run major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son who was disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The crash came amid strong winds and rain just days before millions of people in the kingdom arrive on the pilgrimage that every practicing Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime.
Officials say 158 people still remain in hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be given to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of this amount.
The boss of B&amp;Q claims that Eastern European traders working on the cheap is no longer a trend
The British are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is beyond the point of growth
The result is the opening of 200 Screwfix stores aimed at tradesmen
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&amp;Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting away their hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed skilled Eastern European craftsmen to work in their homes
If you can handle a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the company boss behind Screwfix B&amp;Q.
Veronique Laury, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the homewares chain, says the large increase in skilled traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at traders and close 60 B&amp;Q outlets.
Ms Laury says she wants to employ more women in B&amp;Q stores because eight out of ten in-store shopping decisions are made by better halves.
Currently, the majority of workers are male.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that show more female households doing more home improvement than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says: &quot;Most of the people working in our shops are still men.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of the decisions regarding product purchases.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of UK FTSE100 companies, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among its staff, including its chief executive and chief financial officer.
Ms Laury claims: &quot;It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important theme here.
So it was not difficult to find good women to take with us.
Kingfisher reported a fall in both mid-year profit and sales after the group took on the costs of store closures.
Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&amp;Q, is set to open 200 new stores as a result of the trend
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is at risk.
&quot;It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice,&quot; said TOP 09 vice-chairman Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
The chairman of the ODS deputies, Zbyněk Stanjura, noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long term it would be better if it were in a standard valuation, because it would be reflected in the following years.
&quot;We have room to find a mechanism to arrange this,&quot; Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be valorized beyond the scope of the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy with the argument that it will improve the social situation of pensioners, which according to her is not rosy.
According to her, a higher valuation next year would mean a budgetary impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and the ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the rate of valorization had decreased.
Reporter Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) drew attention to the fact that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right-wing veto will significantly complicate and possibly make the payment in December impossible, he said.
Therefore, the chairman of the ČSSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, proposed shortening the period for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, even that was blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month to do it instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the state a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money should come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions should increase by about one hundred crowns on average.
According to the pension amendment, people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December should receive the allowance.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their right to a pension in December before it was paid out.
However, they would have to apply for the supplement in writing, by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valued regularly in January, by the increase in prices and a third of the increase in real wages.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of the gross salary, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the final state account, the state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, which was roughly five billion more year-on-year.
Expenditures on old-age pensions represented 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all legally mandated expenditures.
According to the data in the state final account, the average full old-age pension increased by 104 to 10,714 crowns last year.
The Czech Social Security Administration ensured the payment of 2.4 million full retirement pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career and will devote himself to science.
According to the Russian media, the billionaire had a Senate seat almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was supposed to represent the western Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolay Tsukanov, as a candidate of the United Russia ruling party, successfully defended his post in Sunday&#39;s elections.
According to Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names he announces before the gubernatorial election.
After the election, he will choose the senator himself from the three candidates.
A complication for Yakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin did find an exception for Yakunin, with the fact that he is an extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador, to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
Filming of the Czech comedy Teorie tigra has ended.
The final straw in the protagonist&#39;s resolve is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on grandfather&#39;s life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar path.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control over his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the past, Slavík said in the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in a comedic form, in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
It was said that it was clear from the beginning that the main role would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Nevividení.
Nevertheless, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break connected with recovery from a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed together three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad it was.
And he surprised me that he is apparently a cocooned athlete.
Before, he always asked where he would sit before filming the next scene.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks and even walked up a hill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women marry a tiger in order to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They pour him some food, but immediately close the gate so that he doesn&#39;t think of playing tiger outside the rabbit hutch.
And that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to tell our film about, commented the actor.
His wife, who can have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She is not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and well meaning.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to nurse her husband to death, Bajgar pointed out.
In parallel, the film also depicts the fates of Jan&#39;s married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and Erik and Pepík&#39;s sons-in-law - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The producer of the film is Petr Erben from the company Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Internet company Google has promised to provide an additional 5.5 million dollars (CZK 132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees streaming into Europe.
Google.org, the Internet company&#39;s charitable arm, made the announcement on Tuesday.
Azerbaijan canceled part of Telička&#39;s visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech member of the European Parliament for the ANO movement Pavel Telička postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this by the EP resolution from last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telička co-authored.
With the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telička lost the possibility of talks with official partners as well as the visit of political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of the parliament and representatives of the executive, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, specified the text sent to ČTK.
The EP resolution condemns the &quot;unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan&quot;.
She called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent sentencing of Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismail, who advocated for exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building its air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out that a Russian airbase would be established in Syria in the future.
We have no such plans yet.
But nothing is ruled out, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which until now has been used more as a service and logistics center.
However, according to reports in the Russian press, deliveries of Russian weapons and military equipment to Syria have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says that the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains the stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia&#39;s specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov about the situation in Syria on Tuesday, it was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow next week to express concern over Russia&#39;s buildup of arsenals near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow&#39;s support for Assad a losing bet.
He stated that the goals of Russia&#39;s policy in Syria are rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
According to Earnest, this may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what it is, it is not entirely clear.
According to today&#39;s speculations in the Russian press, the war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin&#39;s speech at the upcoming meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York.
On the other hand, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas.
According to today&#39;s report from The New York Times, the US government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
Opinions among White House advisers are said to be diverging.
Citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the TASS agency wrote today that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his stay in New York.
Use sesame oil during a gallbladder diet, hemp oil helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When cold pressed from the seeds, all the healthy substances remain in the oil.
That is why these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common cause of death in Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in cooking food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstones.
These are the cause of 90% of gallbladder inflammations, and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gall bladder problems concern mainly overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can also be used with success in the liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder diet.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should be wary of products from exotic food stores.
Producers from Asia often use roasted seeds for pressing, which have a stronger flavor.
However, the oil will lose all its active ingredients, explained Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovsk, which produces organic cold-pressed virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
Our press can press 8 kilos of sesame in an hour.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, which is why the product meets the criteria for being labeled extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil is beneficial for diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Jarmila Hamerská&#39;s research, which she conducted at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it already starts to burn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, to season salads, and it is particularly suitable in a diet, in which it helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels the most.
If you have heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of total fat and calories you take in.
For example, one tablespoon of sunflower oil contains 62 calories, one tablespoon of rapeseed oil contains 99 calories.
Regarding the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts for 9 months, just like the sesame and hemp ones.
Storing in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life even more.
People recognize old oil mainly by its bitter taste.
On the other hand, cloudiness at the bottom is not a defect.
This is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp belong to the so-called superfoods, which is why hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained from food.
The intake of omega 3 fatty acids is particularly important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition proved that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not need to be afraid of using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best sellers in the Bohemia Olej company.
500 liters are sold annually.
People often take one tablespoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil does not have a distinctive taste, but it strengthens the immune system very well, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kraslice company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, Americans are the most passionate nation of barbecuers.
There are 1.4 grills per household.
Various grilling competitions are held all over the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not far behind.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have never grilled in their life.
The vast majority also grill several times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to marinate the meat a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time retains the health-promoting substances during grilling?
In general, the grilling process itself should be sparing with fat.
Experts agree that most oils begin to lose their flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also contain substances beneficial to the body, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from foods processed at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils cannot be used in grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When you think of meat, the experts from the company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovsk immediately think of grape oil.
It wonderfully complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it has the unique property of enhancing the natural flavor of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, it is one of the few oils that retains health-promoting substances, Daniel Vlček from the Bohemia Olej company, which is one of the few Czech producers of this grape oil, describes the benefits of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape seed oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for preparing cold dishes, for example when seasoning salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
When grilling, it can be used in two ways, during marinating and grilling itself.
We preserve their juiciness by marinating meat and fish.
When preparing a marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
We add acidity with, for example, apple cider vinegar and thus achieve a softening of the meat.
Spices, in turn, add flavor to the meat, and the oil preserves it and gives it the right flavor, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate dark meat.
So the marinated meat or fish is ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare food.
The same applies to grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to linseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, coat the grate with oil to prevent the food from burning.
The preparation of side dishes is also an essential part of grilling.
Almost anything goes well with grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
The chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, the Hot Summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 piece of peach • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup of sliced cucumber • 1 cup of mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil
In a salad bowl, add the torn arugula, sliced cucumbers and a large diced peach to the mixture of salad leaves.
Salt and pepper to taste, you can also season with ground chili and soy sauce.
Finish with a few drops of grapeseed oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it&#39;s not only the drugs that matter, but also the patient&#39;s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients also includes social and legal advice, recommendations for housing modifications, etc.
Nevertheless, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick makes room for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is proven that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient needs a compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and those around them do not succumb to various myths, for example that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is also why the website Dej si schanci (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Dej si schanci.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is the neurologist.
With multiple sclerosis, the adage that the earlier the disease is treated, the more likely the doctor can influence something, is true twice.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process is not yet as strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay invalidation, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with multiple sclerosis, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
We work with patients according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
&quot;It&#39;s really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient,&quot; says MUDr. Martina Kövári, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Education Medicine at the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
Physical activity, however, also strengthens the body&#39;s immune status, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
&quot;During exercise, endorphins also flow out and you feel good after it,&quot; points out PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of the University Hospital of Královská Vinohrady.
By affecting the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
In this way, we directly intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
&quot;Previously, these patients so-called sparing themselves, today we know that they need targeted exercise,&quot; says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Education Medicine, University Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is to enable a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including employment.
Physiotherapists therefore work together with occupational therapists so that each person receives a compensatory aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it shakes most people.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They have to react to a heavy load - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we should go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
&quot;I work with them so that they finally come to the conclusion that even with a handicap you can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life,&quot; says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Airbuses would not fly without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere.
Aerospace manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
New planes are full of titanium or light and strong composite materials that no one can produce and process right away.
Nevertheless, next to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclaves for shaping composites, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot pits.
In the drum, which resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are tumbled in a pile of bricks.
&quot;So far, no one has come up with anything better,&quot; smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
The former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320 at the site in Prague&#39;s Letňany.
They are the only ones in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Passengers also enter first and higher class on the upper decks of the world&#39;s largest airliner, the Airbus A380, through the doors, part of which is being assembled in Prague.
Composite doors for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner are also assembled here.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company has torque wrenches adjusted twice a year.
If there was no inspection record on the yellow sticker, they would have something to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing at the Prague plant, who come regularly to find out if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
However, advanced technology has not yet completely replaced human senses.
There are 1500 rivets on one A320 door.
Users have to knock them out manually.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the falling hammer, they can tell if the rivet has already been properly tapped.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet can protrude from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the surface of the aircraft.
That&#39;s roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
A trained touch comes into play during inspection.
When the inspector runs his finger over a row of rivets, he can tell if any are out of tolerance.
Only then will he pick up an accurate deviation meter.
Before 1989, Letov supported the L-39 military training aircraft program.
But in 1991 not a single one was produced.
The company had to quickly find new orders.
It was then that it teamed up with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
It won the tender for the supplier of emergency doors for the A321 model.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
&quot;At that time, we were a small company that did not have enough money for investments and to be able to guarantee long-term stable deliveries to Boeing,&quot; recalls Dubský.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained closed if Letov had not attracted the French Latecoere group at the Prague conference of the international association of the aviation industry in 1999.
I spoke there about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French started, says Dubský.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with a strong company.
As early as 2000, assembly of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, upper deck doors were added for the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for the processing of composites for deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not have been able to get these large orders on our own.
Maybe we would make parts or small components.
The partners want supply guarantees for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
An exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any aircraft doors.
According to Dubský, it costs millions of crowns to obtain certificates that production processes meet customer requirements and to maintain them during repeated inspections.
Production processes change every year.
They are more precise and strict.
We have to retrain employees, retrofit equipment and re-certify the entire process, adds Dubský.
Now the company is completing the preparation of the process for plating with zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing cadmium, which is harmful to human health.
Although they received the assignment from the manufacturer, they then had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come and check the concept of the entire line.
Then we will show them the production.
They will also check our laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, Dubský explains the way in which customers check them.
The Prague company is rewarded with long-term exclusive contracts.
Today, the production of embraers stands and falls with the Prague plant.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that he can ask any price for the door.
A price curve is part of the contract.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, or hundreds of manufactured pieces.
The price per piece keeps falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this pricing formula.
If not, we will lose money, says Dubský.
Half of the hall, where electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the scenes, a new semi-robotic line for riveting and assembly of doors for the upgraded A320 Neo model is being built here.
Riveting becomes faster and more accurate.
&quot;That&#39;s the trend towards assembly in aviation,&quot; adds Dubský.
Sales of the future line are secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3,278 units of the new A320 model so far.
A line for the complete assembly of doors for the upper deck of the A380 will be established just a few meters away.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests, for example for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment in the doors for the largest Airbus.
The company also bets on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
&quot;It is a huge credit for the company that it can process composites in addition to metal materials,&quot; says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is reaching the edge of its production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the Letov campus, where it is based.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now there are 800 of them, and within three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing compete over how many hundreds of new planes they order every year, airlines need not worry about their jobs.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, the mother company of Prague&#39;s Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, they exchanged part of their loans for shares.
Creditors acquired a 37.4 percent stake in the company by increasing capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company&#39;s debt fell by two thirds, i.e. by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company subscribed new shares to existing shareholders for 222.9 million euros.
In total, it increased the share capital by 280 million euros.
At the same time, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
He expects average order growth of four percent per year until 2017.
It has 2.6 billion euros worth of orders in its order book, which corresponds to four years of production.
French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on drips.
The Czech race in Prague&#39;s Letňany is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group&#39;s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Deputies supported a larger share of the state from coal fees.
The change in fees for mineral extraction is expected to bring 427 million crowns more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, it should have a neutral impact on the revenues of municipal budgets, because the fee is supposed to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and 150 million crowns from the state budget.
About 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from brown coal mining.
The amendment also provides for an increase in payment from mining areas with permitted mining to one thousand crowns per one hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the deputies that thanks to this, the municipalities will receive instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns per year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be set by the government through its regulation.
The payment will be newly calculated as the product of the amount of mined mineral and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned against the fact that setting the fee by government order may not be in accordance with the constitution.
However, according to Minister Mládek, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges a mineral that is state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be given to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of the mining of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects from mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to the repair of damages after mining or to ensure the mining rescue service.
The bill was criticized today by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would harm the municipalities and regions affected by mining.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Starostové) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
&quot;It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance can improve his budget,&quot; said David Kádner (Úsvit), elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned against an increase in unemployment in Mostek.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for finalization.
The reasoned report states that, according to the mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, as more than 90 percent of the prices are long-term contracts.
Main consumers such as power plants or heating plants should therefore not feel the increase in prices.
&quot;However, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,&quot; the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees is bearable from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urbana (ČSSD), it is crucial that the deputies know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and especially the government&#39;s decision on coal mining limits even before the law is approved.
If coal is mined even beyond the limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he emphasized.
Urban disagrees with Mládek that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national economic reasons and for the long-term stability of the domestic energy industry.
Interest rate decision time for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain idle for some time, leaving interest rates in the 0-0.25 percent range.
It is a historic event as it has been over a year since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates,&quot; says Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has done relatively well, with a recovery adding trillions of dollars to the government account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
They have warned markets to be ready for a hike, but circumstances suggest they also see strong odds against the move.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday — and a colleague later that day — wrote a note saying he was &quot;sorry&quot; for the first killing and wished he could take it back, government officials revealed Tuesday authorities.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social studies teacher at Delta State University, called police around 10 a.m. Monday morning.
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send the police to his house.
He said: &quot;I shot my wife last night&quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot;cute dog&quot; in the house who &quot;won&#39;t bother anyone&quot; but is upset.
Police requested the name of the caller, but Lamb did not identify himself.
Lamb also did not explain why shots were fired at the home.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb that read: “I&#39;m so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.&#39;
After leaving the message, Lamb made the 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life.
The university&#39;s dean, William LaForge, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that &quot;there was clearly something going on in Mr. Lamb&#39;s head.&quot;
Despite Monday&#39;s statement that Lamb allegedly believed Amy Prentiss was romantically involved with Schmidt, government officials said there was &quot;no evidence&quot; of a &quot;love triangle.&quot;
Shawn O&#39;Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was &quot;a great person&quot;.
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
O&#39;Steen and Prentiss&#39; 19-year-old daughter was &quot;shaken&quot; by the whole affair.
O&#39;Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were &quot;best friends.&quot;
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
&quot;She always wanted to help others,&quot; Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives Monday and said he was &quot;not going to jail.&quot;
When officers caught up to him on a highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled over and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015, according to a resume he posted on the school&#39;s website.
Stars that have lost their magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All these things certainly take their toll.
Manchester United&#39;s Luke Shaw will be out for several months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg during Manchester United&#39;s Champions League defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
While the left-back has been left in tears by the injury and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and believes Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw made his way into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and also needed an oxygen mask before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: &quot;He suffered a double fracture in his leg and is now in hospital.&quot;
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then further operated on in Manchester.
It&#39;s terrible - a lad who comes to Manchester at 18 has it very difficult, but he&#39;s playing fantastically and then this happens.
He also had an oxygen mask on when he was in the locker room.
He was crying.
I&#39;m not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won&#39;t be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to receive a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty tackle with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw&#39;s account said: &quot;Thank you everyone for their messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my road to recovery begins now and I will come back even stronger.&quot;
Related: Manchester United pick up Luke Shaw injury in defeat against PSV
The England defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: &quot;It was a very nasty injury.&quot;
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad.
It is never the goal of our players to injure opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal&#39;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult for him because his intention was not to injure an opponent, and when you hear about the severity of an injury like that, it&#39;s not good,&quot; Cocu said.
I was unable to perceive this moment.
I only saw the ball going the other way, so it looked like [Moreno] touched him, but I didn&#39;t see the tackle on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: &quot;I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital following Chris Smalling&#39;s intervention.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: once a child loves a book, it doesn&#39;t take long for them to learn it almost by heart.
But you can&#39;t be David Cameron.
Asked by a children&#39;s scheme provider to name a favorite children&#39;s book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, a 1971 Dr Seuss fable.
It was hard to choose, writes Cameron in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, continuing: &quot;Funny, poignant, creative and powerful, I loved reading this one to my kids because there was always an image or message behind it that I hadn&#39;t seen before. &quot;
Well, until, in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book based on an excerpt from the 2012 film, adding additional characters and details to fill out the brief original text.
&quot;In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree,&quot; is the synopsis book that chronicles the love object unknown to Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that wasn&#39;t suspicious enough on its own, the text provided by Cameron reads like a synopsis of The Lorax, found on the Internet Movie Database, and begins: &quot;In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey.&quot;
Being an openly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would be unfamiliar with the book&#39;s plot, where an unnamed young man learns that local wildlife is being ravaged by a rapacious, tree-cutting industrialist, the Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorax, a crouched, mustachioed creature , which &quot;speaks for the trees.&quot;
Most likely, such a relatively insignificant PR task was given to an assistant who had never read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text most likely came from the office of Cameron supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of being omitted from England but still holds on
Taking on Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but after looking at the squad England have picked for this tour, I don&#39;t think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat they suffered in the Test series last time will be very likely.
I also wouldn&#39;t rule out an away win outright.
Alastair Cook&#39;s side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spinners in this batting line-up and the collective mindset is strong too; they won&#39;t carry the scars of 2012, just youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is an emerging spinner and Adil Rashid, though unknown at Test series level, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England squad for experience series, replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave out Adam Lyth is a tough nut to crack for me as his head coach is at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests came against two good attacks in tough conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on performance.
For example, there were no question marks surrounding Joe Root&#39;s name leading up to the announcement because — and I&#39;ve said this before — players are their own best selectors.
A few more half-centuries and Lyth could have extended his streak, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, as he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will arise.
England&#39;s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even though his performances weren&#39;t quite 100 per cent, and that doesn&#39;t surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batsman gets to prove himself is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could grumble about is that England gave Jonathan Trott an early chance in the Caribbean — despite Lyth being in top form — but that wasted opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in and he&#39;s a batsman I rate very positively.
He&#39;s the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he made 236 against us at Trent Bridge which kind of did it.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this will all depend on the overall set-up in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook to get another extra spinner while retaining four quicks has been mooted and I have no reservations about it.
I don&#39;t understand why a strokemaker can&#39;t bat and this left handed man has already shown that he is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was their number 3 and it doesn&#39;t make much of a difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 Tests before his 2001 appearance.
He immediately managed three centuries and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I got a chance to watch him he struck me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his raw stats — averages of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and I see that as a punt, but there aren&#39;t many spinners putting their hands up and the selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside of the squad, England appear to have made some changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
Appointing Mahel Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a Test match consultant can be a masterstroke.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who will bring a wealth of experience by being experienced in all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in on the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born straight into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the locker room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and freshen the atmosphere.
Colly Durham&#39;s teammate Ben Stokes was given a day off, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many will disagree, coaches and selectors do not create the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their job depends on results.
Such decisions should never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron&#39;s ill-conceived renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU runs into more trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy &quot;Is it Yes or No?&quot; Corbyn to the head of the Labor Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe to a show on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some member states are fed up with Britain&#39;s self-centered agenda, divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes they mostly didn&#39;t want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn&#39;t want it even if it eroded social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George&#39;s selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It&#39;s all about me.
My European friend, who wants an inward-looking Britain in Europe - &quot;Don&#39;t leave us alone with France,&quot; says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the point where they don&#39;t care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany&#39;s cautiously even-keeled chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad for her, as it did for too long Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl ( 16).
France&#39;s François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also declining.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It&#39;s difficult to watch them break their legs helping the Selfie Brits, who could be better investing their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - something they themselves don&#39;t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend has claimed.
&quot;The renegotiation solved the problem&quot; and &quot;Britain got nothing of value from the negotiations.&quot;
Europeans know to their own detriment how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU the press oligarch barons are because they weren&#39;t there during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum that backed us to join in 1973 by 2-1.
They may vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, the devious Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels &quot;EU straight bananas&quot; correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-avoiding rogues, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo-non-overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realized that when you&#39;re in a cage with a rabid gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her to keep her from having you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband has been more Blair-like than Blair himself in opposing Cameron&#39;s referendum routine, ever since Blair conceded the principle of a scrapped EU constitution was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him the sack card.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he mustn&#39;t waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock&#39;s Murdoch boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat at the BBC he left on Sunday.
Corbyn&#39;s official stance on Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of the rabid tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory little Englanderism can certainly relate to that.
Hilary &quot;Bemm but not Benniite&quot; Benn said as much on radio and TV this week when his inner scout couldn&#39;t bring himself to admit that Corbyn&#39;s appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70&#39;s when his old father fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
The Hillary match was much more attractive.
But fighting to remain &quot;at all costs&quot; - Benn&#39;s phrase - does not appear to have been what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me - the discipline of the message remains important in the age of round-the-clock television and especially in the maelstrom, hotbed of paranoia and betrayal that is social media
It is fair not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe that would allow him to take Labor&#39;s support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell&#39;s and Corbyn&#39;s fundamental wrangling over EU membership - in keeping with their Bennite-besieged-economics, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is central to dogmatic bickering.
As with his contortions about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced the JC campaign won&#39;t want to end it - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions from Britain when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with Britain&#39;s poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday&#39;s launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency&#39;s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published the &quot;landmark&quot; report last month, describing it as a &quot;comprehensive review of the evidence.&quot;
However, several researchers questioned the comprehensiveness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet last month attacked the &quot;extremely flimsy basis&quot; on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts, writing for the BMJ, disputed the claims, which were allegedly &quot;built on rock or sand.&quot;
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: &quot;A fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.&quot;
They state that the public can expect that PHE&#39;s claim that &quot;the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking&quot; is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on the harms associated with different products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also endorsed BAT&#39;s public health credentials in the sustainability report, it says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted to funding from an e-cigarette maker, but not funding he allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for the selection of the panel members is not available, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industry funding in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their anti-smoking expertise.
Tobacco management also attended the meeting at PHE.
The group&#39;s report &quot;eloquently admits&quot; the lack of &quot;hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria,&quot; McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE&#39;s claim that &quot;there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a pathway to smoking for children or non-smokers&quot; was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claim in the BMJ had been answered previously.
He said: &quot;E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.&quot;
One in two lifetime smokers will die because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not without risk, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.
The BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop airing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed his commercial rivals would &quot;give their hands&quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs not made up of other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs, which are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into difficult timeslots compared to its rivals &quot;biggest ratings shows, and on channels like BBC4.
After chief executive Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had unsuccessfully tried to link up with the BBC for the entire six years he worked at Channel 4.
&quot;I struggle with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without the state&#39;s input,&quot; Johnson told the House of Commons communications committee as part of a debate on the future of the BBC.
If you keep the royalties, which I&#39;m not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce production, at least in terms of programs that others don&#39;t make or commission.
They are airing The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support going forward.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably nonsensical.
Johnson said, &quot;I don&#39;t see why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and naturally produced at home.
Honestly, other channels would easily give their right hand for them.
I can&#39;t understand how these are a public service broadcaster.
I don&#39;t think it will weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt guilty about chasing ratings &quot;because of the ambition of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to ensure long-term support.&quot;
His comment about the BBC&#39;s most popular shows echoes that of former Sky chief executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest the BBC would sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said even the more pampered BBC public service programs &quot;are moving to BBC4, where quite often you can&#39;t measure the audience, but they fulfill their mandate and can argue as they go about their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn of license fee income, &quot;But of course we do all these obscure programs that no one watches.&quot;
They broadcast them at a time when no one is watching.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the commission, &quot;I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value out of it.
Of course we all think £150 a year is a lot, but for people who think £150 is a lot, I&#39;d be surprised if they&#39;re paying that much because they don&#39;t watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;.
He confirmed that a small amount of the BBC&#39;s output was now previously classified as educational - it used to be 1% of TV output and 0.1% in radio - and should take a cue from public service broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to &quot;inform, enlighten and amuse.&quot;
On the subject of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which only a handful were televised, and link up with commercial reporters so we could all see them online.
&quot;Sonogenetics&quot; or controlling brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses affect the direction in which nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when hit by sound pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching genetically modified motor neuron cells that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.

The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activate them outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrodes are inserted into the patient&#39;s brain to stimulate the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease.
Nematodes don&#39;t normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that a response occurred when he placed them in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves, which then travel through the worms&#39; bodies.
Amplified ultrasound waves act on TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
The sound waves cause these channels to open and activate the cells they are connected to, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
To control the nematodes with ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
But Chalasani let it be known that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent through an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
&quot;We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,&quot; Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements bashing the British arms trade.
Watch the anti-gun market video from Amnesty International.
Menacing killer drones!
Ankle breaking leg shackles!
Fragmentation bullets!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no marks!
The cheery voice and caricature of the metaphors leave no one in doubt that this ad at the world&#39;s biggest arms fair is a scathing parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government&#39;s willingness to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through the defense and security apparatus of International Veselice at the ExCeL Center in London&#39;s Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being run with posters popping up at bus stops and subways calling for a second look.
&quot;Important announcement, Traveling on DLR from 15th to 18th September?&quot; reads one, using the font from London Underground&#39;s DLR line signs to become an image of a tank.
A swarm of gun dealers will descend on the DLR this September ... Customers are being asked to help stop the gun trade.
The 300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy&#39;s Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group has helped distribute them across London using &quot;Ad Space Hack Packs&quot;, a £6 Allen key which is said to &quot;access around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet&quot;.
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting &quot;vandalism.&quot;
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and seeking to show political activity to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists are transitioning to working with activists within protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets subway passengers.
Amnesty&#39;s video was viewed by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP agency working on a royalty-free basis, with a graphic designer and commentator also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads - he saw a blank spot on the ExCeL calendar - and thought: &quot;Let&#39;s show them the campaign they&#39;re trying to avoid.&quot;
They toyed with creating a more realistic risque corporate ad, but &quot;by adding pops of color and animation, I was able to get more people&#39;s attention.&quot;
&quot;They did a fantastic job helping us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair,&quot; says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the gun trade comes from inside ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US military for the &quot;shoulder-launched AT4CS RS.&quot;
This includes a &quot;uniquely shaped warhead that provides stunning effects from behind the armor inside the target.&quot;

Eight golden rules for college life
I moved into the dorms 11 years ago as an oblivious nineteen-year-old, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now can I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I&#39;ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into dorms can range from mildly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying.
It&#39;s tempting to ramble on: telling people where you&#39;re from, if you&#39;ve taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn and why you &quot;honestly don&#39;t love or hate Marmite because it&#39;s just yeast extract guys HAHAHA, I&#39;ll be in my room.&quot;
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like and the ones you wouldn&#39;t hang out with if your eyelashes were on fire and they were putting out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People&#39;s rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, movie night venues and communal public spaces, but they are also rooms where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don&#39;t even think about starting college and being in a relationship
Introverts just come to college.
Your room should be a haven, yet many dorms are turning to an extra-room walking culture that&#39;s friendly, sociable, and conducive to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone who needs to recharge.
No culture allows you to say, &quot;I like you and want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you.&quot;
Try to recognize when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One boy in my dorms had a habit of being invited in if the door wasn&#39;t locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you started college at the height of baking mania, knocking on strangers&#39; doors and showing up with a tray of baked cookies seems a little less weird, less &quot;Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions.&quot; &quot;
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you and may end up matching your face to a tasty surprise.
This is of course subject to being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed lumps of flour, sugar and starch will likely disrupt others feigning sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls of residence.
Stealing a whole chicken is of course a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Double check with the dairy owner.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they are raging inside.
If someone steals something from you, it&#39;s annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate who traded her milk for dishwashing liquid to punish the thief.
He&#39;s in jail now.
You should not make noises that disturb people from sleeping or studying.
It&#39;s not just about being a decent human being, but you&#39;re also the proverbial people in glass houses.
The girl down my hall asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass a little because it was 3 in the morning and she had a paper in the morning.
Their response was to turn up the music.
When they finally quieted down at 5 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours and then turned up her own music, locked the door, and left for her three-hour paper.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if your future spouse went to the same college as you?
Conversely, wouldn&#39;t it be terribly awkward if you mistook your roommate for your future wife, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe she took control of your mutual friends too?
Of course, you won&#39;t recommend it to your heart - but if your sexy roommate is 100% not your future spouse, try to at least talk to your weaknesses a little.
There&#39;s only a fine line between fun and bullying in the uplifting moment when you realize someone has left the keys in their unlocked room.
A good prank is funny but easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about keeping them safe by hiding something - never destroy someone&#39;s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put their keys in a water bottle to stick in the freezer - but never tape their stuff to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite her uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva already experienced rough times during her pregnancy with the now seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her and she was alone to prepare and raise the child.
I came to terms with the situation relatively quickly - I was very much looking forward to the child and I was looking for positives in it.
I tried not to worry about the uncertainty and the fact that I would be alone with the child.
And I certainly had hope that we wouldn&#39;t be alone for long, Eva recalls today about her first pregnancy.
Even then, she met the older Vašek on the Internet in a chat, with whom they started talking about favorite films.
Vašek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the maternity ward, but he did not rush into the role of stepfather too much.
&quot;He then withdrew from the program for some time,&quot; Eva described in the documentary series Čtyři v tom 3.
The motive of the third series of the Czech television series is precisely the search for luck on the second try.
She managed the care of Vítek and the financial security of the family thanks to her part-time job and the great help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospect of being responsible for a stranger&#39;s child did not ultimately spoil Vaško&#39;s affection for Eva.
They definitely got together around Vítka&#39;s second birthday and he now understands Vašek as his dad and addresses him as such.
Although Vašek already has two adult daughters, he says he enjoys fatherhood in his sixties and pays more attention to his children.
In addition to Vítek, two-year-old Leontýnka was added to them, and eventually twins.
&quot;Vašek came into our family somehow naturally, maybe because my mother never talked to me much about relationships,&quot; thinks a smiling Eva.
Little space?
At least we&#39;re close.
Twins Ema and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with cholestasis of pregnancy at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant women and manifest themselves mainly in itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death; it usually resolves spontaneously after the birth of the mother.
Luckily for Eva and Vaško, Ema and Ela were born healthy, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
Emička was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vaška&#39;s niece also works, who managed to take her in and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and I had her with me immediately after being transferred from the ICU to the room, Eva describes the difficult period after giving birth.
She spent twenty days in the maternity hospital until the doctors agreed to release the babies, who in the meantime managed to reach the two kilo mark.
But waiting for the children to be born in the maternity hospital did not make Eva happy.
&quot;I was crazy with longing for my husband and children,&quot; recalls the difficult moments in the six-partum ward, a mother of four.
She and her husband considered signing the reverse, among other things, because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
However, this did not happen in the end and the doctors released Eva and the twins to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evenings at 9:45 p.m.
Quite a large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric double stove and cramped conditions.
The house didn&#39;t get bigger, but Vašek made Eva happy by installing a gas stove to make it more convenient to prepare food for six people.
When it&#39;s the worst, we&#39;ll take turns driving the taxi.
Eva is convinced that children especially perceive family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or the unkemptness of the house.
So far, we&#39;ve come together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes step over rolling babies, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side in every situation.
Vaška&#39;s work as a lighting engineer for a film is not a guarantee of regular income.
That is why he sometimes goes out into the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his sixty years, according to his own words, he is physically able to take care of the family&#39;s finances and children, but how long will that be?
&quot;I am aware that due to our age difference, one day I will be the one who will feed this family,&quot; admits Eva flatly when asked about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted by the possibility of owning her own business.
With four children, I&#39;m not exactly hot for an employer.
And when the worst comes to worst, my husband and I can take turns driving a taxi, jokes the nice blonde.
Apple has hit the yo-yo effect.
The displays are to blame for everything.
A more powerful processor, a camera with a higher resolution, a stronger chassis or a display that recognizes the force of touch, these are the advantages of the recently introduced ninth generation iPhones.
The last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple&#39;s trend so far has been that each new iPhone generation is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generations, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
At the same time, the two-gram difference in weight to the disadvantage of the new product was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year&#39;s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the smaller model&#39;s weight has increased by 14 grams, and the larger one by a full 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year&#39;s affair with bending in the pockets greatly tormented Apple.
The chassis of the novelties is thus made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology for the new products, thanks to which the displays recognize the force of touch.
For this, it was necessary to equip the display with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the displays of the new iPhones thus increased more than twice compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone, from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of the larger one, from 19 to 40 grams.
The display is thus the heaviest component used in the iPhone 6s.
The weight of only 143 grams is also achieved with this new product thanks to the degreasing crust, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the heaviest element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is noticeable in the display.
The weight of the 5.5&quot; iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
The extent to which the new display technology will be practical will only become apparent during use.
The first users will be able to try it already on Friday, September 25, when sales of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will begin in selected countries.
Have cereal been the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Italy&#39;s Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of modern human habitation from various times, including wall paintings, remains of tools and so on and so forth.
However, in layer 23A, which according to the tools is dated to around 30 thousand years ago, scientists discovered something that is very reminiscent of the remains of a breakfast buffet.
Traces of oat grains were found at the site, which apparently went through the production process of today&#39;s popular flakes.
With it, the grains today are first soaked, then dried, stripped of their packaging, the so-called fluff, then steamed and pressed flat.
In the Paglicci cave, grains were found that were apparently heated or boiled, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least that is what the traces of use on the two stones in the cave suggest.
So the scientists could not prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that a complete flake-making process took place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could have eaten the flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly warm is of course quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes preceded agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New announcements of stations in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So I once again listened to the announcement of the names of the trolleybus stops: Hnusáčkova, Přízrak, Frázova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolley bus was somewhat noisier, so the male voice announcements were somewhat less intelligible than before when the stops were announced by female voices.
A woman&#39;s voice is higher pitched, so it is more discernible in the deeper noise of traffic than a deeper male voice.
The DPMB does argue that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don&#39;t know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I&#39;ve been living in Brno for quite a few decades, so I know the correct names of all those stops by heart, so I don&#39;t need these reports, but foreigners from elsewhere, who are not familiar with Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, may be confused and may ultimately, where they reached by mistake, then claim that the stop they were supposed to get off at was not reported at all.
Perhaps the selection of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be done again, and this time colored by the usual traffic noise and the rumble of the engine, in which the whine of the loudspeaker in the bus is almost lost.
So that we no longer have to listen to the names of the stations Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or then Ponorná in the creaking slag, which I transferred to in Komárov.
I suppose my senile hearing didn&#39;t suddenly deteriorate that much during the one day the bus stop announcer changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning Comrade Chief.
From the trackman&#39;s notes.
Today, few people know what the so-called comprehensive background checks were during the party&#39;s rule.
I allowed myself to remember it.
The bus was late.
I burst into the dispatcher&#39;s office just as the radio announced that it was seven o&#39;clock.
&quot;You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t bump into Comrade Chief, he arrived a minute before you and he doesn&#39;t seem to be in the mood,&quot; the dispatcher commented as I signed the attendance book.
Thanks, I&#39;ll be careful.
Write to me that I&#39;m going around the precincts to review small mechanization.
That won&#39;t work, today is the background check.
Everyone is pissed off about it, it&#39;s horrible.
What is it really about?
&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; the dispatcher sneered.
Next time you will too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Just then the door to the chief&#39;s office opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, stone-faced, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
&quot;Good morning, Chief,&quot; I greeted respectfully, quickly buttoning the two buttons of my uniform jacket.
&quot;Good morning,&quot; came the reply, and I hurried up to the second floor, not realizing the cold, ominous tone the old man responded with.
&quot;You&#39;re kidding,&quot; engineer Eva, an elderly lady whom I respected very much, greeted me.
It is said that she was even the chief before her comrades deposed her.
There are checks and you will arrive anyway.
I have asked many times what comprehensive background checks are, but no one wants to talk much about it.
They say they happen once every three years, everyone has to go, and it&#39;s quite annoying.
At least for some.
I&#39;ll see though.
I took out the folder with periodic reports from the drawer and then the phone.
&quot;Here Holcman, come to me now,&quot; came the chief&#39;s voice.
What&#39;s annoying?
Now we met and nothing ...&quot; I mumbled, but no one answered me, everyone only with their own thoughts.
&quot;Hello, Comrade Chief, I came on your orders,&quot; I reported, barely entering the chief&#39;s office.
The chief was sitting behind a desk, looking at some kind of book.
&quot;Comrade mechanist,&quot; he said after a while, without raising his head and still carefully examining the jet, &quot;I don&#39;t like your behavior at all.&quot;
He threw the pen down on the table, leaned back in the chair and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I was confused.
What&#39;s happening?
Just yesterday, the deputy praised that I have worked very well in the few months in office and that he is extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he took me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician and you have to act accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I have used this greeting since childhood, that I was brought up that way and that I see nothing wrong with it.
To the chief it was like a red rag to a turkey.
&quot;You are on the socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is honor to work,&quot; the sullen chief replied.
And on top of that, you&#39;re still messing up addressing your superiors.
One time you say &quot;sir&quot; and the second time you say &quot;comrade&quot;.
But I&#39;m not Mr. Chief for you, but Comrade Chief.
Deputies are comrade deputies, chief conductors are comrade chief conductors!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir ... Comrade Chief, but ... but I greeted you with the usual civil greeting.
After all, there is nothing wrong with it ... and honor the work, or the comrade ... you know ... I am not in the party ...
&quot;It&#39;s not your advantage that you&#39;re not in the party,&quot; said the chief coldly, who had calmed down a bit in the meantime.
However, we will talk about that later.
Anyway, remember that you don&#39;t have the chair upstairs prepaid for retirement.
That was not good.
When a chief told someone that something was not his priority, it didn&#39;t sit well with that person.
He stared at me for a moment with a cold, piercing gaze, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his haughty behavior.
He was only a few years older and he was playing god, actually comrade god.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as suited him at the moment.
Everyone hated him.
Come on, he&#39;s the chief.
Actually, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization scolded him like all party members, but also non-party members.
But the chief touched many, especially those over whom he could assert his superiority.
He just brushed me off for utter bullshit.
I thought about shit, and it took a lot of effort not to shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn&#39;t even go back to the dirt to the pickaxe, let alone continue working as a railway official.
How would I support two kids?
And a barrack under construction!
I was in a fit of rage, but I controlled myself.
I won&#39;t make him happy.
&quot;That&#39;s all for now, you can go,&quot; the chief ended the audience and began to carefully examine again the lancet he had previously held in his hand.
At half past twelve they summoned me.
Everyone from the office was already there and to the questions of what and how, they answered yes, that it would be good.
Only Jožin bitingly said, as was his custom, that they couldn&#39;t throw us all out because Comrade Chief would have to do the job alone with his loyalists, and that there was no danger.
He emphasized the word &quot;comrade&quot; at the same time, as if he knew what the old man had written me off for in the morning.
There was a nice meeting in the chief&#39;s office.
Comrade Chief behind his desk and other comrades at the long advisory table who were to decide on my being an official or not.
Personnel officer, chairman of the ROH, recorder from personnel, clerk for special purposes, something like a counterattack in the military, and the deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from a friend.
An ordinary railway worker, he tamped sleepers or threw gravel with pitchforks.
But also a former bachelor.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him back then, he was said to be a nice beast.
Evil tongues claimed that he left school in the seventh grade, that he did not learn anything, that he did not know anything.
And when the criminal was abolished, he ended up on the streets with a pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief gestured for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, a lump in my throat that I couldn&#39;t swallow.
Kádrovák read the opinion from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, married, two children, and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, breathing a little better.
Then a report from the party&#39;s street organization.
He copied the report from the civic committee, perhaps the same person wrote them both.
But then it came!
The parents, longtime members of the party, refused to appear before the vetting committee and subsequently left the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The recruiter noticed this and stopped reading.
The chief motioned for him to continue.
It only got worse after that.
I was a member of the SSM city committee and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and in addition to the national committee, I also had my wedding in a church.
I have failed the party&#39;s trust in the worst way.
That&#39;s why I was removed from her list of candidates.
But that wasn&#39;t enough!
I had both children baptized and even gave my mother a church funeral when she died, even though she was a former party member.
With all this, I am showing a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the staffer finished reading, only the tapping of the chief&#39;s pencil on the table top broke the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me and I wished I was somewhere far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind &quot;Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans.&quot; What have I gotten myself into?
Why didn&#39;t I rather stay with the blacksmiths?
I could repair turnouts even without some messed up background check.
But now?
She took a career as a railway official before it began.
Return to the platoon?
That probably won&#39;t work, the chief will definitely kick me out for an hour.
&quot;Comrade, how did you check the comrade in question here?&quot; the chief broke the tense silence by asking the cadre.
Well, according to a reference from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
Kádrovák was obviously not out of time.
Sweat dripping down his cheeks, he blinked nervously as if he himself was being examined.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
&quot;Well,&quot; said the chief, with a hint of joviality that often heralded a storm.
At first glance, nothing but praise, he was educated with honors, he graduated from a vocational school, he worked as a locksmith on task wages, he fulfilled the standard by one hundred and twenty percent on average.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get that report, comrade?&quot; he turned again to the recruiter, who felt that things were somehow starting to turn against him and that very soon he might not even have to be a recruiter.
Here, my comrade gave it to me, upon boarding.
Was that enough for you?
&quot;Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct in the platoon,&quot; the cadre man babbled.
And there, testimonials are not required, his was somehow extra, so I put it in his folder.
&quot;So this piece of paper was enough for you when you were assigned to the technical function,&quot; stated the chief dryly.
The cadre blinked nervously and had no answer.
&quot;It&#39;s okay, we&#39;ll discuss it later,&quot; the chief closed the matter, and the cadre was obviously relieved.
For now, he&#39;s stuck it out.
&quot;So what about you, comrade?&quot; the chief turned to me again.
Suddenly I throw up, that&#39;s it!
My eyes darkened, heat poured over me.
A flood of reproaches and accusations ensued, and I knew that I was the vilest creature in the world, unworthy of the least pity.
That by pushing the incomplete report, I misled the personnel officer comrade, while I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I received it from the personnel officer at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, in the era of building real socialism, supports religious obscurantism, nay, even participates in it.
Well, there was a lot that I had done, or might still do, and I silently prayed that it would end.
I didn&#39;t care anymore.
I didn&#39;t care if I flew out of the mechanist&#39;s seat.
I didn&#39;t care if they took the pickaxe from me too.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of Comrade Chief.
&quot;That would be enough, Comrade Chief,&quot; the party chairman suddenly spoke up and emphatically interrupted the chief&#39;s levites.
Here comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, what a stupid thing he did!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don&#39;t forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than to close the door to his side for a while!
In order for them to open to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated bachelor talked like a book.
Where did it come from in him?
Is he so well read or has he parroted phrases from party training and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he&#39;s changed.
And who should give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, admittedly somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to reform!
It is your party duty that no one can take away from you!
Actually, it is the party duty of all of us as well.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one spoke.
No one expected such a turn of events.
At least me.
&quot;I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman,&quot; the chief nodded icily, trying to take the initiative again.
If you had let me finish, you would have heard that this is exactly the conclusion I was heading towards.
They all nodded their heads in agreement, but it was clear that they didn&#39;t believe a word he said.
&quot;So I&#39;ve been confirmed for the position of independent officer of the care of essential resources,&quot; I babbled as I returned to the office, and immediately burst into tears.
Besides the engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She listened silently to my incoherent recounting of recent experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I finished, she asked if I wanted a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and prepared the cups.
Meanwhile, she talked about staffing practices.
How one testimonial, often full of praise, is given to a person, and the other, which contains some dirt, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn&#39;t end up where I was supposed to, but on the side of the pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn&#39;t know where to send it.
And our staff?
He just cares where he would eat or drink, and that&#39;s how it turned out in the end.
&quot;He&#39;s getting it from the old man,&quot; she remarked maliciously.
He certainly won&#39;t like it today.
Watch out for him though, he&#39;s pretty vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe with great power.
The water for the coffee began to boil and immediately the office was filled with the smell of freshly brewed coffee.
I dropped a sugar cube into the mug and silently stirred the hot potion.
Hopefully I&#39;m out of the worst.
They won&#39;t fire me now, and the next checks are in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I won&#39;t forget today.

The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from afar because it is placed on a fifteen meter high mast.
People from the wider area call it &quot;the fan on Chlum&quot;.
For the village with 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal coat of arms, which the village acquired on the occasion of a meeting of natives in 2010.
&quot;At that time, we applied for a logo and of course we wanted to have the fan on the logo, everyone in the neighborhood knows it,&quot; stated Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a memento of the present: it reminds of the time when local people fought for quality drinking water.
It was a rarity in Chlum in past centuries.
It was not until 1910 that the representatives of Chlum decided on a solution that was then satisfactory until the mid-eighties.
They had a seven-meter-deep well dug in the village near the turnoff to Číchov.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
&quot;The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia at a cost of 2,400 crowns,&quot; says the commemorative inscription on the ground floor fence of the mast structure.
The pump reached its end of life in 1971 after several repairs and falling of the windmill.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the fight for water began to be written: on that day, a new water supply system began operating in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a non-functioning municipal symbol and a local rarity.
The Dominant was put into operation at this year&#39;s gathering of natives.
It wasn&#39;t until 2008 that the Chlums decided to repair the windmill again and put it back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced in diameter by half a meter.
The bike was mounted on a mast, but it had to be taken down the same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not withstand gusts of wind.
After that, the landmark of Chlum rested for several years, dismantled under the roof.
Since this June, however, the wheel on the tall mast has been turning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of natives, the village had a replica of the wheel modified and re-installed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel pumps service water from the well only to the overflow blind arm.
And over the summer we disconnected it completely because there was little water in the well.
At least it was idle.
&quot;In the fall, we will disconnect the windmill shaft from the pump in the suction basket again,&quot; explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where a windmill has become a municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this type in the entire Vysočina.
They have a similar element in the coat of arms in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vyškovsk Region, in Kuželov in the Hodonín Region, Partutovice in the Přerovsk Region or in Polic in the Vsetín Region.
Nothing wrong with that, but I don&#39;t know Lafata, Tripoli support Goian admitted.
&quot;I remember the match against Slavia very well, including my goal, like all in my career,&quot; smiled the 34-year-old Goian at the pre-match press conference.
At that time we were coached by Georghe Hagi, it was bad luck that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now as well.
Only with the difference that this time we won&#39;t lose,&quot; Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the raids of the Spartan offense.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybš about the Greek duel.
And he has a partial idea of what can await him on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, he played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At that time I saw all their matches.
I know he is a very good striker, that&#39;s why he also went to Sparta, said Goian.
He did not name other football players of the Prague club, so the direct question came whether he also knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and the captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and directed a slightly reproachful look at the Czech journalists.
The bewildered expression on his face indicated, &quot;Why are you asking me that?&quot;
After a moment of silence he started.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot as a team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don&#39;t know anyone else besides Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
&quot;He has experience from bigger clubs, you can say that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game,&quot; observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Although Goian&#39;s best years are already behind him, he can boast a very interesting football resume.
At one time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester teams United and City were interested in him, but from Steaua he headed to Palermo, Italy, he also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays in European cups, fights for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he is the favorite in this match, but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Just like Sparta, we will try to win, said Goian.
I am in a room with Slovakian goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very much looking forward to the opponent from the Czech Republic.
I also.
But I can say for the whole team that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola should have its new headquarters in Ostrava.
Kofola SA was registered in Poland in order to trade the company&#39;s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the headquarters of the group in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken for the time being within the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the company, says Daniel Buryš, financial director of the Kofola group.
&quot;In connection with the relocation of the group&#39;s headquarters, the shareholders are considering listing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.&quot;
In order to enter the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalizing a security prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the headquarters of the holding company and the related transfer of shares will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with the participation of only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or new investors as part of this operation.
&quot;A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - at a later date, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016,&quot; the firm said.
The company has said in the past that a potential stock offering could consist of issuing new shares or selling existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of Czech Television&#39;s objectivity in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news program of Czech Television.
And how did she hold up?
When they teach at the journalism faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can play today&#39;s broadcast of Czech Television Události.
About 80% of news coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Up until the first minute, when CT reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and euphemistically called the migrants&#39; attacks on the police officers, they ran out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-migrant propaganda was already running - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Wandering refugees - CT consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not migrant.
What is particularly striking is that CT consistently uses only and only shots of small children and women in its illustrative shots.
At the same time, she herself stated in the same broadcast that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no parallels since communist propaganda.
I must say that, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once managed to live in a block of flats, I soon stopped being the only resident.
Fish have moved into my umakart toilet.
House fishes, insects with an incomplete metamorphosis, i.e., not undergoing the transformation from a caterpillar to a beetle, and the young look like an adult, only they are tiny and gradually grow.
They were disgusting to me and I was not lazy to destroy them.
First manually and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided a kind of blue crystals for their liquidation.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or some other way?
However, it successfully disposed of them.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some kind of juvenalizer that the ants brought to the nest and then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I digress.
As time went by, insects also became objects of my admiration and I was more and more inclined to think that they have the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I learned from life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can be replaced by another.
True, with fleas and bedbugs, I probably wouldn&#39;t hesitate to make my karma worse by killing them.
In our new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fishes don&#39;t climb our necks, let them eat flakes of fallen skin, some invisible algae and the like.
After a while, their peaceful existence was disturbed by a spider.
It was a common species of woodpecker that resided on the ceiling for a long time.
We assumed that he lived off the occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found out that he feeds mainly on fish and that he apparently kept their number at a sustainable level.
Through confidential regular contact with each need performed, we found out that it was a female.
For we have witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, carefully plucking at the threads of the web so as not to be eaten before the desired copulation is achieved.
It lasted for about three days where they did not move and did not even respond to our checks.
We later found the remains of a dried male next to the female under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place.
After that, the spider didn&#39;t move for weeks.
When we thought she was done with it, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
Some of them were eaten by their mother, some of them ran away elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
We don&#39;t know if she went somewhere else or fell asleep, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the former inhabitant of the toilet.
For some time, she cautiously observed our behavior from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she evaluated our non-attack as friendship.
The numerical status of the fishes, which had increased somewhat, decreased again, and the spider calmly went about its usual activities to secure food.
Our ecosystem hasn&#39;t changed all year.
Meanwhile, our daughter reached an age where using the potty was a shame.
We have tolerated it until now, but the eternal pouring out of its contents has fed us.
We encouraged her more and more strongly to use the toilet.
However, the daughter found an excuse to keep her bad habit in that spider, which she saw very well while wiping.
She didn&#39;t take our talk about seeing a spider and having luck in the house at all.
She forced her potty by crying and yelling.
There was no point.
There came a time when the spider had to surrender, in the interests of the daughter&#39;s development.
It was left to me.
He was caught in a glass and banished over the balcony to somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but still, after living together for so long, I felt disgusting, as if I were throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fish would start to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometric series.
It&#39;s amazing, for a week or two, we haven&#39;t seen any of them there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the spider had somehow cultivated them there, following the pattern of ants, that the environment of the toilet was not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they swarmed again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured that their attachment to the spider must have been because when they can&#39;t see it, it&#39;s hidden in some other place and they&#39;re in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection with their predator and its rapid disappearance caused some kind of alarm response.
Especially since I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some light shyness, but not that they would react to waving hands or quick movements.
My daughter already goes to the toilet regularly.
I think she forgot the potty.
All that remains is to attract another spider.
I&#39;m already broadcasting my wishes to the airwaves and hope they don&#39;t resent me after the foreclosure.
Otherwise we would have to use the Zyklon B.
Albert Einstein&#39;s ten sayings that enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to delve so deeply into everything that the result was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He brought his special and general theory of relativity to people&#39;s attention, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
His clarification of the photo effect or the idea of electromagnetic field quantization cannot be neglected either.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complicated for many that they prefer easy comparisons for a closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it wouldn&#39;t be Albert Einstein if he didn&#39;t find an ingeniously simplified form of explanation for this too: A watch near your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour - and that&#39;s relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing these ten from his entire galaxy of famous quotes that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to make them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I&#39;m not so sure about the first one.
No amount of trying could ever prove me right.
However, only one can prove me wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the clutter on the table is a reflection of the clutter in the mind, then what does the empty desk reflect?
I don&#39;t know what World War III will be fought with, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
There are a thousand ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and so is knowing much.
If I had an hour to tackle a problem on which my life depended, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not mentioning Einstein&#39;s formula for the definition of success: If we take A as success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are awaiting changes worth 1.5 billion.
&quot;It&#39;s a success when we consider that all four have been in the black this whole year,&quot; stated the governor Stanislav Mišák with satisfaction.
The total profit of the regional facilities at this moment is about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher payments from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year as well.
This fact also shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford larger investments.
As a result, construction is approaching in Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we mainly bought devices is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them it is impossible to provide high-quality health care, explained the regional deputy for health care Lubomír Nečas.
They are looking forward to the changes in all hospitals.
The builders will come to the hospitals already next year.
In Vsetín, they are now selecting a supplier for a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
They have a dialysis extension planned in Kroměříž.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new internal building to the central pavilion that opened this year for around 200 million.
And the long-delayed construction of a new central reception and internment center awaits the Zlín Bať hospital, which will require three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
&quot;For the entire region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step,&quot; declared hospital director Věra Prousková, for example, regarding the construction of the Vsetín intern.
The five-story building there should be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for interns and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
The changes, which are mainly noticeable by patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many sick people lie in one room, they have, for example, only one toilet per floor, the beds are not adjustable, the windows are leaky and the health workers do not have adequate working conditions.
&quot;For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and now it is at the limit of its useful life,&quot; pointed out the director of the Zlín hospital, Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-story modern building connected to an urgent income.
Doctors and patients will thus have all emergency departments in one place, moreover in new premises.
The same model is already half finished in Uherské Hradiště.
The central reception is already standing and an internal reception will be added to it within three years.
&quot;We will pay for the building with a loan and partly with our own funds,&quot; explained director Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one in the region that can afford its own financing.
Its profit is still the highest, and it did not make a loss even two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital faced a loss of almost two hundred million.
&quot;We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs in the entire hospital,&quot; mentioned Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
The patients of the Kroměříž hospital will also see improvement.
Over ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new devices and renovations.
Already this year, the repair of the interception station will be completed, then the dialysis extension will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging will begin.
Management of regional hospitals

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains after meeting with his European colleagues that the other Czech states are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they don&#39;t want to live here anyway.
&quot;We didn&#39;t get an answer, and that&#39;s why we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text,&quot; Chovanec told reporters.
Can you more specifically describe the position with which you came to the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the member states if they were to redistribute themselves.
We can&#39;t imagine it.
We did not receive an answer and therefore wanted the quotas to be removed from the final text.
We have no problem with the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things.
We&#39;ve been talking about this for a year and we&#39;ve been saying this is the way to go.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we were dealing with forty thousand, now it is one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in that area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to join us, we simply don&#39;t know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, have the ambition to come to us, and obtain asylum here, but the interest of people from this wave of migration, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is borderline close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don&#39;t even want to come to us, but we have already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn&#39;t it be possible to receive more of them this way?
We undertook to accept 1,500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that 1,100 people will come, with whom we will handle the asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility and we will treat them the same way we treat them.
It is a big question, and we will debate it with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe treats it in such a way that if they have a registration, they cannot be detained.
This means that they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement, which is not yet in place, it may happen that we will not even keep the 1,100 in the territory of the Czech Republic, and they will go to Germany again after their arrival.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will complete the asylum procedure with them.
If they are citizens of Syria or Eritrea, almost 98 percent of them receive international protection according to European statistics.
Then they get documents that allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in destination countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will be relocating.
That&#39;s the second project that&#39;s going on so far, and we&#39;ve only progressed there in that we&#39;re debating with the churches about the possibility of helping them find jobs, housing, and so on.
But that&#39;s a very long shot.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
Isn&#39;t it the case that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but does not offer any solidarity step that would unblock the discussion?
And what kind of solidarity step do you think it should be?
If the Federal Republic of Germany gives an incentive that all migrants from Syria can come to them, the news spreads within hours to all the camps in Europe, but also in Turkey and Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration to Germany because they simply don&#39;t want to come to us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage the waves of migration, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Make it clear to them that they don&#39;t stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year alone.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, courts, prosecutor&#39;s offices.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economy, then fifty percent of what the social systems waste on them today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it&#39;s eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far does it have to go to make border controls even tighter?
We were afraid of the capture of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacant places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, we will return all the people we detain to Austria within seven days.
We do this by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take those people from us, it&#39;s complicated with Hungary and the Greeks - that&#39;s a completely useless story.
So where is the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day for two or three consecutive days will deplete our capacities so much that crisis plans will be put in place.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an emergency government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If that situation were to arise, the government could de facto sit down immediately and, with one resolution, decide to strengthen the police with the army, let&#39;s say the customs administration, or the prison service.
The last option is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don&#39;t think it can get this far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we only have the Schengen border at the airport.
I don&#39;t know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don&#39;t want to spread alarmist information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, indicates rather that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
It would affect the Czech Republic very marginally, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debts at the last minute.
They are trying to avoid declaring bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid its debts.
Football players also received their money.
Football Slavia appeared before the court for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after the Online Services company from Pacific Samoa filed a proposal for it for around 20 million crowns.
Slavia&#39;s legal representative Zuzana Mládková tried to convince judge Michaela Wenzlova within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy for Slavia.
And it must be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the week before last Slavia became the new owner of the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC, as well as the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money arrived at the club from the new owners, and at the last minute.
This is also proven by Slavia&#39;s statement before Tuesday&#39;s court hearing - the Vršovice club sent tens of millions of crowns owed on Monday, just one day before the court hearing.
&quot;Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15,&quot; said legal representative Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
To current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or Czech midfielder Mario Liček.
Slavia also paid a fee to agent Alexandr Losenicke.
Already on Friday, the club paid the outstanding fees of the Prague 10 district.
De facto, only claims that Slavia disputes remain part of the insolvency dispute.
According to the club, either the given obligations did not arise at all, or there are legal disputes about them.
However, we are ready to pay the amounts in case of losing these disputes.
&quot;We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove with an account statement,&quot; attorney Mládková told the judge.
&quot;Everything that was overdue has been paid,&quot; Mládková declared, adding that only outstanding or conflicting obligations have not been paid.
It is also certain that the judge will not make a decision in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had indeed paid the said debts.
Subsequently, all evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the continuation of the hearing on November 3.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting either, but only in writing after it.

Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and more profit.
It is this year&#39;s novelty, which premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honors, as they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world&#39;s leading manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameter management, FastMig X belongs to the world&#39;s top.
The delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly pleasant for those interested.
We have already established the first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand even more after the Brno fair.
We have been his regular participants for over twenty years, and our business results are almost always better after him than before, Miroslav Streichsbier, manager of the Kemppi store in Pilsen, emphasizes for the ARC-H company.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blank could be built so that it would not collapse.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
The blank could have been punched more safely, says the expert.
It was possible to build the Blanka tunnel complex in such a way that two earth subsidences did not occur in Prague&#39;s Stromovka, according to Alexandr Butovič, the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel.
He said this early Wednesday evening during a press tour of the tunnel.
However, according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It will open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It&#39;s always a compromise between price and security.
&quot;The tunnel could have been excavated more safely, but the costs are growing exponentially,&quot; Butovič said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the ground caved in just a few steps from where he began to dig using a safer and more cautious method.
&quot;If those measures had been used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive,&quot; said Butovič.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010, the ground collapsed near the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the Euro weekly.
According to the original plan, the construction was supposed to cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add VAT, which jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one out of seventeen billion.
If technology, land purchases and engineering activity, valorization and similar items are added to this, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37 again, said Bělohlav
Someone ordered that and paid for it.

FedEx earnings mixed, cut fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for the latest quarter and a huge cut in its full-year profit forecast due to weak freight demand and higher costs for its ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company&#39;s shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the open on Wednesday.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The lowered outlook comes despite a 4.9 percent increase in interest rates on average, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit to grow from a year ago due to cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
The company&#39;s chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, said the company &quot;delivered solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade.&quot;
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 more workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share came in at $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share forecast by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But a boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx&#39;s ground unit.
Ground revenue rose 29 percent in the latest quarter, but operating profit was essentially flat due to higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit saw higher income due to higher base rates, while profit declined in the freight business due to higher labor costs.
FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15 in premarket trading about an hour before the open.
They ended Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below their June 11 record.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table, deciding whether, after nearly a decade, the time has come to raise the key interest rate.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation&#39;s economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize American employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to a predictable decision to be announced Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch as it unwinds from the unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since the end of 2008.
Although most data points to solid economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could spook the already cautious Fed into adding to volatility by raising its benchmark federal funds rate - by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
&quot;Obviously the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first and foremost,&quot; said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
&quot;But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them enough justification to wait further,&quot; she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing jitters in financial markets.
About half of economists recently polled by Blomberg expected a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to hold off on the matter, with the key indicator only about a 30% chance of a hike.
That would point to a downside for the stock market if the Fed raises rates, only if policymakers soften the plunge by promising that no more hikes are in the offing.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will keep rates calm this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody&#39;s Capital Markets Research Group.
&quot;It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now,&quot; he says.
If Fed policymakers were to do that, &quot;they would have to go to extremes in their policy statement and hold the financial markets&#39; hands so they don&#39;t panic.&quot;
Other experts said a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared on track to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects to raise rates this year through the spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of picking up.
And while inflation continues to run below the central bank&#39;s annual 2% target, Fed policymakers say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy &quot;can handle higher rates and needs them given the tight labor market,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to tumble late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors worried that China&#39;s slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, and the Dow is now only about 10% off its May high.
The unsettled situation on the market provides Fed policymakers with a complex calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
&quot;Absent what happened in the financial markets and reports of weakness in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would have been some tightening at this meeting,&quot; said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former official Fed.
He now predicts they will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the consequences.
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of uncertainty about what impact this is going to have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to go by on the latest developments in China,&quot; Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed&#39;s main concerns, so technically it shouldn&#39;t factor into their decision making.
But in reality the Fed has become the monetary authority of the entire world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might &quot;taper&quot; their monetary expansion in the market set off convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is &quot;more art than science,&quot; said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that &quot;the Fed has a history of excessive moves in financial markets that seem disconnected from economic fundamentals.&quot;
Lacker, a voting policymaking member of the Federal Open Market Committee that pushed for rate hikes, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three sessions &quot;Despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US,&quot; said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should prioritize financial stability concerns only during a major crisis like the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England&#39;s rate-setting committee.
The latest uproar doesn&#39;t even come close to that level, he said.
&quot;You certainly don&#39;t want to be in a situation of fearing a rate hike because the markets got upset,&quot; said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and doesn&#39;t mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don&#39;t think they should come out on top.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it&#39;s Chinatown and not Thaitown.
The Market/Warehouse is a one-stop shop offering a stunning array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There&#39;s even an automotive section if you need some motor oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to walk through all the aisles.
If you&#39;re hungry from all that shopping, grab a bite to eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The indoor trade stand (good, cheap) is near the registers and has various collection points.
What&#39;s in Stock: Need something - anything - Thai?
At LAX-C, you can probably find it.
Items are affordable and many items are sold in bulk.
Mez fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is great, for example fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and debone it for you, even fry it for you if you wish,
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you&#39;ll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter deli meats and more.
Who Shops Here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
Wide aisles accommodate shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Speed on highways will remain the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House of Representatives.
On selected highway sections, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
This was the decision of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, when it acceded to an amendment proposed by the Senate, which rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Road Traffic Act will now go to the President.
President Miloš Zeman already said at the end of April that he would veto the law allowing a speed of 150 kilometers.
The Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for ANO) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech highway network is not yet built for such a speed.
Ťok supported the senate version of the law in front of the deputies on Tuesday.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane roads.
The Chamber of Deputies first extended this option to highways, on which it would be possible to drive at speeds of up to 150 km/h in selected sections, but the Senate rejected it.
The MPs have now accepted his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the authority of the traffic police to have the last word in the modification of local roads, which are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the Chamber of Deputies, also provides for sewage, water pipes or public lighting cables to be laid lengthwise under the road surface.
Municipalities would thus save money on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be required to take care of roadside vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles whose owners do not report.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles whose owners do not apply for them within a six-month period after notification of the towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on second and third class roads under the threat of fines for forwarding companies as well.
The amendment also cancels the possibility of introducing electronic highway signs instead of the existing paper ones, which will thus be used even after January 1 next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí expressor goes to court.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcoming of citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced Welcoming Citizens project.
The police also wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailova (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her.
According to the legal classification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The main trial is currently scheduled for two days in October.
According to the public prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The plaintiff relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city management, by virtue of their position, unlawfully allowed the company that organized the welcoming of the citizens to obtain a financial benefit.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the municipal department of municipal services, education and culture to approach five connected companies in the tender process.
When another company entered the competition that offered the lowest price, the city hall canceled the competition.
The city was then supposed to entrust the contract to the administrator, and only Darothore entered the competition, to which the city council then awarded the contract.
The city paid out at least an extra million.
Both accused, led by the aim of securing for the Darothore company the award of a public contract for the organization of the Welcoming Citizens event in Ústí nad Labem, acted in a long-term and coordinated manner, at least contrary to the requirement to proceed with the care of a proper householder, writes the public prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that the company Darothore would subsequently bill Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the Welcoming Citizens event, which would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, roughly 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to an expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least one million crowns.
Mandík has previously denied any violation of the law.
I have not committed any crime, I am innocent.
I don&#39;t understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was organized by the Roxy II agency.
&quot;It was under the same conditions, for the same money,&quot; added Mandík.
Criminal investigators originally wanted to charge MP Kailová, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her for prosecution.
Therefore, criminal investigators postponed the case in her case, but they expect that Kailová will be charged after her parliamentary mandate ends.
Welcoming citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children&#39;s supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers allegedly released a dog on the fugitive.
Then they made the journalist delete the recording.
It is said that the Hungarian police briefly detained a cameraman of the AP agency on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete the recording in which a police dog allegedly knocked a refugee to the ground.
But the Hungarian government disputes this accusation.
The alleged incident happened Saturday night as AP cameraman Luca Muzi was filming migrants crossing the border into Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The police took action against the refugees and one of them let a dog with a basket on its snout attack a certain Syrian.
The dog knocked down the man who shouted &quot;Please, please, I&#39;m a refugee,&quot; Muzi claims.
One of the police officers noticed that Muzi was filming everything and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was then no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The officers took Muzi to a dark place near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
They then ordered him to delete the recording.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days&#39; work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
AP sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
In it, she described the behavior of police officers as unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and without having to fear that the government would destroy legally obtained material.
Referring to the police report, Kovács disputed Muzi&#39;s account of events.
He said the officers just wanted the journalist to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they had the right to do.
When they found out they weren&#39;t there, they didn&#39;t force him to delete anything.
&quot;Dogs can bark - they are trained to deter and instill a bit of fear, but not to attack for sure,&quot; Kovács claims.
Unpredictable Champions League.
A win against City will give us a kick, Juventus believes
&quot;It&#39;s disappointing, I don&#39;t think we deserved to lose,&quot; Manuel Pellegrini, the home coach of City, shook his head.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team created many chances, but we had more of the ball.
&quot;The reason for the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals,&quot; said Pellegrini, whose team conceded in the competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
Last season&#39;s finalist Juventus was in the exact opposite situation before the meeting - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, the defending champions have only one point and with a score of 2:4 they are only in 16th place in the table.
That is why the turnaround at the Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
&quot;This win will help us mentally, it will give us a kick,&quot; believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three mainstays - Pirlo, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Mandzukic and Morata.
&quot;That&#39;s right, this victory is very important, maybe thanks to it we will start a winning wave,&quot; hopes Morata.
Because when we are on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attacking phase.
My players deserve this result.
&quot;Before our equalizing goal, we could have conceded at 0:2, but Gianluigi held us up,&quot; coach Allegri praised goalkeeper Buffon.
&quot;We wasted some good chances,&quot; lamented City midfielder Yaya Touré.
We have to learn from the Champions League and try for a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all the media hype around is driven by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
And so let&#39;s stop for a moment.
Today, the newspapers and media are full of children being carried by their parents on the dusty paths of the exodus.
And that automatically causes a person - that is, a European person - to feel guilt and pity.
Well, they&#39;re not just desperate little kids who come here, notice in the footage of the boats landing at the Greek islands that there&#39;s not much of a kid to be seen on them!
Well, somehow the images of boats heading for Lampedusa, of refugees from the French border near Menton, where thousands of young men lie on the beautiful promenades, have disappeared from our television lately.
Largely young black men.
And also gone are the pictures from Callais where these black men are eating and waiting to see if they can get through the Channel Tunnel.
He probably doesn&#39;t care anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
There was too much falsity sticking out of it.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow hidden that it is not only unfortunate children from Syria, but also stylish - for the elderly: fashionably dressed - young men.
Whose musculature looks like they just got out of some gym.
Just one personal experience to add to that.
This summer in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus, we lay on the hotel&#39;s private beach.
Regardless of the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And out of them came young black men.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They walked onto the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In hands, of course, smartphones.
They didn&#39;t care that it was a private beach, and the staff - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They occupied all the sunbeds.
Anyone who didn&#39;t lie on it and was in the sea was out of luck.
They were dressed like from an American rapper movie.
Caps with nails on their heads, white and colored adidas shoes on their feet.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started feasting.
They occupied the tables around, crammed to the brown and white guests of the bar sitting next to them - read Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace to somewhere quiet.
Arriving black people drank beer straight out of thirds - like in the series from the USA?! - they were throwing empty bottles around on the beach.
They were constantly shouting loudly at each other.
However, it was not in English.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimwear, especially the young ladies -, screaming and yelling in the water, mothers with children and pensioners fled in terror, and in half an hour there was not a single non-black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was Christian or Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice that evening, &quot;Did you see that gold they were wearing?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said.
&quot;Well, they certainly didn&#39;t have it from work,&quot; said the waiter.
I remembered, “I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive gold cross about twenty centimeters around his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
&quot;Are they drug smugglers?&quot; I asked.
&quot;You&#39;ve seen them drinking,&quot; replied the waiter.
They do not smuggle or use drugs.
They are smuggling something completely different.
So it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it wasn&#39;t that important to me yet.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known this first.
I don&#39;t think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and go and go.
Today it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-politically-correct politicians, as it were intellectuals and the lobbyist and economically important groups linked to them have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now publicly recognized as the main power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the leaders of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, the recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are on the level of Moscow television images from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but mainly - old German - Muslims welcomed their namesakes.
For many weeks, they blathered on in the news on Czech TV, saying that, according to some research, almost all Germans are in favor of the arrival of emigrants.
But anyone who has only been in Germany for a few days knows that this is a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by other information.
For example, the famous public opinion research organized by ARD - in Czech the Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD claim, just a week ago more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
This was also reported by our televisions.
However, they hid what broke in Germany the next day: that a poll on the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans do not want any more immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, i.e. five years ago: &quot;Our quest for a &#39;multi-cult&#39; society has totally failed.&quot;
She then said: &quot;Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.&quot;
&quot;All efforts for such a coexistence have totally failed.&quot;
According to her, in a country where four million Muslims live, the strategy of allowing people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has not worked. Today they live here with us and for some time we lied to ourselves that they would not stay, that one day they would disappear again.
But that is not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we think that we just live happily next to each other, this approach has failed.
He failed miserably.
But even Merkel probably doesn&#39;t have the strength to go against the powers of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This is shown by the escalation of events.
The conflict escalates rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, Member of Parliament for the SPD, the only one in the European Parliament who allegedly does not even have a high school diploma - yes, that&#39;s the one about whom Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play warden in a concentration camp any minute -, as he has done many times before demonstrated.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements of German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Let&#39;s note that, except for a few, most European politicians do not support these statements, statesmen of countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who for years tried, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those right who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is sown in the soul of Germany?
Was chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he used all his might to stop the attempts of the Great Germans to dominate the entire center of Europe?
When did he say that the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he should have.
When it was shut down, preparations for World War 1 began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, has probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt of Marxists to take over the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany based on, for example, ecology, which was one of the main ideological doctrines of Nazism, by the way.
We would say sunshine.
For a long time, the German elites resisted the emergence of German nationalism, so they left alone all those fighters against the atom, enthusiasts seeking a paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people everywhere in the world who want to do something different and better, fully side with the anti-global warming campaigners, stop nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this current there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current that considers all Slavs to be difficult recruits - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his Jewish parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as shown by the latest statements of Schulz and German ministers openly threatening disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leadership Germany.
Which must be listened to without apology.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we mix in the fact that immigrants are a very impressionable group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind it, as always, is capital, especially German capital, which is comfortable and thrives on the fact that Germany actually controls most of the countries of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-belief of the sun worshipers first led the Germans into the swamps of environmentalism and multiculturalism, and today it has brought home and will probably bring millions of Muslims home.
Who, lured by the voices of sirens, will soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see, and start to riot.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, once again it can drive a part of its population - but as it seems, an increasingly smaller part - ideologically crazy, but in the end reality will catch up with it, as always.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are already burning.
What will the German government do when public protests by Germans against incoming Islamists break out?
To whom will Muslims who have long been living in Germany, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws, come to their aid?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans fearing the Islamization of their country get into a fight?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superman Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict that it provoked in Europe by supporting the sunshine ideology, i.e. an elitist and basically totalitarian ideology, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt treatment of the recalcitrant democratic Germans and all the inferior and recalcitrant eastern neighbors, things cannot go well for them.

The best way to get rid of nosy salespeople: scare them to death.
All you have to do is knock and the robust knocker will come down on you in a way that the weak-minded may not be able to withstand.
A lively head will wipe you out nicely and drive away even stubborn ones, and an animated statue will accompany (or rather drive away) an insistent salesman on his way away.
Maybe it&#39;s a shame that you can&#39;t actually buy a talking knocker.
It would also be useful for warding off a lot of peepers and scumbags.
Horned sorrel (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates dry conditions.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that, although it belongs to expansive weeds, makes a nice appearance in terms of flowering.
It is located between the outdoor tiles.
It is unpredictable, it thrives in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, is easily adaptable, modest and undemanding.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is still worth observing and photographing.
Under the microscope, the beauty of the detail can only be found - yellow flowers and green leaves, also with a purple accompaniment.
The Rio Grande Pediatric Society of Brazil promotes a healthy diet while breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to educate women about the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding, using pictures of babies sucking from breasts painted with images of junk food.
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are recommended to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that the healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic makeup of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected children&#39;s immune systems.
Seven&#39;s Sunrise dominates the ratings, although Nine&#39;s is trying to take the lead on the Today Show
Karel Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson&#39;s dash to Canberra to cover the costs of the Liberal leadership leak failed to create enough of a ratings boost for Today.
Nine&#39;s morning show broadcast from the nation&#39;s capital following Malcolm Turnbull&#39;s ouster by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, jammed London as part of a week-long international telecast that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance didn&#39;t seem to matter as much to Aussie TV viewers as it averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities compared to Today&#39;s 330,000 viewers.
Today saw a slight increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their numbers were only behind last Thursday&#39;s (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise&#39;s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than just Parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thanks for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move to seaside New Zealand with his two children is averaging a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered whether Thomson would be able to pull off a hit TV single without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening indicates a clear &quot;yes&quot;.
Seven&#39;s The X Factor retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, handily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings for the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz (5pm to 5.30pm) presented by Andrew O&#39;Keefe&#39; averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5:30 to 6 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers — enough for a narrow victory over Eddie McGuire&#39;s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
With The Chase Australia&#39;s ratings dip from night two, Nine will be confident the Hot Seat will eventually win at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia is being replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire&#39;s show.

The final three agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will she choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who will win The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood will be dating on The Bachelor is shrouded in an insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who remain will definitely not reveal who is the one who will get the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they were down to just two, they inadvertently tipped us off as to who would win.
Sam Wood is keeping his mouth shut until Thursday&#39;s final
All three women waxed lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, &quot;If not, who gets Wood&#39;s final flower?&quot;, their answers could serve as a spoiler for who will win the Bachelor&#39;s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the best fit for Wood apart from them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood shared an easy relationship from day one.
&quot;From the moment I walked into the house and observed Sarah and Sam&#39;s energy, I felt they were quite compatible, and I still think so throughout the course,&quot; says Jeavons-Fellows.
&quot;Sarah is a really down-to-earth woman, she&#39;s a lot of fun,&quot; added Markoski.
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry.
They are good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For herself, she claims that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood might be &quot;the one.&quot;
&quot;As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game anymore - I opened my whole heart to him now,&quot; she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked puzzled.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can say that,&quot; she said.
I like both girls equally - it&#39;s a tie between Snezena and Lana.
Bachelor airs on Wednesdays at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams inquired after his great start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a smart decision.
Some coaches have sat Hayne for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which the Australian rugby league convert made on the first kick-off in Tuesday&#39;s 20-3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he has faith in the player and gave him another chance to come back and fill in after Reggie Bush&#39;s injury.
Tomsula also continued to be candid in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing out the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly in the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman stated that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and just worry about the next play.
Already during the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn&#39;t the start Hayne and his massive Aussie fan club had hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught cursing as he walked off the field after the foul and later told Australian radio duo Hamish &amp; Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 the worse start to his NFL career he could imagine.
&quot;That&#39;s what happens, you just focus on the next game and that&#39;s it,&quot; Hayne said
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a tackle in his own goal area led to Queensland&#39;s three.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russia&#39;s Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia&#39;s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated, and his democratic efforts curtailed.
The ÚS stood up for emigrants who were demanding property compensation.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court initially awarded them the required amount, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but the appeals court changed their claim by awarding them only less than 90 thousand crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the price regulations from 1991.
The Supreme Court defended the emigrants and awarded them the originally sued amount.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, filed a complaint with the ÚS.
In the meantime, social and economic conditions have changed to such an extent that the compensation awarded according to the then valid legal regulations - even though it was then adequate compensation in relation to the property taken - today only amounts to a fraction of the value of the property.
&quot;This cannot go to the burden of the intervening parties as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been demanding their rights since at least 1995 and who did not have the opportunity to obtain compensation earlier,&quot; explained judge-reporter Jaroslav Fenyk, why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
&quot;The Court of Justice has repeatedly spoken out in favor of general courts proceeding in restitution matters in such a way that possible inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. reparation of property injustice caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state,&quot; the judge added.
Evita will now be played by Radka Fišarová in the Studio DVA musical.
By the way, Radka Fišarová became the world&#39;s youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spirála Theater in Prague.
On returning to the same role, she says: &quot;To this day, not many performances have matched Evita&#39;s demandingness.&quot;
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monika Absolonová recommended her for the role of First Lady of Argentina.
I saw Monča in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Here I suddenly saw a completely new concept.
I&#39;m quite a fan of more modern edits, but this one is just particularly good.
&quot;Ondřej Sokol&#39;s direction is original, light and contemporary,&quot; notes Fišarová.
The imaginary handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolonová&#39;s birthday concert on September 27 from 7 p.m. in the Studio DVA theater.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The joint duet Don&#39;t Cry For Me Argentina will surely be part of the experience.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also step away from the director&#39;s desk, when he will replace Karel Roden in the role of President Perón during the filming of the film.
Due to public interest, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the Studio DVA theater in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Under the direction of Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally performed by Monika Absolonová.
By her side, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and Peter Strenáčik in the role of Che.
Legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra under the direction of Kryštof Marek, who was already involved in the first performance at the Spirála Theater.
4 people killed after police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters against a proposed new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district officer, says more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, with some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal says police fired tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused the high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across Nepal&#39;s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under a proposed new constitution and eroded their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal were also seen by the Tharus ethnic group, who are demanding their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, have been killed in violent clashes since August 10.
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step toward a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu this week voted on the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly mustn&#39;t panic now.
After the loss on the ice of the champion Litvínov, you didn&#39;t even manage the home duel with Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Aren&#39;t you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the extra league like a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

The NHC predicts a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming into a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc ( GOOGL.O ) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for aid organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries. Google will double every amount you withdraw.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud published the news on her blog based on personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family as a seven-year-old.
&quot;We traveled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,&quot; said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match all contributions made through google.com/refugerelief up to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them come from Syria, torn by a four-year war, which displaced 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to tell whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those given non-surgical treatment.
&quot;Mortality figures take a long time to show,&quot; says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote the editorial for the new JAMA Surgery study.
Weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery uses different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done on morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates a person is overweight, and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study looking at two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and gastrectomy -- in type 3 diabetes treatments in people who were moderately obese.
The average BMI among those who had the surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, for comparison, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and only partially in about 2 percent of patients.
Also, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol was shown to be &quot;generally better in the surgical group,&quot; the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient&#39;s blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the body&#39;s ongoing blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, researchers say.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drug-treated group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better &quot;glycemic control&quot; -- reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels -- did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery.
After five years, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1), and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after the surgery, Blackstone said this is a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
&quot;That&#39;s where this work is critical because it shows that surgery is safer in the lower BMI group,&quot; without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also goes on to say that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a patient&#39;s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
&quot;I think we&#39;re waiting too long to let people know the gravity of the situation,&quot; he says.
I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes that hardwire their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe&quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in refugees&#39; home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also emphasized that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,&quot; he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in solving the crisis, he emphasized that it is only a temporary solution.
&quot;Taking care of a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through education in these Muslim countries,&quot; he stressed.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,&quot; he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that &quot;the violent US response set off a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences,&quot; the Dalai Lama said.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested the sanitizing agent in the last 4 years
Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed high-alcohol sanitizer, according to a Georgia poison control center.
According to Dr. According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, the number of ingestions of sanitation products by children under 12 reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
&quot;Kids are coming into these products more often, and unfortunately there is a percentage of kids that have to be taken to the emergency room,&quot; Lopez told CNN.
Some kids drink the sanitizer on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap thrill.
The teenagers allegedly mixed the sanitiser with mouthwash containing alcohol to make a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive scent of the product.
&quot;Kids don&#39;t think about the fact that it could hurt them,&quot; Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
Sanitizing products with strawberry, grapefruit or orange scents are available, which are very attractive to children.
Sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, a few locks can mean alcohol poisoning.
&quot;This is highly concentrated alcohol,&quot; University of Kansas Hospital Poison Control Center Medical Director Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn&#39;t just leave a glass of whiskey lying around either, but people leave these sanitary products outside and when children get to them, it&#39;s a fast track to alcohol consumption.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed up to four scoops of strawberry-scented sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold for intoxication in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and unable to walk after she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children&#39;s hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head due to the alcohol, Ritchey reports.
&quot;It was very scary,&quot; Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah&#39;s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or keep hand sanitizer out of children&#39;s reach.
Outside of alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methanol, the deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their &#39;evil&#39; teacher by spreading antibacterial products around the room,&quot; according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitizing agents and has forbidden their presence in the room.
Police dismissed the foiled plan as &quot;innocent chatter,&quot; citing school district discipline.
Rumor: No discord in the Celtic squad
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony at Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place but he turns it around again.
Hearts will battle the SFA against a raid on Neilson and Warburton is concerned the new January signings will disrupt squad unity.
The Dons extend their lead over Celtic by 5 points
ADAM Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, putting the Dons five points clear of themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of a mismatch
The situation has sparked rumors of discord at Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists he and his team-mates are not working under any pressure from the heightened scrutiny in the build-up to the clash with the Dutch league leaders.
I don&#39;t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Shortage in Scottish title rivalry bores Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claims Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no title rivalry between them anymore.
De Boer, who is currently an ambassador for Ajax, states: &quot;They don&#39;t show highlights of Celtic games in the Netherlands anymore, and why?&quot;
Because the Rangers are no longer there.
People here aren&#39;t just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He&#39;s talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that&#39;s what they&#39;re interested in.
There&#39;s a lot of tension at Old Firm matches and it&#39;s not just people from Scotland who watch these games.
I will turn things back to good, Deila vows.
ROONY Dealia has admitted Celtic are stumbling a bit but the Norway boss has vowed to turn things around.
Defeat by Malmö and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was quickly followed by defeat against Aberdeen, who had just 10 men and now sit five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila says: &quot;Celtic have had bad times before and they will rise again.&quot;
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it&#39;s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about what&#39;s going on right now.
We are exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic&#39;s support because it makes the players so much better.
Now it is very important to stay together.
Warburton is concerned about January signings
Despite comments emerging a few weeks ago suggesting he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of major signings and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The former Brentford boss states: &quot;The January transfer window is very different to the summer one.&quot;
Players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season to settle in, which you&#39;ve seen in our own squad this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic transfer target Micha hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who has been linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire when his Swansea contract expires.
The 20-year-old marksman has struggled with a prone ankle for two years and has failed to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts were leading 2–1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3–2, but the defender&#39;s red card was later overturned - the third red card issued by referee Collum to be overturned.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating, &quot;I didn&#39;t question the integrity, I didn&#39;t comment on the performance.&quot;
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after he admitted singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh ahead of the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014
&quot;It was a derby and it was a heated moment,&quot; the forward said, continuing: &quot;I can safely say I won&#39;t be coming back to Tynecastle unless it&#39;s in a Celtic shirt.&quot;
Tannadice Council believes in Dundee United - Donelly management
Simon Donelly insists the Dundee United board still believe in fixing the situation with the team&#39;s current management - but admits the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We&#39;ll get the boys ready for action again,&quot; promises Donnelly.
MCInnes is happy for the &quot;ugly win&quot; against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to hang on desperately against Hamilton Accies to secure a seventh consecutive league win and move five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty.
McInnes states: &quot;There is not a team that has won anything, be it cups or leagues, without winning these types of games.&quot;
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged, while overall UK unemployment rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of people out of work in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland&#39;s unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK rate (5.5 per cent), figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: &quot;The Government&#39;s long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.&quot;
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
This 12 months saw further improvement in the labor market, with Scottish employment rising while unemployment fell.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite a late legal intervention, I will be watching a man be put to death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn&#39;t, I will be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials to witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I start to dread it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I thought it would be a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is held to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of press slots from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the entire execution dispassionately.
I can&#39;t do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip&#39;s closest friends and I have formed a special bond with him over months of phone calls and one two and a half hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can&#39;t be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won&#39;t be allowed a notepad and I won&#39;t be able to record what I see.
I&#39;ll just have to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is the lesson.
Tell the inmate&#39;s story the way he likes it, gain access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she &quot;could have phrased it better,&quot; but she still thinks what I&#39;m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip took issue with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn&#39;t tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn&#39;t listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I won&#39;t repeat all the details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of being an accessory to the crime.
But I believe there is a high probability that he is innocent of murder.
I definitely believe that not enough evidence was presented to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion the execution is bad.
And it is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can&#39;t say that I will be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you will get from me is the experience of seeing someone I love die a needless death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
A Canning Vale constable has been kept dry after freeing a man from Canning River.
A Petrh man&#39;s bet to escape the police failed after he ended up in shallow muddy water just meters from a police officer who tried to coax him back to shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called to the incident extending into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn&#39;t get far.
&quot;He was standing in the water saying &#39;I&#39;m not going out, just come get me,&#39;&quot; Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec didn&#39;t want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use the safer tactic of police negotiation.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes people try to do funny things when they escape,&quot; Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins sets a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired locals to start planning the Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organizers tried to spy on him and is threatening to end the races
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He targeted organizers and Racing Victoria&#39;s integrity department, believing they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai&#39;s late scratch during race day maintenance, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation regarding Lidar&#39;s positive smear for cobalt, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about the spying allegations for 18 months and didn&#39;t want it to look like &quot;dry grapes.&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out at once,&quot; Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I will go home today and get a good night&#39;s sleep.
I want to walk with my head held high and for the owners to think that I am doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn&#39;t be a coach anymore.
I would have to consider what to do with my license after that.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on him.
&quot;Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him employment in my stables in exchange for finding out information about things that were going on in my stables,&quot; Moody said to Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that&#39;s the case, they should all come forward with their information because they absolutely burned out trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of this today.
Should I think it&#39;s becoming personal?
Will the RVL grow some balls and get people outside the coaching ranks to take responsibility for what&#39;s going on in the industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I&#39;m saying now will give them food for thought.
But I&#39;ve gotten to the point where it doesn&#39;t matter anymore and I&#39;m sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can walk away.
The trainer&#39;s frustration levels have risen with the long-running investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and the recent scratch left him feeling like he &quot;could put his license on the table.&quot;
Mood, best known for training unbeaten champion Black Caviar, has branded the race day treatment rule &quot;ridiculous&quot; after the horse had a clay poultice or mud applied to its legs, which is against the rules.
It&#39;s against the racing rules.
I have to take full responsibility for that,&quot; he said.
Someone from my team accidentally put mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating the tiles on the day of the race, into which the organizers have already opened an investigation.
It&#39;s a joke.
The people who make these rules don&#39;t know anything about horses.
&quot;We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,&quot; Moody said.
The Cobra driver who sped away was arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend and drove off after the collision.
A cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove off without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, the 50-year-old Nathalia man turned himself in to Shepparton police.
He is expected to be charged with failure to stop at an accident, failure to render aid and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable condition in hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has slammed his players&#39; tackles as &quot;scheduling&quot; the two NRL premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said umpires allowed Storm players to &quot;wrestle&quot; his players during the Storm&#39;s controversial win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennet made a thinly veiled comment on Strorm after his side&#39;s qualifying final win over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a &quot;showcase&quot; of rugby league and saying the Queensland two weren&#39;t &quot;too big&quot; on wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players&#39; tackles, saying they focused on &quot;contact&quot; during them.
Bellamy added that the situation has boosted his confidence as his team is under fire from two head coaches, which could mean they are scared of being beaten by the Storm.
&quot;It just keeps coming -- I don&#39;t remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,&quot; Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven&#39;t changed anything from our defensive system and techniques over the last year, we&#39;ve only emphasized contact during tackles in recent weeks and that&#39;s been a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously coaches a great team, so he&#39;s probably not used to losing, which might have been a bit of a shock for him.
It&#39;s funny how things like this always come around this time of year.
Bellamy rubbished Bennet&#39;s idea of &quot;exciting football&quot;, reminding his mentor that Bennet&#39;s St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing &quot;boring&quot; football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his game on Saturday was just as exciting as ours. She was also just as exciting,&quot; Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George were criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn&#39;t really care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds disruptive, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
This is the kind of football you would want to play if you had these type of players at your disposal.
He made that point in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can&#39;t play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they are worried about the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn&#39;t even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more goals were scored in the Storm v Roosters game than the Broncos v Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I didn&#39;t watch, but what&#39;s the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more tries in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and not scoring tries the interesting thing?
I think they are agendas.
If they mention us, it means we will definitely meet again at some stage.
The Storm are off this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night&#39;s preliminary final at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possessing 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled out of Queensland has been granted $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting the co-accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovic&#39;s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he possessed the full amount and that he could have been in the cafe by accident and innocent.
High Court judge Peter Flanagan believed Maksimovic would have fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,&quot; he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he lived in the Crown case.
Maksimovic&#39;s mother and stepfather jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
&quot;Having read the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that the $200,000 bail imposed is a real financial burden on them,&quot; Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient as the accused failed to appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police daily and abide by a 6pm to 6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg used the girl&#39;s phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl&#39;s phone to obtain child abuse photos.
Stevan Hogg took the girl&#39;s phone while she was sleeping, then logged into her online chat, where he had loads of indecent photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up to find her phone missing and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found disturbing news before notifying her mother.
Police got involved and saw five photographs, then analytical computers found the address and discovered &quot;disturbing&quot; web searches using search terms for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that his motive was to &quot;lead pedophiles&quot; on the Internet before &quot;pretending to be a police officer and scare them.&quot;
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but claims he only wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He claims he jumped drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: &quot;When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw lewd images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and spoke about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of receiving or providing indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breached bail conditions on January 25 and failed to appear at a court hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders&#39; list because he can argue that there was &quot;no substantial sexual overtones&quot; in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael adjourned sentencing until October pending a report from social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in that case but was held in custody pending a hearing on the other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offender list prior to his sentencing date.
Zimbabwe&#39;s Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa&#39;s oldest leader, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but a video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and heckled during his State of the Nation address in parliament last month - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) caucus, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to obstruct Mr Mugabe&#39;s speech.
&quot;The message comes from a number that will not be displayed but is named &#39;death&#39;,&quot; he told reporters after Mr Mugabe&#39;s speech.
He cautions the members concerned to know that immunity ends in Parliament and once they step out of Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, had &quot;concerns&quot; about the threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is set to cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its effort to restructure and save costs in its business services business.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the PC and printer business from its faster-growing business hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
&quot;These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable expenses for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,&quot; said Meg Whitman, HP&#39;s CEO and chairman, who will lead the unit after the split.
&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today, and will have a broad and expansive portfolio of businesses to help businesses transition to a new way of doing business,&quot; Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parkard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and &quot;will be focused on providing unmatched integrated technology solutions&quot; to companies, according to a company statement.
It will break up the electrical equipment company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed the &quot;birthplace of Silicon Valley.&quot;
HP was undergoing a massive reorganization to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the second-largest PC maker and one of America&#39;s largest tech firms, is the latest in a sector based on the belief that a niche firm outperforms.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means Wilshere is certain to miss at least four more England games and, historically speaking, his involvement in next summer&#39;s European Championships is clearly uncertain.
The big shame of this latest issue is that Wilshere finished last season strong after an ankle injury and then returned to his former form during pre-season.
&quot;This kind of injury is not career-threatening,&quot; says Wenger.
It is a wound that needs healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn&#39;t about his ankles or the injuries he had suffered before.
That could be true from a purely medical point of view, with Wenger admitting that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
Here, too, an unpleasant pattern emerges.
Survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his playing debut six years ago.
He has only played in 65 of Arsenal&#39;s 157 league games over the past five years:
In a wider perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to miss the most days through injury.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in the injury record last season will continue.
&quot;Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get the competition,&quot; says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get away with it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I&#39;m sure it will and he has the career he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his squad.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
&quot;I try to maintain a balance and let the players who need it breathe,&quot; said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the clear favorites to advance from Group F, Zagreb&#39;s Maksimir has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo are also unbeaten in a total of 41 matches after maintaining an &quot;unbeatable&quot; campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by a magnitude 3.2 earthquake on Wednesday night.
This was the tenth time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season&#39;s Champions League defeat against Monaco and remains a distant hope of leading the club to their first European Cup win.
&quot;This commitment is tremendous,&quot; asserts Wenger.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of similar depictions in the various shows is glaring, especially given how the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever regarding suicide among young men under 15.
It was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK in 2013 and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a high enough percentage of &quot;healthy&quot; friends, their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, having a circle of mentally healthy friends is half the chance of developing mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be attainable.
In this social media communication with an emphasis on style rather than content, an immediate response is often prioritized over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have redoubled our need to appear stronger, more fun-loving, and more successful, even when in reality we are rather isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire game developer recently explained, money really can&#39;t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which shone through friendly interaction.
Joey&#39;s humor and Chandler&#39;s frequent self-sacrifice, the moments watching football on the comfy couches, Ross&#39; desire for Rachel all stem from the realization that yes, men can relate too, even if they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...&quot;my role as a listener to people who feel depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.&quot;
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with friends.
The old adage &quot;deal with it&quot; is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when trying to offer a longer term coping mechanism.
It highlights the small moments in male friendship.
As for my task, being an outsider on the phone helps people in times of desperation, but long-term support has to come from a larger circle, a network of friends and family.
So if you&#39;re heading to Comedy Central&#39;s FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk, where the interior will be completely revamped for the occasion.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know the difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG beat Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday&#39;s game as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League journey with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after making his Champions League debut and the PSG man sent the French champions to victory, but they wasted several chances before finally increasing their lead when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, so Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they aim not just to qualify for the knockout rounds, but to improve on their quarter-final run, which they have seen in each of the previous 3 editions.
But while they took the three points, it was not a classic performance from Laurent Blanc&#39;s side and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wasteful in front of goal and later substituted against his home team and the club where he began his illustrious career in 1999.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy to win away or at home in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win causes problems for our opponents and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will need to improve as the season progresses,&quot; said Blanc.
That&#39;s a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret not scoring one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to the PSG side that drew 2-2 at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentina winger has been tipped as the man to take PSG to a new level in Europe following his move from Manchester United last month, and he showed why when he latched on to Marco Verratti&#39;s pass in front of the Malmo defense and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland with a fine finish far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to set off a spectacular victory for PSG, they were bound to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage, started with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and with five defenders and two withdrawn midfielders, they were a tough opponent.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjic&#39;s shot narrowly missing the far corner of Kevin Trapp&#39;s goal in the 34th minute, they didn&#39;t offer much in attack.
Instead, PSG robbed themselves of an attacking advantage with poor passing and poor finishing, which wasn&#39;t good either from Ibrahimovic, who failed to fire five times in the first half and was then disappointed to have his shot hit the back of the net by Cavani shortly after the start of the second half.
However, he proved far more suitable when it came to creating chances for his teammates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a curling shot that ended up in Wiland&#39;s goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally arrived after an hour thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading over the line for his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic fed him a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts Malmo might have of getting something out of the game, and only a superb close-range save from Wiland dashed David Luiz&#39;s hopes and the score remained unchanged even as substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi&#39;s late goal was disallowed.
Malmo coach Age Hareide admitted at the event that PSG were a class above his side, with the Norwegian saying: &quot;Our last Champions League game was in December last year.&quot;
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a breathtaking match for them.
Glencore earned $2.5 billion in share sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by a collapse in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion from a share sale on Wednesday as part of its sweeping debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it sold about £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay down debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with tumbling commodity prices as China&#39;s economic slowdown reduces demand and ignites sparks of doom across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore shares higher on the London Stock Exchange in early morning trade on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the $2.5 billion share sale is part of wider plans to reduce its $30 billion debt, which has piled up by about a third
The company sold new shares at 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount to Tuesday&#39;s closing price.
They thus got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent for the group.
Concerns about a prolonged slowdown in China&#39;s growth cut the price of iron ore by nearly half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Xi Jinping visited Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
President Xi&#39;s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama&#39;s visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
&quot;President Xi&#39;s visit presents an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the US and China, and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the fields of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two countries,&quot; the report added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US tech leaders en route to Washington, before continuing to New York for the United Nations meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington&#39;s concerns about China&#39;s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis swept the Schengen area.
The emergency flare fired by Germany was far from uniting the European crew, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal first with the refugee problem: it would rather systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece - rather than squabble over the future distribution of refugees according to quotas based on the number that increasingly distant from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the member states changed the priority.
Rather than worrying about the final destination of the refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who arrive today and resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
&quot;Effective management of the EU&#39;s external borders is essential for managing migration,&quot; the text discussed by ministers on Monday in Brussels emphasizes.
After the single currency crisis, the EU finds itself in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but they are not losing their resolve and are increasing the pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of those seeking asylum in that country.
The Central Power thereby makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday served as proof.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering it, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.
Even a blind person can see that this is a domino effect.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris now is the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already crossed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas de Maizière discussed it intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is by no means new, but it is implemented rigidly.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of the newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory, because it fears more than others that it will not be left with camps in which refugees would accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as many as have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It&#39;s a huge gaping hole.
Athens, still in financial disarray and awaiting a new government, folded its hands in its lap.
That is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of now shared concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but has not given a number or a date.
&quot;The challenges faced by Greece apply to the whole of Europe,&quot; the EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on this front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying intervention teams of the European border control agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
&quot;It will require adequate financial resources,&quot; warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
Athens will continue to have the final say in terms of law.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting close to it.
The new emergency situation of the 2018 pushed aside the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, which was already raised at the beginning of the year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and which was strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don&#39;t even want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was retained on Monday in the text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is aborted.
The only firm promise includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, three of them reportedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the woman who was the only survivor of the affected group of eight is also of German nationality.
Previous media reports said she was a Polish woman.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious leg injury in the femur area.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly people in their forties.
&quot;The rescue operation has ended, the bodies of the victims have also been transported to Briancon for identification,&quot; explained the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department, Pierre Besnard.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the 4,015-meter Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain.
&quot;The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high,&quot; noted rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, an enormous amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3900 meters.
The Meteorological Service did not warn of bad weather in the area today.
Trpišovský before the match with Braga: Finally the real Europe.
During his cup debut, coach Jindřich Trpišovský managed to get through the preliminary rounds of the Europa League to the base group with the Liberec footballers, and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome Braga, the finalist from 2011, at the beginning of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, he wants to impose his style of play on them.
After all the nerves in the knockout stages, where every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we&#39;re there and we&#39;re going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don&#39;t have to be afraid of every conceded goal, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by just two matches.
&quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to it and it&#39;s real Europe, before it was only a qualification,&quot; said Trpišovský at the press conference.
He considers Braga to be a top team.
He will be very active, they have only Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent will probably be more difficult because he doesn&#39;t have such a name, but at the same time he has a player in his squad who I suspect scored three goals for Manchester.
&quot;It is an excellent team at the level of top teams,&quot; stated Trpišovský.
However, he does not consider Braga to be a clear favorite.
I take it that we are playing at home, so we are certainly not outsiders.
&quot;I think that we showed in the home competition and in the preliminaries that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that,&quot; said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen out of eleven duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can also impose its style on Braz.
We are expecting a team that will be strong on the ball, and at the same time, it is uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 formation with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
&quot;It is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players perform on the field,&quot; Trpišovský said.
In the preliminaries, we studied our opponents a lot, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which is what we adapted our training sessions to.
&quot;And we definitely want, even if it will be very challenging, to play according to our notes,&quot; added the coach.
Student films will dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
This year, over 350 authors from 51 countries submitted their works to the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which the committee consisting of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be screened from October 15 to 18 at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said Jakub Charvát, the festival&#39;s spokesperson.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival&#39;s jingle.
This year it&#39;s a detective story.
The director of this year&#39;s festive evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theater work.
&quot;And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year,&quot; said Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student creations - feature films, animations and documentaries.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which includes, for example, last year&#39;s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the organizers of the festival prepare an accompanying program.
The Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, the turbo chanson group Poletíme?, the playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Life at a Bar, will arrive.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by Jana Ašenbrennerová, a graduate of the Písek film school and holder of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will show the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Cameraman and documentarian Martin Čech will come to talk with the visitors, Gerhard Gruber will accompany the silent film The Cameraman with his music, and natives of Písek Brukner, Novotný and Hlach will christen their new book 3 friends from P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy that will live on.
&quot;Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common ties and filmmaking,&quot; said the spokesperson.
The Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, take several job auditions at the same time and thus get a job, will certainly help with this.
The festival is connected with the establishment of the Private Higher Vocational Film School in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth grade.
In the event of bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies have to pay the clients&#39; claims in full.
Insurance companies should cover client claims in full in the event of travel agency bankruptcy.
The House of Representatives decided on this on Wednesday, when it approved a revised amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Doing Business in the Tourism Industry.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to the draft that is headed for consideration by the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay clients&#39; claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry for Regional Development insists on the amendment, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies against bankruptcy if the amendment goes into effect.
However, travel agencies also criticize the proposal.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Euro-compliant.
She drew attention to this year&#39;s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, emphasized Šlechtová.
&quot;We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it is feasible,&quot; countered TOP 09 vice-chairman Miroslav Kalousek.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
&quot;Travel agencies will have to close their operations or move them abroad,&quot; warned Kalousek.
Tomio Okamura (SPD), member of the presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies, disagreed with Kalousk&#39;s concerns based on a survey of Central Committee members.
&quot;Stop showing us lobbying insurance companies,&quot; he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of the insurance companies to be relevant, according to him, there is no official written statement from them in this sense.
However, they are reportedly investigating whether the travel agencies will pay a co-payment, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the position of the competing Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the cleaning of the stairs by Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
&quot;Consumer protection works,&quot; says Fischerová.
Her proposal to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Even Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not go ahead with the proposal to return the draft to the committee due to the alleged contradiction with the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to travel agencies that, according to him, can threaten consumers.
The rapporteur of the bill, Martina Berdychová (ANO), has withdrawn her proposal, which would have limited the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that the insurance payment would not cover the entire risk, due to the verdict of the Constitutional Court.
The amendment will not include the originally proposed minimum four million insurance limit for travel agencies that offer air travel, and the million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of the planned revenue from tour sales.
However, the insurance indemnity limit will have to be such that it covers all customer claims in the event of the travel agency&#39;s bankruptcy.
Even after the amendments, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to indicate which travel agency organizes the tour for the tours they sell.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies before concluding a contract, among other things, data on finances and the number of trips.
The approved amendment proposal of the Committee for Public Administration also provides for further regular informing of insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with data on the number of passengers and sold tours, the total price of sold tours and the amount of advance payments and sales for tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of its legal obligations towards the insurance company, it will, according to the draft, call on it to make corrections or it will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts in the event that a breach of duty could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to adjust the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry for Regional Development will determine the amount of subsidy to the mountain service based on its application, which will be submitted by the end of April for the following year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the past year, a financial plan for spending and an outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the proponent of the law did not understand the situation, what will happen if the insurance company terminates the CK contract.
She will not be allowed to organize tours, and clients who bought the tour before the cancellation of the insurance will lose it, according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its economy was in good condition.
One of the ways travel agencies can cope with such a situation is to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad, and then we will only act as agencies in our market, said the vice-chairman of the association, Jan Papež.
According to him, the draft amendment also includes the institution of a bank guarantee, but it is so ill-thought-out that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot be for an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, changing the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
In two years&#39; time, due to the new EU directive, the entire law will have to be revised again.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are now operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CCs ended their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth roughly twenty billion CZK per year.
Merkel: We must improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must advocate for the improvement of humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees to Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting with German state premiers.
At the same time, she again appealed for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the member countries of the twenty-eight.
We must do more to help the countries from which refugees leave, or in which they stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will advocate for decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, according to whom such a signal could also be higher financial aid or closer cooperation of the EU with international humanitarian organizations.
&quot;The federal states also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis among European countries,&quot; Merkel said.
The Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference in this context that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out in favor of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities so that they can start integrating foreigners more quickly, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees should be used for the integration of those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed for refugees to master German.
It is a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can become an asset for us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, claiming it wasn&#39;t necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday&#39;s episode of HBO&#39;s Project Greenlight, the cast member interrupted Brown as she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives regarding black protagonists in the script.
&quot;When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting the movie, not by casting the show,&quot; Damon asserts.
Shocked, Brown reacted with disbelief, sighing &quot;Hoo! Wow. Okay,&quot; when the Martian comments hit the airwaves.
Damon and Brown were joined by co-producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show&#39;s finalists.
&quot;I would like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they are going to treat the character of Harmony,&quot; Brown said early on.
The only black character who is a hooker who is bagged by a white pimp.
The Dear White People producer was pushing finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their direction &quot;could end up giving us something we don&#39;t want.&quot;
After the debate aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon&#39;s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed outrage at the clip&#39;s writing, &quot;Matt Damon was talking to the only black woman in the room so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE it hurts.&quot;
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon&#39;s comment comes at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national traction, pressuring lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made allusions to the movement while introducing the Album of the Year nominees during the Grammy Awards.
&quot;Albums are still important,&quot; he said.
Much like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Most recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
&quot;The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love,&quot; the leaders declared.
Damon was recently reported to be on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not clear whether he accepted the invitation or whether he had already met the Pope.
&quot;American Ninja Warrior Has Its First Winner&quot;
Professional rock climber and rock climber Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, taking home $1 million.
In the competition, which has just finished its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to clear all the obstacles on the course.
During this season&#39;s finale, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to complete the climb within the time limit, becoming the first American Ninja Warrior competitor to clear the grueling stage 4, but Caldiero beat him by a full three seconds to win the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to the news E! News right after his hard-fought win, and it was clear he was still reeling from winning the $1 million grand prize.
&quot;It feels amazing, I&#39;ve never made more than $10,000 a year in my life,&quot; Isaac told E! in response to his win.
&quot;So all of a sudden... I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s going to be like now.&quot;
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about how the finale went and why Britten would not receive any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the course the fastest.
&quot;If there are multiple competitors on the course, the one with the best time wins,&quot; Weed said.
Although winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
&quot;I don&#39;t think he holds a grudge.
He is happy that he was able to achieve what he did.
He received a warm reception from the fans.
He is a great guy and he loves his family.
He is a hero to his children and wife.&quot;
Geoff told me, &quot;If there was anyone who could beat me, I&#39;m glad it was Isaac.&quot;
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with an eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers narrowly edged out the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn&#39;t exactly been a walk in the park for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, one of baseball&#39;s best teams, are in last place in the American League Central right now.
The Tigers narrowly avoided defeat with a close 5-4 win over Minnesota at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins missed a chance to close in on the Houston Astros and grab the second wild card in the American League.
If only for one night, it was a return to the Z word for Detroit that has been so elusive for them throughout the second half of the season.
&quot;It&#39;s always fun to win, no matter what,&quot; Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings before tacking on another in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) allowed 6 1/3 hits and 3 runs.
It was only his third successful game in the last nine games.
&quot;I want to finish this year with convincing results,&quot; said Simon.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get into the game when you&#39;re often on the bench and that&#39;s why I want to really get into the game.&quot;
Tigers shortstop Victor Martinez had three hits and two walks and his first shutout since mid-August.
It was Martinez&#39;s first three-point game since the last game in June, when he hit four in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
&quot;He leaned into it pretty well,&quot; Ausmus said.
&quot;He looked good in training, batted noticeably better and managed to carry that over into the match.&quot;
Three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning gave the Twins their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton won the inning with a double to left field.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored a run on a pitch and Simon struck out Brian Dozier before being replaced by lefty Blaine Hardy.
Hardy struck out his only batter, Mauer, and faced pinch hitter Miguel Sano, who hit a fly ball that went around two bases, leaving right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two runners on base and a chance to tie the game in the second inning, VerHagen was able to send the third baseman over two bases.
Plouffe has already scored 27 runs across two goals this season and reigns in the league table.
Detroit held on for the ninth inning, with Mauer getting two runs scored and Bruce Rondon making it 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, the right-hander dismissed San in three overs.
Detroit took advantage and scored points on the play of Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the retired right-hander, who returned after more than a month out with back strain.
&quot;I definitely didn&#39;t expect that start,&quot; Hughes said, &quot;but by the third inning I felt like I was pitching better.&quot;
After withstanding a first-inning onslaught, Hughes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Two outs for right fielder JD Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who walked around the bases in the first.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-21 streak.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right field to score the next run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out as he tried to run to third base.
The Tigers added a run in the second inning as pitcher James McCann and shortstop Anthony Gose each scored two runs to make it 3-0.
&quot;That brought us to our knees,&quot; Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
&quot;He didn&#39;t hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place.&quot;
Hughes, who won by pitch, went scoreless in the third inning and was replaced by right-hander AJ Achter.
Hughes walked three, walked six batters and struck out four.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez left the game with right shoulder soreness.
Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez&#39;s shoulder in 2007, will take care of him.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, is expected to start Wednesday&#39;s game.
Sanchez will be replaced by lefty Daniel Norris, who will return from injury to start against the Twins.
Since being traded for lefty David Price on June 30, Norris is 1-1 in 4 games.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to a pulled muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Opposing Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will be Minnesota lefty Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with governance reform on Tuesday.
&quot;China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies,&quot; he said regarding the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting opening-up in nascent reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and also provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group adopted a series of directives, including the negative list of regulatory market access, the relaxation of border control policies, the support of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the registration residency system.
The statement said a negative list would be drawn up to identify sectors and businesses that are off limits for investment.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
The move is significant as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to firms and ensure that firms themselves decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled industry, more areas will be opened up to private investment.
&quot;The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,&quot; the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a &quot;green card,&quot; thanks to the optimization of requirements and the simplification of the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and developing professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and senior officials Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New wards may be created in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to the deputy governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the inpatient departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient, and partial adjustments should be made based on an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, one-day surgery centers could be established in surgical departments, where procedures in surgical fields that do not require hospitalization longer than 24 hours would be performed according to the set concept.
In which specific hospitals there should be workplaces focused on one-day surgery, it is not yet clear.
A laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases could be created at the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital.
The concept also recommended the establishment of an apallic center that would care for patients with cerebral palsy who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesia-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such equipment in Ostrov Hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region are follow-up care beds, especially Léčeben beds for long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely related to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, follow-up care beds are mainly missing in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
Abandoned buildings after centralization could be used there.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there are no social health beds focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.
There is a shortage of these beds in the entire country, so it could also serve as a so-called Alzheimer&#39;s center for other regions.
According to the recommendation, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which funds from European subsidies will be released.
&quot;These are beds that will follow the fields of superspecialized care and will create a space for transferring patients after surgery, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedures,&quot; describes the regional concept of inpatient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
