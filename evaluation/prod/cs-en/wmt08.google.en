Inflation in Europe jumped due to food
The accelerating inflation measured in the Eurozone is mainly caused by the constant rise in food prices.
November price growth in the 13 countries of the eurozone was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation was registered at 3.1 percent, the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union announced.
The official forecast predicted only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian banks of issue, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the key interest rate, saying that the cut, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below two percent, but close to it.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to &quot;dissuade&quot; inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent represents a fifteen-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the Eurozone has soared due to soaring food and energy prices.
Futures prices for wheat rose by 88 percent, and the soybean exchange rate also reached its highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has risen by 52 percent this year, and last month one barrel of black gold already cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from this year&#39;s 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation will remain around 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement increased significantly after a long period of stagnation at the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured such a low - 13 percent support.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to one-fifth of MSZP&#39;s support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support among the entire population is two percent.
Among certain voters of the party, there are one percent more supporters of both camps.
The public&#39;s opinion of the economy has worsened even from the previous low - the proportion of those who consider the country&#39;s economic situation to be downright very bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while another 46 percent say the situation is quite bad.
Families evaluate the change in their material situation after more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, now again more pessimistically.
As for next year, a larger part of the population expects a further deterioration and only a tenth an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, which is the most of all Gallup Institute polls to date, thought that the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or very trusted by 13 percent of those polled, while Viktor Orbán&#39;s share of supporters is 38 percent.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all, 27 percent the leader of the Fidesz movement.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While after last October&#39;s riots, 35 percent considered the government and the prime minister to remain in place as desirable, currently this share is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) see the solution only in calling new elections.
It is significant for the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of the respondents answered the question regarding their possible participation that they would definitely take part in the referendum and another 20 percent said that they would probably take part.
By comparison, only 55 percent would definitely participate in &quot;parliamentary elections held this Sunday&quot; and another 15 percent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be undoubted based on current intentions.
74 percent would say no to school fees, 79 percent to doctor&#39;s fees, and 84 percent to hospital fees.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who definitely promise to participate, then the introduction of school fees, doctor&#39;s fees and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent, respectively.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth more expensive than Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle maintained last year&#39;s average 16 percent increase in price levels, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Napi Gazdaság newspaper article
The usual Christmas shopping basket of Napi Gazdaság newspaper in the Budaörs business triangle increased by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price increased by well over a thousand forints.
Since the prices in supermarkets &quot;soared&quot; already last December, in percentage terms, due to the previously high basis, the price increase was not so drastic.
However, it is certainly unhappy for consumers that what they could easily buy last year for less than nine thousand forints, now they cannot even buy it for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of Daily Economy in the examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003, the consumption basket cost HUF 6,800.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year&#39;s level, but the price of wild breasts, nuts and also poppy seeds increased significantly.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca Cola in a returnable bottle was under 200 forints, so even with the deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, according to the consumption basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság, Auchan was the most expensive this year, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices appearing in the consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság increased by 15 percent compared to the prices last year at Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
When comparing last year&#39;s highest and this year&#39;s lowest value of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year&#39;s lowest and this year&#39;s highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was 1,480 on average.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with the fact that last Christmas the prices were affected by the increase in VAT.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the department stores were obviously unable to decide how big a price range they should set for individual products, as they were unable to predict what effect the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If the merchant plans the circulation speed of a given product incorrectly, he can lose a significant profit due to the price spread adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Last year, due to VAT, the increase in the price of the Napi Gazdaság newspaper&#39;s consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was HUF 1,720 higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest was HUF 844.
This year, the extreme difference did not manifest itself, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest also went up by 1,284 forints.
A comparison of the two Christmas seasons revealed a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months the price of daily consumption goods in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(Among other things, this does not absolutely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase of more than 30 percent in the case of several basic foods within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, also in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumption basket of the Daily Economy, it seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, already quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of barely more than 10 percent compared to the base even in the worst case.
Flour suppliers seem to occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they managed to impose a drastic price increase even in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business golden triangle are not complaining, they are still reporting a good year.
In our experience, the majority of customers in the three stores we visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything in bulk, they take non-perishable food after their salaries.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets had long queues at checkouts, or a sharp increase in the number of visitors.
However, as we know, turnover is lower in the countryside, several international chains complain to research companies that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also of durable consumer goods.
Many places save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals, mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overworked staff do not help stop the spread of the disease, claims the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
Many places also save on disinfectants.
A MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John&#39;s Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who was hospitalized after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same location earlier this year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was discharged home, but not long after that he had to return with an MRSA infection, and due to the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
Until December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multiresistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröczová, head of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that as many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been registered with certainty in hospitals, others are unknown.
Almost two-thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without causing illness.
Infections caused by SA (eg strep throat, tonsillitis, skin infection, morning sickness) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are given excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and that spread rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Above all, in the case of temporary or permanent poor functioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in elderly patients, it can cause serious hospital infections, for example morning sickness or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John&#39;s Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
&quot;An infection must not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not only there,&quot; said Tibor Nyulasi, &quot;where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.&quot;
Resistant to antibiotics
&quot;We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treat them with rubber gloves and we have the necessary antibiotics in the mask and for their treatment,&quot; said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but even then, infection cannot always be avoided.
Taking a sample is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favorable for the prevention of the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, claims Karolina Böröczová.
As this infection occurs significantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen incoming patients and immediately isolate MRSA carriers.
However, the collection of microbiological samples is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations also plays a role in this.
The majority of cases are thus detected if the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment with antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent the emergence of resistance to drugs, but even hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even rarer in the case of basic or outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina Böröczová.
It saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads between patients most often through medical personnel.
That is why hand washing and the use of gloves and a mask play a very important role, but even in this there are serious deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and by touch, but in the conditions of domestic hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately we can also encounter the fact that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, which increases the chance of infections.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, there are demonstrably fewer similar infections or the further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its incidence.
The program appears to be a success, with MRSA infections in England showing a downward trend, according to published data.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) places the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant disease agents (which also includes MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these disease agents among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
Official expert opinion in the case of police captain XXII. circuit that caused the fatal accident is complete.
It can be ruled out that police captain XXII. of the district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his position, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, informed the spokesperson of the High Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday after the expert opinion of this case was completed.
An expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then director of the police directorate XXII. of the district crashed on Tuesday in Lajose Kossutha Street at XXII. perimeter with his own car while turning a fifty-five-year-old man who stepped in front of him while crossing the road outside the marked crosswalk.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian was crossing the zebra crossing is not a mitigating circumstance according to road traffic rules, the turning car must still give way.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Because of these events, the district police chief resigned and asked to be transferred to retirement, according to a police statement, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor&#39;s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks with a total value of 400 million euros to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework worth EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of projects in the field of transport and the environment, implemented with the support of the Cohesion Fund, while the parties had previously concluded a loan agreement for the amount of EUR 100 million, the agreement has now been signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement worth 150 million euros is also used for budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of 300 million euros for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining 150 million euros may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract for 50 million euros, which the budget will use mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The 4th metro route was also discussed at the meeting.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the metro&#39;s financing, they will return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this may happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary with an amount of 8.4 billion euros.
The interest on loans that the EIB provides with an eight-year waiting period and without commitment commission is tied to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astounding - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys on the ever-cheapest, but rapidly increasing, EU market?
Analysis of Re/Max&#39;s Bulgarian division.
Bulgaria, with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses, is undoubtedly the most sought-after Eastern European property buying destination right now.
Among the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient towns of Sozobol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from the Re/Max Bulgaria company, sooner or later the central part of the country will attract the interest of investors as well - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are also buying in the vicinity of the downright cheap city of Ruse.
The capital city of Sofia also promises attractive possibilities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming a sought-after travel destination in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foresight investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but there are also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present here, and there are traditionally many Russian customers by the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, proximity to a big city, shops and usually a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is the buyers of cottages (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of an increase in value in the medium or long term.
The increase in real estate prices in the capital is continuous, or the demand is getting stronger.
Real estate prices in Bulgaria are the lowest in the European Union, but they have grown by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
Rising property prices far outpace wage growth.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to information from the Minister of the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, the meetings of experts will be completed on Tuesday, and after the official opening on Wednesday, the international conference on the post-2012 climate regime will continue with ministerial meetings.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses the efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol valid until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to discuss exact numbers now, although it is leaning toward an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 relative to 1990 levels.
Another big question of the conference is whether developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also provide both material and technological aid to countries that depend on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, most likely within the framework of the World Environmental Protection Program (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the Piac és Profit magazine.
Hungarian six percent
The Minister of the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU&#39;s efforts to maintain a leading role in efforts to protect the global climate and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of a &quot;post-2012 deal&quot; and is ready to commit to up to a 30 percent reduction if others developed regions of the world, respectively developed countries willing to accept responsibility and obligations corresponding to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set a reduction target of 5.2 percent, with the then 15 EU member states committing to 8 percent.
Hungary&#39;s commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill. – is mentioned in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
A lot is at stake in Bali, or an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would definitely be postponed until 2012. In that case, the reduction commitments established by the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new a system of reducing emissions, the necessity of which was also pointed out in its latest report by the UN international scientific body dealing with climate change - IPCC, which is the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the Earth&#39;s average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which the scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units are posting footage of their actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing site to promote themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) took a liking to YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban here since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The footage, captured by a miniature helmet-mounted camera, is reviewed by the Air Force Command, which controls combat operations in the Kandahar region, and then forwarded to London, where it is uploaded to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
In this way, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already reached the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have watched their &quot;channel&quot;.
The UK Ministry of Defense registered as &quot;defenceheadquarters&quot; in spring 2007 and publishes footage from both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the UK Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force released the videos as originally intended for recruiting purposes, and the Defense Department says they are also good for informing the general public about the true purpose of the military&#39;s presence abroad.
&quot;Promotion published in this form costs next to nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads,&quot; defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, &quot;but it also necessarily carries a certain political message, or in a special way confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.&quot;
The Americans made a play
The army is worried that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also being uploaded to the server, depicting, for example, the death of soldiers: in somewhat hypocritical, &quot;official&quot; promotional films, the officers only talk about losses, but the bloody image of the battle is not shown.
After all, many videos from the battles in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, have already reached the Internet, but the British army found them only now.
The Americans do recruitment a little differently - with a free-to-download shooter game called America&#39;s Army, in which the player can step directly into the soldiers&#39; shoes through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have Christmas with a raffle and cookies
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will organize a final work meeting for her colleagues, where they will say goodbye to 2007 with scones and coffee.
In some ministries, there will be a celebration with live music, in other ministries, they will conjure up a Christmas atmosphere for officials with a raffle and a toast.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - this is how the powerful have fun.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defense will organize the most expensive ministerial Christmas party this year, but its employees are not expecting it.
On Orphan Christmas, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, on Mission Christmas they will treat family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort donates 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are outdone by other departments.
The GKM party is organized in the center of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints, and approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred employees of the Ministry.
At its celebration, the resort will stick to Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and there will also be a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the building of the State Council of Justice (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost one million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
It seems that one department of the NFÜ is invited to yet another Christmas party: this one will be organized by the company that ensures the course of tenders, the Hungarian Center for Economic Development (MAG), with EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the Vígszínház theater building.
MAG as did not confirm this information, as we were unable to reach the relevant person.
No need for a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas organized a ball of St. Lucy.
However, OIT did not want money from him for the use of its halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the greeting of the minister, after dinner it was possible to dance to the accompaniment of live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo], evening dresses or suits were not mandatory at the ball.
The Puritan party is being organized by the departments of health, labor and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for HUF 400,000 in its own building.
The Minister of Labor, Mónika Lamperthová, does not even officially invite her colleagues to the Christmas party, but to the final work meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will only receive coffee and pastries, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister for Local Self-Government, Gordon Bajnai, will simply have a drink with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry for Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, where it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party, he donates HUF 2,500 per guest - the total amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Ever since János Veres has been minister, PM workers have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality is intensified not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Resort is holding a New Year&#39;s reception on January 20, the ministerial Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will take place in the Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the City Gardens, and according to the Ministry&#39;s statement, 1,000 forints per person is intended for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting from the minister and end with refreshments.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the respective press departments told the [origo] portal.
They could not tell the price of the Christmas celebrations of the Department of the Environment in the press department.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
A giant strike is coming
The Liga trade union association, or the National Union of Workers&#39; Councils (MOSZ), will create its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday&#39;s indefinite strike.
A protest public meeting is being held on Saturday, and work will be stopped on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action is sure to cause serious traffic disruptions, as rail traffic will almost completely stop, and Budapest Transport Company (BKV) employees will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga association together with the National Union of Workers&#39; Councils will present the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike committee LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday&#39;s action.
A protest public meeting is being held on Saturday, and from Monday the unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no date has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If Parliament ultimately fails to pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw their strike call.
However, if the legislation is voted down, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the next course of action.
According to the agenda of the Parliament meeting on Monday, it is also possible that the health insurance law will only be voted on in the late evening or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, it is possible to count on serious interruptions of transport: work on the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period, part of Budapest&#39;s public transport and more than half of Volán companies may stop in the morning.
At the same time, half of the road will be closed in many parts of the country.
The strike call was joined by numerous trade unions and civic organizations, the list of which is constantly updated on the website of the Liga association.
Some organizations announced an indefinite strike, others announced a temporary work stoppage.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, while more and more people are traveling by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the announcements so far, there will be a strike at BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at the Budapest Airport company. teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Doctors Union will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Trade Union Cooperation Forum (SZEF), is organizing a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the Liga association is that the government withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and present a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of counting pensioners valid from next year be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system before the year 2010 for early retirement for the relevant fields of work.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), which falls under the trade union Liga, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding the railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the country&#39;s risk
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of the Political Capital Institute, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August of this year, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several ways.
In the &quot;risk warning&quot; drawn up by the company, it is written: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is that &quot;by intensifying the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, even violent ethnic clashes may occur in a short period of time&quot;.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard&#39;s political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an action, the research institute adds.
As he writes, all of this can be explained by one of the greatest carelessness of Hungarian political representatives: &quot;the representatives of public life left the public discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict.&quot;
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the institute judges.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, due to the great attention of the domestic and foreign media, &quot;to a large extent spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity&quot;.
The institute reminds: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which has been receiving more and more publicity and vehemence since the fall of 2006, is that several organizations have been created in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which call themselves &quot;national militia&quot; associations.
&quot;The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, attacks on the homeland, disruption of order), in addition pointing out the inability of the police, the army , or the state,&quot; he adds.
He further notes: all this is done in a way that tries to wrap all sorts of political efforts based on society&#39;s opposition to politics and parties in civilian clothes.
Emphasizing civility and the form of association in the case of these groupings is therefore not only used to avoid the legal pitfalls of court registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor increasing the risk also from the point of view of neighborly relations.
&quot;In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed to in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, the ultra-nationalist political representatives of some neighboring countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the area,&quot; he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, the creation of which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the creation of the Bulgarian Guard is the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia&#39;s districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish the Guard, stating that the organization&#39;s goal was &quot;national militia&quot;.
According to her, in the past 17 years, there has been &quot;gypsy terror&quot; in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, reminds the Institute Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a stormy discussion among the Bulgarian public.
As he goes on to write, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is signaled by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will form their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
When asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, stated: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they release a risk analysis every year and if they find something that could affect a change in risk, they inform the public, like in this case by issuing a risk alert.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, days off are strictly defined by law, and it has already become common practice to move working days around holidays, which we expect less often next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the European Union or America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and non-working days.
Days off are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year here: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is a holiday - on New Year&#39;s Day so that people can relax after New Year&#39;s Eve.
We otherwise have a total of eleven free holidays during the year.
National holidays are March 15, celebrating the 1848 revolution, and October 23, commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1 we celebrate work, on November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day holidays.
As our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to shift the working day in cases where we only work one day before or after a holiday.
However, the price for long weekends is that we stay at work and school on the preceding Saturdays.
For many years, the Minister of Labor has regulated when we work on the day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday in a special decree.
The legal regulation applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public employees and to persons in public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, in view of their purpose, also operate on non-working days.
This year, the work schedule will change only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, or according to experience so far, most people will &quot;work&quot; the days between Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve in advance or use the saved vacation in this way.
Next year, several of our holidays will fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer working day shifts than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be transformed around Labor Day, so that workers can then stay at home for four days at leisure.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, can be a day of rest.
Another shift is related to the holiday of October 23: work will be done on Saturday, October 18 instead of Friday, October 24.
However, the end of the year next year will be able to take place completely under the sign of holidays, because from December 24 almost everywhere will have non-stop holidays, despite the fact that New Year&#39;s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six creepy little things you can do to annoy your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost don&#39;t even notice anymore: all of this &quot;enriches&quot; everyday days in the workplace.
The question is, will you get used to these minor inconveniences, or will you put on your gloves and deliberately avoid unclear situations that can make others angry.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you in the marketing department,” a colleague informs you.
That you missed the meeting because of it?
At best, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to deliver the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is resolved with one apology.
Before making an awkward apology, it&#39;s a good idea to think about what you could do to make your colleagues uncomfortable, and consciously try to prevent it.
Borrowing something that isn&#39;t yours?
There&#39;s nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, an office item or your phone and it&#39;s not there.
Remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but it&#39;s gone by morning?
Or have you discovered your pen that you thought was lost on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Don&#39;t take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will rightly be angry with you for digging into their things.
Don&#39;t take envelopes or sticky notes with you from the office, as it can be inconvenient if you run out of them prematurely and you need them immediately.
Gossip about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the spread of gossip.
Who, with whom, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don&#39;t hang your news (assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues on everyone&#39;s nose!
When one of them shares their innermost secrets with you, don&#39;t abuse their trust!
Lock up what you have heard and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even when others know about his things.
Do you report your absence without reason?
If you call the office and cite a severe headache to report your absence because you are not feeling well, or you think you would rather rest today, remember that your work, urgent tasks and work with a certain deadline are for you someone else will have to do it.
Be considerate of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not be going to work the next day, or that something may happen that will require you to stay home, let your colleagues and supervisors know that you will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Humming, giggling, talking on the phone
Have you immersed yourself in work, only to be rudely pulled out of it by the giggles of your colleagues?
Have you accidentally overheard a phone conversation you&#39;d rather not hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by humming, singing, talking loudly (over their heads), or stomping, cursing constantly, or loudly expressing your displeasure.
All this can be distracting even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If something is not on time or you forgot to send an important letter or message, don&#39;t blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to possible chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you could make things right, fix the sloppiness!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Sweatpants and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not suitable for the office!
Don&#39;t wear casual clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Don&#39;t be sloppy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in casual clothes - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to please, he ceases to be interesting
Driving around in the usual morning congestion.
A strange melody comes from the radio: the sound of a violin joined by electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
The music changes tempo and bass is added with the previous tonal timbre, then a female choir joins in as a real gem.
On station mr2, a song by Zagar called Wings of Love is playing.
Domestic music life has not spoiled us with quality electronic pop for a long time.
But suddenly the constipation looks quite different because you&#39;re listening to Zagar&#39;s new album.
The emergence of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture, and although garage rock with its guitar thrashing is back in vogue, even domestic electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pětikostelí and he also played in Yonderboi&#39;s band, until in the end - perhaps because two pipers cannot fit in one band - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he only started to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török&#39;s film &quot;Szezon&quot;).
Playing in smaller clubs in the early days, his band became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine listed their 2002 debut album as one of the fifty most important house records and declared Zagar and Yonderboie to be about the only house trendsetters who could sell and on the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly &quot;on course&quot;, although of course no one asked them if they were happy with this label.
The band responded as they should: they made a new, better album.
The now released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new paths for them, although the title itself tries to create a connection with the early flights in Pěticostelí.
This is one verse from the composition of Balázs Zságer&#39;s old band there.
The reference to the ethereal, flying would have been appropriate, but next to the ethereal touch of this music, now - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll appeared.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the album in Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, which recently plays popular music from morning to night, the sweeping melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with six local female singers (&quot;Underground Divas&quot;), began to stick.
So everything is fine (?).
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, to what extent does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of fringe music doesn&#39;t mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don&#39;t say anything, and it can also be created just for the sake of sales, which makes it commercial.
But even a good pop song can stem from an honest inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude, as it is received, works independently of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially to the west of us, light music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers and people in their twenties go to concerts there, but also older people.
They follow much more the transformations of light music happening around them, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who listens to your music, where and in what numbers?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
With us, music is not born with a goal, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more at concerts, where mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the imperceptible changes of the moment.
However, I have noticed that when a person wants to please an audience, from that moment on he ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow Yonderboi&#39;s example?
He works solo and built his career further west than us.
B. Zs.: We don&#39;t actually follow his path, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music that way.
We are more of a team player, relying on each other&#39;s musical presence and letting it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work would be compared to Yonderboi&#39;s compositions, always a few of us would break away from his band and go our separate ways.
hvg.hu: In the mr2 Petőfi chart, the song Wings of Love reached the first place.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
With a more popular style, did you consciously open yourself up to a wider audience?
B.Zs.: We didn&#39;t plan to write a hit that would sell the album.
There&#39;s more to that song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, with which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six female singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir of female soloists of the domestic music scene with good voices.
That&#39;s how this six-member choir came together - that is, Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls transform it into something?
B.Zs.: The composition had existed for a long time in an instrumental version, when the material for the record was gathered, we thought that something else was needed for this composition.
The sequence of chords beckoned to be joined by a vocal part.
That very night, I sang a tune to it, which the girls later learned.
It all came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember it being livened up by that, but of course the Divas were needed for that.
It wouldn&#39;t work that energetically with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and in the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don&#39;t have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don&#39;t have their own part, they sing completely together and they&#39;re not louder than the music, so the music doesn&#39;t just accompany their singing.
They also stood at the back of the stage.
Is that on purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were behind was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn&#39;t want to divide solo roles is on the contrary intentional.
That song is also about forgetting our ego a little, where we are from, where we belong, and just letting ourselves be lifted up by those wings, the wings of love.
I wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you work with the most?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the music, not even once, the heavier pieces occurred more during the mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray&#39;s Dilemma, in which I play the concert grand piano, or Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn&#39;t want to work for a long time, then everything slowly found its place, like a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That keeps changing with concerts and the fact that I already &quot;released&quot; the record.
Now it&#39;s Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions on inferiority
Treacherous fraudster.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka, describes its fun-loving employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of him, she lost almost five billion euros.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market early.
&quot;He is mentally weaker,&quot; came from the mouth of his superiors, who sent the police on him.
But as it follows from Kerviel&#39;s statement, which was reported by the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who at the end of last year had profits of 1.6 billion euros from his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
&quot;All I wanted was to make money for my bank,&quot; he claims in the deposition.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
He sensed the opportunity already at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, made to low-income clients or those with a history of repayment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis was not supposed to have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn&#39;t believe it and bet correctly.
At the end of the year, its profit rose to 1.6 billion euros.
&quot;Even when I made the first half a billion, I didn&#39;t know how to announce it,&quot; admits Kerviel, adding that he certainly didn&#39;t keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that he would not be found out.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even when the Eurex exchange became interested in his deals.
Risk was gain
Was he afraid he would be found out?
Not really.
“I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to gradually work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
&quot;Already during my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
For my education and also for professional and personal development,&quot; Kerviel described to investigators.
But shortly after joining came the first big success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he made a profit, because he bet on the decline of this title during the bomb attacks on London half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger - he wanted more.
As long as you&#39;re making money, we&#39;ll let you
&quot;It&#39;s like a snowball,&quot; he told officers.
But the bosses allegedly knew, or rather suspected, everything.
“As long as I was making money, they turned a blind eye.
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to clear it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
&quot;I have only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn&#39;t have a vacation is a broker who doesn&#39;t want anyone looking at his records,&quot; Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programs, from which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programs to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport program is the largest operational program and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage the sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain funds for innovative business.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries in drawing money from EU funds.
The court upheld the 20-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua
The appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the twenty-year sentence for the country&#39;s former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will go back behind bars, it is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to prison officials whether they will let Alemán serve his sentence at home, or whether he will go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Alemán established to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for this year passed last year with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies quietly approved this traditionally overlooked, although most influential, law.
It is a certain paradox.
All governance begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
It is more media-friendly and therefore receives much more attention in the media.
The guesswork of politicians is much more interesting to the public than stark numbers.
State budgets in previous social democratic governments suffered from three ailments, which the one in 2008 is unable to solve at once:
The first of them is the high share of legally required, so-called mandatory expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent &quot;coalition&quot; of the ČSSD and KSČM last year before the elections.
The second of them is deficit management as a consequence of the illness of the first.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
However, the budget deficit of cities and municipalities is a ticking time bomb.
Many mayors, in order to obtain additional resources for investments, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, often recklessly issued bonds, with which they disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In past years, they managed to pay off these debts by mass selling shares in energy and other distribution networks, which they received from the state through privatization.
Now they no longer have this resource.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for several years, which the ČSSD constantly boasts about.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put their public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state was increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed their economy much more sensibly than our republic.
It is a huge shame that falls mainly on the past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have swelled to gigantic proportions in recent years.
Even if part of the senseless populist spending, approved this year before the elections, has been canceled, if the retirement limit and pension reform are not moved in the near future, then virtually any politics in this country will end, and whoever is in power will be merely incumbency.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money for pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year&#39;s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the displacement of normal spending by mandatory spending.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for the year 2008 would be completely useless if the previous governments had not managed as much as they could in the last ten years.
If we don&#39;t really want the governing politicians to become mere officials, then we have to be patient and let this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it gets in taxes and fees, calm for the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejci
Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Thus, more than one hundred billion dollars will reach the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks bid on the interest rate at which they are willing to lend money.
For example, the US Fed will send forty billion dollars to the auction, and then make another twenty-four billion available to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the central banks of individual countries have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
&quot;This move is intended to address the economy&#39;s biggest problem, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,&quot; Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consultancy wrote in his report to clients.
&quot;Coordinated action by central banks reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,&quot; Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars due to defaulted loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses of billions.
&quot;Central banks must be really scared of what may come next when they decide to take this course,&quot; said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
&quot;It looks like the situation is really bad,&quot; he added.
Central banks are concerned that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers more expensively.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with possible effects on economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still wary of lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
&quot;It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,&quot; Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks will help to avert the crisis because it does not address the underlying problem, which is the collapse of the US housing market.
Klaus: Environmentalists&#39; debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been leveled at the concluding international UN conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he said that the environmentalists&#39; debates were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
&quot;The debate there is completely unstructured, it&#39;s just fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems,&quot; Klaus said.
When introducing his book, the Czech president emphasized that its topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book appears in a German translation, because, as he said, &quot;I often only come across caricatures of my views&quot;.
Now those interested can read his unbiased views.
Klaus reminded that he is not a climatologist, but in his opinion he has enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main conclusions of the book, he identified the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that not all scientists agree on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not represent a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are useless , ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous limitation of freedom.
To questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against &quot;reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits&quot;.
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver did not have time to change 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not have time to exchange their old driver&#39;s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for a replacement so that the authorities can issue them a new card before the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will hit the road after the New Year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who no longer want to drive did not change their license.
While municipalities report a sharp drop in interest in exchanging driver&#39;s licenses, authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed with requests and interest in exchanging licenses increased this week.
The municipality handles around 2,000 clients a day.
Waiting in queues takes about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver&#39;s license.
It takes twenty days to issue a new card.
However, it is possible to request an issue within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will pay an additional five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not have time to change their license before the end of the year, and who hit the road without a valid driver&#39;s license, will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also resolve the offense by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offense, the fine is 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information, even a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine from the town hall.
At the same time, he could allegedly pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be lenient and impose a maximum fine of 1,000 kroner.
According to Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, no one is in danger of fines of tens of thousands.
According to him, a driver&#39;s license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not a valid ID that every person must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver&#39;s license.
Just take it away or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
Passes issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid at the end of the year.
However, motorists must also gradually exchange other types of driver&#39;s licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange them.
Passes issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, these are roughly 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych&#39;s gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years, respectively.
The Prague High Court decided on this with final validity, which reduced their sentences, one by one year and the other by two years.
Originally, the detectives of the Prague Department for the Fight against Organized Crime faced 14 and 12 years.
Today&#39;s decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also indicted in this case, he is only waiting for the first-instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences totaling more than 16 years in other trials.
He can&#39;t get more.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, and today the High Court dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused rejected the indictment from the beginning of the investigation, saying that it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police, in agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment concerns the gang&#39;s criminal activities from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injury, but also about the abuse of authority of a public official and illegal weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, bullets with a steel core, a laser sight and a submachine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang made tens of millions of crowns through robberies.
In addition to almost twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych&#39;s neighborhood are still confessing before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet come before the court.
The main trial has so far avoided Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they await a final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Baby swap bill: 12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the injured families, wants compensation of 12 million crowns from the hospital in Třebíč, plus court costs, for switching children in the maternity hospital.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the father and one million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore fundamentally disagrees with Veleba&#39;s proposal.
&quot;We reject such a demand, it is very, very high,&quot; said Dostál after today&#39;s meeting.
&quot;However, in order to form an opinion about the counter-proposal, we need an expert report that the opposing party had drawn up.
We will find out if it has any telling value at all.
But we remain of the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone,&quot; emphasized Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month that they did not raise their biological daughter.
An expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motola served as a basis for Veleb&#39;s compensation negotiations.
According to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatrists, the parents of the children suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even if they were faced with regrets that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, have a harder time coping with the actuality of the experienced trauma and with what is happening right now, Veleb summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola were exchanged by nurses at the maternity hospital in Třebíč last December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák family in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families to compensate for the expenses incurred by them due to the error of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is establishing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against liability for damage.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for help from the founder.
Courts have so far awarded relatively low compensation to people, the amounts were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Polívka lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Wallachian Kingdom trademark.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, although the King of Wallachia used the name for the first time, the project was built by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not participate in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and the client will appeal.
&quot;The dispute is about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka,&quot; Polívka&#39;s lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, when everyone thinks of the Kingdom of Wallachia, they think of actors and comedians.
Harabiš has the same opinion.
&quot;Almost ten years of work is behind us.
Raising money and coming up with events,&quot; he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
&quot;After years they realized that the project was successful and could get something out of it.
They want to interfere with our work,&quot; he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the Wallachian king used Polívka for the first time in his TV show.
In 1993, actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But then it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary event turned out to be a trade and lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then followed up with the foundation of the Wallachian Kingdom company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to put his name and signature on passports and even offered their holders discounts on visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Polívka published in the arena for his business plan.
&quot;The popularity of Boleslav Polívka&#39;s Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped,&quot; said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of the now feuding parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition of &quot;King Boleslav I. elected for the furt&quot;.
At the instigation of Harabiš, singer Jarmila Šuláková took on the leading role in the kingdom as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Harabish&#39;s upcoming battle for the throne and half of the princess could bring clarity into the dispute.
A new king should emerge from him.
He did not want to reveal the details and date yet.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also apply,&quot; added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing prejudices
Truth be told, I&#39;ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not great, the quality of shifting, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But the Peugeot 207&#39;s successor is now on the market, and it&#39;s much better.
And the station wagon called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the rear seats.
That&#39;s the end of the complaints here, because the body of the station wagon means that even two-meter long people will not suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I will go over the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where the only complaint I have is the poor central tunnel.
I would have appreciated a little more design innovation here, when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and those are the days when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The lateral guidance has also been significantly improved against the 206 model.
As for the space, the increase in body dimensions can also be felt here.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of overhead space disappears.
Suitcases in a suitcase
The main thing about this car is its trunk.
I have to rate it as very accessible (also thanks to the flip-up rear window) and decently stowable.
The deaf spots are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not get in the way, it can be stretched and at the same time it holds even heavier objects.
But let&#39;s dwell together on the volume.
According to the tables, it is 428 l in the basic configuration, which is more of an average value compared to the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot lags behind by a very noticeable 52 liters.
This value is critical for vacations abroad or when loading a stroller.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a 1.6 ls four-cylinder gasoline engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-seat car driving a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it with the Škoda equivalent, which sometimes seems as if it has a rag stuffed into the exhaust, then I can only be delighted with it.
The price list will tell you
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a petrol engine for 329,900 CZK is still affordable.
Our unit costs from CZK 410,900, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment then adds equipment for another 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, electric rear windows...
Simply put, the car costs 531,900 CZK.
It&#39;s a lot, but add up the optional equipment on the Fabia and you&#39;ll arrive at a very similar number.
So all that remains is to decide on a brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not going well
The number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing in British schools, which raises concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans still faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the native population escalate into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in North Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and fights between pupils have also spilled over into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham the police arrested a Slovakian woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
Guilty, she defends herself that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly showered the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
&quot;When we were walking home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us, and then exposed his ass,&quot; the mother of the Slovak pupils described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local homesteaders even described disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who came here for work.
Around 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can come true if you choose it right.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, as calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
But you can find much more on just one island, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and transshipment point for the treasures that the Spanish looted in America and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the USA (especially during prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings rose in Havana, cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s drove along the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of Havana&#39;s Bodeguita.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, they will mix you a cocktail of your choice.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s still drive around Havana, because the once-imported Zhiguli and Fiats have long since rotted in the salty and humid air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is very dilapidated, there are still as many beautiful colonial monuments in the vicinity as there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in much-needed money, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the Holguín province, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pleasure that is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by train riders.
Cane from vast plantations was brought to the sugar mills by steam and motor trains on narrow tracks.
Their vehicle fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so you can see working machines, the likes of which can only be found elsewhere in museums.
Where to go?
Most visitors to Cuba do not miss the most famous places.
And so there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Just to remind you that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
Lush vegetation grows from the limestone bedrock.
Mogots, limestone boulders and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, and fertile soil has taken hold in their cavities, thanks to which even the weathered cliffs are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final form if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Maybe someone will find it interesting that the Chilean part of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought him fame and fortune.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and showiness of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road connecting it to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was being built there, and therefore nothing was being torn down either, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at the interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the valley of the Sugar Bowls.
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music dies down in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
The journey itself certainly influences such an opinion.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that has hardly been affected by human activity.
Thanks to its unspoilt nature, the eastern island of Cuba has been included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
They make the best chocolate there, they have a Columbus cross in the church (actually it was created about a hundred years after Columbus&#39; voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today&#39;s hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about the Sierra Maestra mountains, about the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the shrine of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves, all of this would be could take many pages to describe.
But, as they say, better seen once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
According to the United States, the lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment affects the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, the eight participating states are also discussing further plans and coordination of the allies today.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to be more active, Great Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and increasing development aid.
&quot;The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to allow residents to start further development of the economy and security themselves,&quot; British Defense Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is the highest in five years, according to US military figures.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, even by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
&quot;We&#39;re going to have to think seriously about specific goals going forward and ways to achieve them,&quot; Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar vein today.
&quot;I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that is not enough,&quot; De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There have also been disputes among the countries involved in recent months over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
&quot;The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country,&quot; said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
&quot;Afghan loafers exposed: Germans play while our boys fight,&quot; the Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany&#39;s Bild went on the counterattack, printing a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will soar to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a state debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget management.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
It thus increased by 40.2 billion crowns in nine months of this year.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech owes more than 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state was in debt by more than 111 billion crowns.
&quot;For the time being, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could only cross the threshold of one trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt should range between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,&quot; said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly: &quot;We could reach the one trillion mark in the course of 2009.
When exactly it will depend on the next budget, which we don&#39;t know yet.
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could be moved to 2010.
But I don&#39;t expect this change,&quot; he said.
Debts are growing
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government and arises mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The national debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state&#39;s internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion so far this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
So far this year, the state&#39;s foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
&quot;Total debt rose 13 percent year-on-year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It&#39;s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when the pension reform is here,&quot; Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
It follows from the financing and management strategy of the state debt for 2007 that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget management.
The amount mainly consists of the deficit of the state budget, which will probably reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the predicted 91.3 billion crowns.
In addition, the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are 13.3 billion crowns, a reserve of ten billion crowns for the payment of pensions, the financing of state bonds for 43 billion crowns and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to fifteen days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday evening and deported, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting six- to seven-year-old pupils name a teddy bear Muhammad despite any depiction of the prophet of Islam being banned.
She was subjected to the punishment of whipping.
The 54-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education .
Our story actually begins already in the month of September, when the teacher in question asks her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
&quot;Eight names come out of the children&#39;s mouths, among them Hasan, Abduláh and Mohamed,&quot; says school director Robert Boulos.
After the class votes, 20 of the 23 children end up choosing Muhammad as the most popular name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a teddy bear accompanied by the caption: &quot;My name is Mohamed&quot;.
The teddy bear itself did not have a tag with this name on it, but the problem lies in the very depiction of the prophet, which is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the fellow Muslims, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, specified that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: &quot;My only regret is that she asked the children to vote for some name&quot;, according to him, it is only an &quot;innocent mistake&quot;.
Such an opinion is shared by many of the teacher&#39;s students, who describe her as &quot;very attentive to her students&quot; and add that she &quot;never talks about religion in class&quot;.
Recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most commonly given first name in Great Britain, with fourteen different spellings in English.
Often chosen by Muslim families, this first name is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it&#39;s a matter of interpretation.
In the latest round of negotiations in Vienna this Wednesday, they failed to reach an agreement on the province&#39;s future status.
Ultimately failure.
Serbs and Kosovar Albanians concluded the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their differing views on the future status of the separatist province.
&quot;It is regrettable that the two sides were not able to reach an agreement on the status,&quot; European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, emphasized that peace in the region is &quot;at stake&quot; and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
&quot;We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a challenging period&quot;, he added, adding that &quot;it is evident that the situation is tense&quot;.
Negotiations end on December 10
Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90 percent Albanian-speaking, could emerge in a brighter light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Kharchenko are due to deliver their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN tasked the Troika with new negotiations in August this year.
The Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10.
On the other hand, the Russians, who previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue even after this deadline.
&quot;Russia was and remains in favor of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,&quot; said Bocan-Charchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration by the international community, the West sees Kosovo&#39;s independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that it is ready to declare independence unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favor.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
&quot;Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement&quot;, announced the president of the Kosovo self-government, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel, where these &quot;last chance negotiations&quot; have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former Kosovo Albanian rebel commander and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade &quot;belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations&quot;.
&quot;domino effect&quot;
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still possible and has warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade is said to particularly fear a &quot;domino effect&quot; in the region, which is still unstable as a result of the independence wars of the 1990s.
&quot;For Serbia, however, this does not mean&quot;, he said, &quot;that a compromise is impossible&quot;.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions rest solely with the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
&quot;Kosovo parliament will have the last word&quot;
&quot;For Serbia, only a solution arising from the Security Council is acceptable&quot;, declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
&quot;These negotiations lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the soil of the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu replied to journalists that &quot;the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament&quot; and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population were to occur, it would take place &quot;after an agreement&quot; with the West.
Bush forced an agreement on the Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called at his instigation, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately start negotiations with the intention of resolving once and for all the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything to help them conclude a &quot;peace treaty&quot; before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy &quot;terrorist infrastructure&quot; and Israel must end its colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides stemming from the &quot;road map&quot; to peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim to &quot;conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues.&quot;
The statement covers three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Taking over from the US president, Abbas emphasized that the subsequent negotiations would be &quot;comprehensive and thorough&quot; and touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning &quot;Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others &quot;.
Then Olmert took to the podium, who expressed the opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be &quot;direct and continuous&quot; and that it is necessary to &quot;make an effort to conclude them during 2008&quot;.
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for realizing his &quot;vision of two states&quot;, Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had received a commitment to that effect from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal accepted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories seized in the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means &quot;a crossroads in the history of the Middle East mainly because it fights against the roots of the conflict and against its central aspects&quot;, judges Prince Saud in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper sponsored by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such minor news from the black chronicle, the official version does not match what is being said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the General Inspection of the French National Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car was passing through Louise-Michel street in the municipality of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
&quot;The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but was on patrol and was driving at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, while not having its side lights on,&quot; explains a police source.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, &quot;unregistered and therefore not authorized to ride on public roads&quot; (read below), driven by two youths without a helmet, was traveling at &quot;a very high speed&quot;.
&quot;The motorcycle rammed into the police car from the left side after not giving way from the right,&quot; explained one policeman.
A blood alcohol per mille test conducted on the vehicle&#39;s crew came back negative.
The condition of the car (punctured front end, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise), Marie-Thérèse de Givry, reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN has commissioned an investigation into &quot;acts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger&quot;, which is also being undertaken by the direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val -d´Oise (headquarters of the regional police of the Val d´Oise department).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
Three witnesses to the accident who were questioned on Sunday evening, according to the official, confirmed &quot;the version of the police, namely that the mini-motorcycle approached them relatively quickly from the left&quot;.
A rut, no doubt caused by the clips rubbing against the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Word quickly spread in Villiers-le-Bel yesterday that the police officers should have left the scene quickly without giving first aid to the two youths.
The IGPN should, in all caution, also rule out &quot;any serious wrongdoing&quot; on this point.
&quot;It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation that requires more searching and with which one must be very careful,&quot; said a police source.
The newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; met an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
At the same time, one of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
&quot;Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to revive them,&quot; said this witness.
I couldn&#39;t do anything&quot;.
He then saw &quot;a limping, completely terrified policeman.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young men and a fourth was on the phone.&quot;
Faced with the rapidly increasing tension and the certainty of those present that the situation of the young people was hopeless, the police officers were taken away by the car of their colleagues, who had meanwhile arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived &quot;about twenty minutes after the departure of the policemen&quot;.
They also performed CPR but to no avail.
&quot;Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush to help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them,&quot; the prosecutor emphasized.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday quelled the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, around 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas shells, which witnesses said were used by security forces.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios to those in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen assaulted and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of around five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were barricaded on Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the lawyers&#39; movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president &quot;encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those sworn in before Musharraf.&quot;
&quot;Musharraf&#39;s promise does not apply&quot;
Pakistan&#39;s Supreme Court is a direct target of the emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next few days, he was supposed to comment on the legality of President Musharraf&#39;s re-election in the indirect presidential election that took place on October 6.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
&quot;Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the judgments of the Supreme Court,&quot; the official told The News.
Pervez Musharraf&#39;s promise to relinquish leadership of the army and become a civilian president &quot;does not apply&quot; following the imposition of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government also refuted ongoing speculation in the country, according to which the deputy chief of the army should have ordered President Musharraf under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unintended
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Today, more than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected, reveals a study conducted by the French Institut national d&#39;études démographiques (Ined) - the State Institute for Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth&#39;s law, which legalized contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
After all, the enactment of contraception has enabled better &quot;fertility control&quot;, the institute claims, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception among women between the ages of 20 and 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten today tend to be well planned.
One couple out of five even has the birth calculated for the month exactly and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) spent more than seven hours working in space to make a remarkable repair of a torn solar panel necessary for the station&#39;s continued scientific activities.
It was a risky spacewalk that set records for duration, distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was planned and the amount of &quot;tinkering&quot; that astronauts spent on repairs.
The trouble emerged on Tuesday as astronauts from Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical structure designed to house a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a sort of landing pad for the lab modules.
However, they must be able to be supplied with electricity.
Therefore, the crew&#39;s second task was to move the seventeen-and-a-half-ton module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so that it was docked in its final location.
After moving it, the crew began to dismantle the module&#39;s sixty-seven meter solar panels.
And in that one of the panels, unfolding like an accordion, as a result of the cable being pinched, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Unfolding was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control ascent on Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had malfunctioned, were forced to attend to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the ship&#39;s robotic arm, added to the station&#39;s arm, and make the repair.
He is one of the best &quot;spacewalkers&quot; (spacewalker) of the American Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, stout, very agile, has a very developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor by profession was tasked with &quot;operating&quot; on an &quot;injured&quot; solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the defective cable and attached some kind of &quot;splints&quot; to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second &quot;spacewalker&quot; who remained near the buffer chamber, as well as from the inside by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew chief.
The tool he used, namely a mini-hockey stick covered with an insulating agent to prevent electric shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was invented and &quot;homemade&quot; by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully disassembled before inventorying his tools and returning to the interior of the station.
Astronauts enjoyed a half-day of rest yesterday afternoon before today, when the seven astronauts return to Discovery for their scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defense company said it would have to spend between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros to deal with A400M delays.
EADS lost 4% and is now at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The financial group has been forced to reassess its forecasted production results for 2007 due to delays arising from the slow progress of development of the A400M aircraft engine, which is a condition of the inaugural flight.
The price for easing delays in the delivery of the military cargo plane, announced in October, was calculated &quot;at 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus&quot;, announced the parent company of the European designer EADS.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new outlook for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday when it presents its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Let us recall that EADS&#39; production results in 2006 fell by 86% mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group assumed that it would provide the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
A decision for the status quo
Sunday&#39;s election will take place without tense expectations: Russians will overwhelmingly choose President Putin&#39;s party, United Russia.
Thus confirming, after the end of a very little free election campaign, his gravitation towards stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded televised message to voters on public broadcasters, the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so from the position of leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that looks set to celebrate a landslide victory.
As he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president made no bones about it, contenting himself with yet another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite theme during the campaign.
&quot;We know the price of true democracy and wish for honest, as transparent and open elections as possible, elections without the slightest blemish on beauty,&quot; he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that &quot;there have never been such dirty elections, not even under Yeltsin&quot;.
Following the crackdown on last weekend&#39;s demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in jail for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
&quot;The Russians have the homo sovietica mentality&quot;
In the background of these parliamentary elections devoid of tense expectations, two far more open questions loom:
- &quot;Who will become Putin&#39;s successor in the presidency?
Yesterday, the Official Gazette published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
However, no follower appears.
- &quot;What role will Putin play after March?&quot;
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will choose the government and the president?
Be that as it may, the outgoing ruling power will win across the board in parliamentary as well as presidential elections.
It&#39;s a tradition.
&quot;Russians are left with the homo sovietica mentality, they don&#39;t feel like they are the masters of their destiny,&quot; believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolay Kopossov from the State University of Saint Petersburg notices more distant connections in time: civil society took up a delay in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; that famous communal spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, &quot;Putin continued a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic well-being&quot;, believes Maria Lipman from the Carnegie Foundation.
Russians today &quot;voluntarily give up personal responsibility&quot;, which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
&quot;Why think?&quot;
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
Even the bureaucratic elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run local United Russia candidates.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Čeredničenko, a fifty-four-year-old professor: &quot;Why think?
Those in power aren&#39;t that bad, so why change them?&quot;
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years of secrecy, the Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which recount the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler&#39;s regime, are being opened to the public.
The 47 million archive documents stored over a length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were until now only accessible for &quot;humanitarian&quot; purposes, that is, individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of managing the archives - which include Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening became effective yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to examine &quot;in particular the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of the forced laborers&quot;, explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, Germany among them, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some of the information.
What are the assumed homosexuality or mental disabilities of some victims of deportation.
Concentration camp registers or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor civilians, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
&quot;Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents&quot;, said prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India already reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India&#39;s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath have announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India already reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India&#39;s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU&#39;s ninth trading partner.
&quot;The free trade agreement will boost both economies enormously&quot; and &quot;India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans&quot;, Peter Mandelson testified.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner specified. The Asian and European giants exchange &quot;47 billion euros in goods&quot; and &quot;ten billion euros in services&quot; annually, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission&#39;s delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regretting that bilateral trade &quot;has not yet reached its full potential.&quot; The EU and India will meet on Friday for the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosa.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England signaled on Thursday that it intends to ease current fears that conditions in the credit market will deteriorate again, announcing an offer of 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer valid for an unusually long period.
&quot;In an effort to ease concerns that conditions in the financial markets will be very adverse at the end of the year and to give banks greater confidence in how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period which will begin December 6 in the form of a five-week operation on the open market&quot;, she announced in a communiqué.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed in the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the base interest rate.
It appears to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They normally last a week.
The BOE added in its communique that it &quot;remains prepared to take further measures to keep interest rates&quot; on interbank loans at the same level as its base rate on a day-to-day basis.
The intraday interbank rate was at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates that have discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to certain speculations, strengthened by the development of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many preferred to opt for the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for the People&#39;s Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Center) refuse to deal with the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Center clubs refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist bill on purchasing power on Thursday, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
The text of the draft law was put on the agenda as part of the so-called of the socialist &quot;nest&quot; (a meeting initiated by an individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which was an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the restoration of fluctuating TIPP, a transport check or rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the television appearance of Nicolas Sarkozy about purchasing power.
The head of the PS deputies, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amending bill on finance, which the Chamber will discuss next week.
A new festival is born
Following much speculation that C3 Presents was starting a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer has announced New Jersey&#39;s Vineland Festival in association with British promoter Melvin Benn&#39;s Festival Republic.
&quot;It&#39;s an honor for our company to work with a man who, without exaggeration, inspired the current festival movement in America,&quot; Charlie Jones of C3 revealed to Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago&#39;s Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
Director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world&#39;s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989 he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006 Festival Republic founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organizing duties of the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3&#39;s Charlie Jones calls Glastonbury &quot;the most inspiring event&quot; he has ever seen and says his company and Melvin Benn&#39;s are working side by side to give the region a European-style festival event.
&quot;We originally chose Philadelphia as our market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish the festival in downtown Philadelphia,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
&quot;I dealt with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, due to the current city management, we are bogged down in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to create a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.&quot;
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza in Chicago&#39;s Grant Park in 2005, after breaking out on the festival scene in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales for both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in urban settings.
&quot;The European model of the Melvin Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in the green spaces of the cities&quot;, says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way in order to create the impression of both a European-style rural festival and an American-style urban one.&quot;
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
&quot;The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting this event,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the deal, but claims &quot;that they are favorable enough to allow us to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will hopefully have a long duration&quot;.
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is &quot;very high&quot;, similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which holds 80,000 people.
He says invitations have already been sent out to groups, but nothing can be confirmed as the program goes to press.
&quot;Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music there will be varied to attract as wide a range of viewers as possible&quot;, says Carlie Jones.
C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at last year&#39;s Billboard Touring Awards, is partnered by Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It&#39;s not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuasive mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is &quot;politically demanding&quot; because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemns &quot;runaway productions&quot;.
Is it difficult to fall into the clutches of the &quot;Governor&quot;??
&quot;You have to be careful, it&#39;s the industry that decides where it&#39;s going to go.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he will go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider the best&quot;, he said.
Hunt for festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte&#39;s priority is promoting local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
All the West Coast festivals, whether it&#39;s in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about introducing Quebec films, highlighting them and having the directors give interviews.
The Dark Ages got some good publicity at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th annual Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
this month, Québec also presented four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year? Experts were divided by the &#39;subprime&#39; crisis
With less than five weeks left until the end of the administrative year, investors are already wringing their hands in anticipation of the traditional year-end marathon.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Bank Banif believes that &quot;from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive course on the stock market&quot;.
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context the markets present, at least in the short term, certain doubts&quot;.
These experts do not expect the stock market to move in the last weeks of the year and state that &quot;the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income affected by the effect of turnover to quality securities, as in long so in short sections&quot;.
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, &quot;mainly because the impact of the likely drop in FED (Federal Reserve System) rates, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of stimulus to inflationary pressures, is not known&quot;.
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that now is not the right time to make bold statements that there will be a marathon.
&quot;There are not too many reasons to be happy&quot;, assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% from the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Nevertheless, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the reshuffle of portfolios and traditional superannuation deposits that happen every year around this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the long weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The aforementioned analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and &quot;that is why we could observe a rebound in the index, triggered by news from the US about the consequences of the crisis on the credit market&quot;.
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will take care of bringing the Ibex to new maximums.
Intermoney&#39;s Solana confirms that &quot;it&#39;s the turn of strong titles this year&quot;.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio &quot;because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive&quot;.
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich on this marathon if it happens.
&quot;ACS has been regaining its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path&quot;, explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the fore in the latter part of the year thanks to increased sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also do very well, even if this field is not well represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December was a month of decline only twice.
The real year-end marathon took place in 2003, the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, with the Ibex 35 recovering 28.17%, December saw a 6.68% gain.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Bank Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
Two hundred in all, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches, operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decided to take such a leap and bet on continuous opening hours of its branches until 8:30 p.m. and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that has also assured several times that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, it intends to strike a deal with unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturdays in exchange for extending opening hours by one afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for whether or not other entities join this initiative, which supports store opening hours.
This is precisely the goal of the project set by Bank Popular.
To acquire individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, entrepreneurs and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing ones.
For that reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
The extension of opening hours is thus complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
The bank&#39;s commercial director, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a big investment, but more staff recruitment, as it goes from six employees per branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches on Madrid&#39;s Bravo Murillo, O&#39;Donnell and Gran Vía streets were chosen, and according to Rivera, it appears to have been a lucky choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized for immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where many of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
&#39;We don&#39;t want to compete with our clients,&#39; says Rivera.
They have just agreed with Telefónica to sell mobiles through external staff.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time on the stock exchange
We did it&#39;.
Yesterday, Paolo Vasile, the executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction with this sentence at the end of trading, when he noted that the television he manages has doubled the value of its rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: &#39;what I regret is that it did not happen because we rose more, but because we fell less&#39;, he declared.
And he emphasized that thanks to the weak market, &#39;we fell less&#39;.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday with a move of 2.54%.
This gain pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg data, the stock market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) reaches 4,488.88 million euros.
Its competitor Antena 3, down 1.52% yesterday and down 40.5% overall since January, is half worth 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were evaluated is 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2.518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasile, a comparison with Antena 3 is possible because &#39;we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in viewership&#39;.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first TV channel to surpass a billion in gross advertising revenue this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group&#39;s advertising arm.
If the predicted figure is actually achieved, the TV channel would see an increase in advertising revenue of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net income of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative performance of Telecinco on the stock market is the increased pay out that it has maintained until now: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
&#39;We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol&#39;.
According to analysts, the market is showing a certain fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its earnings estimates for Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because, they explain, projected earnings growth has stalled from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same firm cut Antena 3&#39;s forecast earnings by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles primarily based on increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: rates Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (hold) due to its &#39;numerous strengths&#39; and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases recommends not to overestimate them, as they face &#39;similar threats&#39; (oversaturated market and deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approved the transposition of MiFID effective from 1 November
In parallel with parliamentary deliberations, which ended today with Congress voting on amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that develops the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of individual parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities needed for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernization of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Commission for the Securities Market (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of Financial Services Firms (ESIS), Financial Advisory Firms (AFI), which join securities companies, securities brokerage offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for executing operations in financial instruments is expanding, with regulated secondary markets being joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law further obliges companies providing investment services to disseminate information on the market about key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and methods of dealing with risk, and requires keeping a report of all operations performed to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
During the deliberations in the Congressional Commerce Committee, several modifications were included, among which the securitized receivables are considered a &quot;complex&quot; financial instrument due to the high danger for the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the US with subprime mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delineate the positions that bachelors in economics and business management can hold, 30 years after a royal decree was approved in 1977 delineating professional positions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require a permit from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in a timeliness and quality comparable to that achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute of Statistics) reminded that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure that will be known on December 14 of this year.
&quot;ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level&quot;
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% was a &quot;temporary number&quot;, but he also predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively &quot;high level&quot; in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes specified in the corridors of Congress that &quot;even if it will not be a favorable number&quot;, the inflation differential of Spain vis-à-vis the monetary union is still &quot;more or less&quot; the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November &quot;was less surprising&quot; than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
&quot;We expected a value of around 4%&quot;, said the Minister of Economy regarding the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make €42 billion from Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock fell into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually fell over the course of two and a half months due to client distrust, despite the fact that the government offered a 100% guarantee for this money and will extend it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity&#39;s name with its commercial finance brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the income deposited with UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18bn to reach its £30bn target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for his eye-catching advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week identified a bid from Virgin, a consortium of three other companies, as the one it would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totany arrested for alleged corrupt practices during construction
In the early hours of today, the Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of Murcia, Totana (from the People&#39;s Party), due to his alleged involvement in the corrupt construction practices that were revealed this week.
One of the secretaries of the town hall and the chief of the local police were also arrested.
In May of this year, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People&#39;s Deputy and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER television, could be the &#39;head&#39; of the entire enterprise.
Police officers continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the building commission, and further arrests are not excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the construction&#39;s corrupt practices that were exposed earlier this week, was indicted.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the &#39;people&#39;s&#39; MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested while leaving Morales&#39; residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigative sources, Morales&#39; alleged collection of commissions for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company reclassifying 200 hectares of land is also under investigation.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to head the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, to preside over the Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist General Secretary José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers&#39; Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election and become president if the Socialists win the general election Congress.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE&#39;s secretary for the organization, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting with Zapatero, which took place this afternoon at the party&#39;s federal headquarters.
The head of the executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life &quot;it is important to count on the best&quot; and Bono &quot;is among the best&quot;.
He further noted that &quot;yes, it seems&quot; that the politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party&#39;s candidate for Congress President if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as Speaker of Congress, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and to leave his active political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister constantly urged him to return to top politics, which he left two years ago.
He further stated that just as the citizens know who will be the Deputy Minister of the Economy if the PSOE wins the elections, his party wanted to announce in a &quot;transparent manner&quot; who will preside over the Congress.
If Bono gets the job, he hopes to transform the House of Commons into &quot;a house of respect and not of swearing or shouting&quot; and make it &quot;more and more like the citizens&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can&#39;t talk in peace and quiet is the Congress, the Prime Minister was interrupted 26 times in the Senate on one occasion&quot;.
He also spoke highly of the current president Manuel Marín and &quot;his good work&quot; and did not want to imagine himself in his place just yet, so as not to stoop to what he said his opponents could consider &quot;grandiosity&quot;.
Climate propaganda
As the climate change movement subjects both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles to ruthless persecution, it must demonstrate strong cohesion.
And to have a leader of the movement who is the prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a &quot;new contract with the planet&quot;.
This proposal forces him to explain why his government&#39;s actions or inactions have significantly contributed to Spain leading the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-performance, in which industries is it happening and why did his government, the treaty government, not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spanish what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, which energy savings, both individual and collective, will we have to accept and what will be the economic consequences.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But we have not received, nor will we receive, such explanations.
Precisely because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Action on climate change, real action, is unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening business and personal accounts.
Even the one centime on the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers&#39; Socialist Party), seemed so electorally risky to Zapatero that he was quick to reject it.
In other words, it&#39;s about saving the planet at no cost, pure propaganda, slogans devoid of any real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not accuse, does not demand anything, but is an ornament of meetings and arouses tenderness.
As long as it&#39;s limited to just being a virtual contracting party and doesn&#39;t ask us to ride our bikes and cool off with a fan.
The mayor and local police chief of Totany detained on suspicion of corrupt practices during construction
As investigative sources reported, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totano, the &quot;people&#39;s man&quot; José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one entrepreneur in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during the construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located, together with a number of police officers, who also appeared before the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
The three arrests were added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into land suitable for development to the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal kickbacks over the past election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested, but are accused in summary proceedings in the court of first instance of the city of Totana.
The six first arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People&#39;s Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
Also accused were his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel NA, the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José MG, the director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the said group and through which the bribes were transferred.
The investigation is being carried out by the crime group under construction of the operational central unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to those arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and Totan.
At the time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a very well-known owner of a poultry products company in the area, who could have served as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group has been commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totany, which would include the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two &quot;spa&quot; hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was requalified, and its project was supposed to double the population of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of A Coruña, Venezuela and in Fernando el Católico square in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on for promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

If you don&#39;t mind, we&#39;ll leave the Book of the Month aside and maybe think of other awards and competitions in the meantime.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday&#39;s edition of the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (incidentally at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, the same day that they agreed there a critic of Blackburn&#39;s book discovered the circumstances:
&quot;The content of the philosophy course penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the town of Jokela.
The killer of the victims, a high school student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the councilor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical position on Plato and argued that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic philosophy course in secondary schools.

One colleague reports on the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the criminal code:
A. Downloading one song would be a felony punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal records in a store with a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere misdemeanor (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for towing (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than to exchange compacts.
Participating in rioting has a sentence of three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and exchanging compacts would have a sentence of six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment on the job is considered less serious than downloading a movie to DVD under Penal Code § 184.2.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punishable than providing pornographic materials to minors (§ 186).
So, if my colleague is not mistaken, someone&#39;s hand has been lost, and badly.

My attending physician shoves me one of his articles on weird research titled &quot;Money Causes Brain Activation, Especially If Others Get Less.&quot;
In other words, the feelings that the monthly salary evokes among employees depend on how much their colleagues earn.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Imaging Neurocognition group at the Life&amp;Brain Institute in Germany: &quot;The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague responded incorrectly.&quot;
The researchers observed that if both succeeded, receiving the same salary, the activation was modest, but when one received double the activation was higher.
I really don&#39;t know if this conclusion required that much science.
Plaintiff of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her term expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died, former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach&#39;s documentary film &quot;Karlin&#39;s List&quot; (2006, not released in Spain) took its title, which, at the pace of a detective thriller, follows from Belgrade to New York the work of a Swiss prosecutor in the pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressure on the relevant states , to pull the net.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense that depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of driving license possession, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, it is necessary to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive an agreed insurance sum of a certain amount for taking responsibility for paying damages in the event of an insured event.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of driving license, type of vehicle being insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely you are to have a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, based on checks, insurance companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving and therefore the likelihood that it will have an accident.
As the frequency of trips increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when pricing premiums.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the type of insurance that best matches his policyholder profile.
Here we will show you the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages such as little driving experience and a short driving license when they want to get insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although all risk insurance is ideal for good coverage, there are cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for all risk insurance with a premium discount to get all risk cover but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the client&#39;s participation in the payment of the insurance event.
&quot;The part of the claim payment provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the premium price, which will be higher the lower the deductible,&quot; explains Luis Noguera, chief executive of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other road users, so that the client insures himself against damage caused to other people, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendation.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to lower your insurance premiums in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the insurance company has.
In contrast, a malus is an increase in the aforementioned base rate.
&quot;Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus&quot;, explains Noguera.
After crossing the twenty-five-year mark, drivers find it easier when they go to get insurance, because the client&#39;s risk index decreases thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks with a discount.
&quot;Young people usually cannot use the previously acquired experience at the time of the accident and even when driving&quot;, assures the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the &quot;newbie&#39;s fear&quot; has already been overcome. .
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which could amount to 300 euros) or, with a high bonus, insurance extended to other road users, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
&quot;Their driving is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount&quot;, points out Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which amounts to 150 euros) or insurance extended to other road users if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a valid reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us best given our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to get a point at AC Milan, which means the round of 16
AC Milan and Celtic will go head-to-head at the San Siro this Tuesday in a bid to get the point they need to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as it would mean first for the Italians and decide the place for the Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured their place in the fifth game with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine but need one more to ensure they are not overtaken by six-point Shakhtar, who will play Benfica, who have four .
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will start thirteenth in the semi-finals for the first time, in an attempt to progress to the final, which will be played on sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the rest and a tie at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza seems the most likely, although both teams will try to fight for victory, as the Italians will not want to tactic at home and Celtic know that with a win they would be first and secure would get a better place in the round of 16.
Even a loss could be enough for Gordon Strachan&#39;s side to progress if Shakhtar don&#39;t win, but they can&#39;t count on that as the Ukrainians, who lost 2-1 in Glasgow last week but won their first straight game, will progress on the same nine points (2:0).
And so the players of AC Milan will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe that they will reach the semi-finals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same game in the last competition with a goal from Kaká in extra time (1:0) after the score was 0: 0 in regular time.
Hoping that the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; will win will be Shakhtar, for whom the price of victory is only if Celtic loses, both for advancing to the round of 16 and for remaining in UEFA.
Benfica, although they are last and have no chance to continue in Europe&#39;s top competition, could reach third place with one win, so they would play in UEFA.
20,000 people attended the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls opened their first tour since they broke up in 2000 in front of 20,000 spectators in Vancouver, Canada.
&quot;Posh Spice&quot; (Victoria Beckham), &quot;Scary Spice&quot; (Melanie Brown), &quot;Baby Spice&quot; (Emma Bunton), &quot;Sporty Spice&quot; (Melanie Chisholm) and &quot;Ginger Spice&quot; (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started of their concert at Vancouver&#39;s GM Place stadium, said the reunion of their group was &quot;great&quot;.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video that recounts the history of the group that caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The comeback and world tour coincide with the release of their new album, released in Spain by EMI, featuring a selection of their major hits as well as two new songs, &quot;Headlines&quot; and &quot;Voodoo&quot;.
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by the husband of &quot;Posh Spice&quot;, British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was in the audience that flooded GM Place despite a nervous Victoria banning him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that &quot;he hasn&#39;t seen our costumes at all, so I&#39;m nervous about what he&#39;ll think of the show&quot;.
&quot;Sporty Spice&quot;, whose departure from the group in 1998 &quot;due to differences between us&quot; caused the five-piece to break up two years later, also showed her nervousness as she met the press two hours before the show started.
&quot;Iwas afraid.
I was nervous, but I could see that the world public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I&#39;m glad I did,&quot; Chisholm said of reuniting the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time &quot;things settled down and we all like each other very much&quot;.
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special.
An army of nannies was waiting for them at the airport upon arrival.
Pětice has a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will perform in California (USA), in San José (December 4) and in Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas row between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute over natural gas prices is currently ongoing between Russia and Ukraine, increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine&#39;s gas prices, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two reduced supplies to EU states last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia&#39;s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it gets from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
&quot;It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations,&quot; Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
&quot;Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.&quot;
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kyiv caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused exports to Western Europe to plummet, driving prices up sharply.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS &#39;must control foreign staff&#39;
The controller said NHS Scottish Chambers must improve criminal record checks on non-EU staff.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report highlighted that other key checks went well across a sample of five health authorities.
Immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport, the President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel recruited from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the doors of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court via videobridge accused of being linked to attempted bombings in the UK.
NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although Scottish health commissions use Disclosure Scotland for criminal record checks, the agency has no power to obtain such information outside of Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that commissions should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
&quot;Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not being carried out regularly,&quot; the report said.
Mr Black said NHS Scotland largely agreed with its own pre-employment vetting policy, but added: &quot;Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information is available on the number of foreign staff.&quot;
Chairman of BMA Scotland dr. Peter Terry said it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who might commit an act of terrorism in the future.
&quot;The report suggests that current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what further value the comments will bring,&quot; he said.
Scottish Health authorities have reported that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had a problem identifying personnel with residence permits.
The survey also found that established inspection procedures at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are being carried out to a large extent.
These included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the pre-employment checks policy and guidelines for overseas NHS workers.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: &quot;I wanted to get this job done in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.&quot;
She also added that the Scottish Government, in consultation with health commissions, will consider the report&#39;s recommendations and ensure best practice appears in updated guidelines on pre-employment checks for all staff - including overseas - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division dominate the film awards
Control, the biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, picked up five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Film.
Also receiving awards were star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before playing Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and supporting actor Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety award for bringing a British film to the world stage.
The awards ceremony was held at London&#39;s Roundhouse.
Control chronicles Curtis&#39; rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But it won Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously known for the iconic cover of U2&#39;s album Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and for best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner - as Julien Temple&#39;s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won Best Documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the best actor award for his role as the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Croenberg&#39;s London-based thriller Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on tough guy roles, has won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the next installment of Indiana Jones - Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
&quot;People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened doors for people like me,&quot; he added.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my man, a great actor of his time, I am very honored.&quot;
The independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury made up of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terror plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for being members of cells preparing an imminent attack on oil facilities as well as clerics and security forces.
The state television of the largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid-reaction force to defend facilities since a failed 2006 al-Qaeda attack on the world&#39;s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq.
The report cited an internal ministry statement: 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a &quot;missile launch expert&quot; who slipped into the country.
It further said that the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were supposed to be preparing the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and the US-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - encouraged by al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden&#39;s calls to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign housing complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
&quot;This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months,&quot; an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
Also arrested was a 16-member &quot;media cell&quot; in Medina that aimed to promote &quot;takfiri thinking&quot; - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into Earth&#39;s future
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may once have been a pleasant place for life.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more like Earth&#39;s wayward twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth&#39;s closest planetary neighbor.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit in similar orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and may have been habitable.
But the alarming greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and a slower rotation rate sent Venus down a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by hurricane-force storms and winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency&#39;s Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sobering look at how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from Oxford University&#39;s Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: &quot;It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different to Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
&quot;Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus started out like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, billions of years ago.&quot;
Police seized &quot;enriched uranium&quot;
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He would not confirm it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1m (£480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it&#39;s not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Even so, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters videotaped their questions and gave them to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, Nov. 28 were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party&#39;s YouTube debate.
But both the questions and the answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party heading into next year&#39;s election.
It is not clear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
This issue is one of the strongest Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the dial when they heard something heartening: the anchor saw approval spikes when the candidates talked about getting tough on the border.
The toughest and longest exchange came between Rudy Giuliani, the national front-runner, and Mr. Romney, who edged ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off a reputation as a man who was soft on illegal immigrants as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two sparred especially fiercely when pollsters asked whether either candidate would support &quot;amnesty&quot; (giving illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Minority candidates such as Duncan Hunter, Congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, Congressman from Colorado, have been able to throw their bit in the mill on this issue.
Neither of the two have a shot at the nomination, but both remain in the game perhaps because they started sounding the alarm about immigration earlier and stronger than others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same opinion: more strictness at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This issue, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other worries about the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the divide between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported gun ownership in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney debated whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbles through this to the point that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn&#39;t literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all odds in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his longtime Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Pressed to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning a laugh.
The fight remains remarkably open.
Mr. Huckabee&#39;s surge in Iowa coincides with recent fundraising successes and Ron Paul&#39;s loud cheers at Wednesday&#39;s debate.
These two have bounced back from the bottom as the two wings of the party still can&#39;t agree on better-known, more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party very early and convincingly with a winning message of American greatness on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour&#39;s pains
Gordon Brown has once again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is the norm in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No marriage orders appear to have been sold, no Paris hotel bills mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers sucked.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would have gotten away without it being discovered that a wealthy businessman had concealed £650,000 ($1.3 million) in contributions to the ruling Labor Party under other people&#39;s names for four years, without the party reporting it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and offended the British intelligentsia by claiming that the decision was not influenced by polls, there were hopes that he would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly witty Lib Dem deputy leader put it, the once-feared Mr Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The clumsy rescue of troubled bank Northern Rock exposed management weaknesses and poor judgment under fire.
Ill-conceived proposals to change the tax code have united companies against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people exposed unimaginable administrative blunders.
A trio of retired generals started a mutiny in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, arguing that being commander-in-chief was a part-time job.
Now here are the multifaceted gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour&#39;s general secretary (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is headed inexorably toward his end.
Even so, governments can reach a tipping point beyond which they find governing difficult.
The people don&#39;t trust politicians and don&#39;t like them, but they usually put aside their distrust when a new group takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not even be in office long, this relegation is gone: the civil service becomes leaky, ministers start giving briefings, the press looks for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one sense, Mr. Brown&#39;s position is particularly difficult because, compared to other political leaders, he cannot assume the position of a new broom.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the Inland Revenue records are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he wasn&#39;t directly involved in Blairite woes, such as the long-running investigation into party funding caused by &quot;ranks for money&quot;, voters can safely assume he was.
Still, Mr. Brown&#39;s predicament is not as bad as it seems.
The fumbles aren&#39;t as horrible as conservatives make them out to be.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was outright fooled.
And the cure, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Mr Brown&#39;s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr Abrahams, who likens his donations to charity, says he wanted no publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not his.
Laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might be buying access to those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said he was aware of Mr Abrahams&#39;s conduct but did not know it was illegal, is sure to be thoroughly questioned; so did Jon Mendlesohn, Labour&#39;s chief fundraiser, who became aware of the dodgy donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not implicated; there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these shenanigans, although the bulk of the payments did not take place until after he took office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He was quick to condemn this breach of law by his own party, but he diluted his resolve by reaching for a proven tool, a commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had one for six months, and moving forward with real reform of political party funding.
That would require embattled Labor to co-operate with the Tories and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the unions - a bitter pill for a stalwart like Mr Brown.
But he should face some simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to win is through unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis affecting the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally start to flutter around excitedly.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is languishing, predators have set their sights on the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if subprime mortgages spread to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of strain are evident.
The number of defaults (more than 30 days late in payment) and written-off accounts (accounts deemed uncollectible by the provider) are on the rise.
Last month, HSBC announced that it had lost $1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also due to bad credit card loans.
However, it is still too early to panic.
There are still few written-off accounts and defaults.
The 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below average, according to Moody&#39;s.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
A change in US personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to a sharp drop in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large portion of credit card losses; therefore, the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would rise regardless of whether general conditions for borrowers worsened.
The industry also shows a good repayment rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts each month.
And confidence in secured credit card securities is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research firm predicts that their emissions volumes for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct contagion routes between the subprime crisis and the credit card market: when home equity loans dry up, consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt.
However, credit card issuers look at cash flow rather than collateral values, so falling home prices don&#39;t necessarily mean a change in borrower credibility.
They may even be beneficial to lenders.
Consumers&#39; motivation to repay their mortgages decreases when their property value falls below the loan value; as a result, card debt moves up the list of priorities to pay off.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid changes in the prices of guaranteed items.
&quot;It&#39;s not going to happen one fine morning that we just renegotiate all the loans,&quot; says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
While the risk of a subprime-style explosion is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt deleveraging push America into recession, the credit card industry faces a bleaker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in a fraud involving former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas and pleaded guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud in which they and Fastow participated in a financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves at the expense of their employers.
They were due to appear in court in January.
However, during a retrial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. each pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.
The case of the three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, made headlines throughout the two years of the extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation started after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname &quot;The NatWest Troika&quot; -- alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to orchestrate the fraud with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in an Enron affiliate controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of the many Enron frauds that sent Enron spiraling toward bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch at zero, but our three Brits knew it was actually worth a lot.
A company under Kopper&#39;s control bought the bank&#39;s stake in that branch for $1 million.
The incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in the Greenwich branch of NatWest.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others pocketed roughly $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were free on $1 million bail, ordering them to remain in the United States pending an upcoming trial.
Enron, once the nation&#39;s seventh-largest company, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting gimmicks made it no longer possible to hide billions of dollars in debt or show failed speculations as profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension benefits.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company&#39;s downfall.
Skilling is serving more than twenty-four years in prison.
Lay&#39;s convictions on conspiracy, fraud and other charges were expunged after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow&#39;s non-helplessness
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for a non-stop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
However, for some of the Russian rich, it is a pittance to return.
&quot;It can carry up to 18 passengers,&quot; says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
&quot;But none of them are interested in so many places because it&#39;s for a close family or a company president.&quot;
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Show, a four-day orgy of lavish consumption at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury purveyors set up their booths, hoping to lure newly wealthy Russians with everything from mahogany-inlaid yachts to diamond-encrusted car dashes that 50 Cent wouldn&#39;t be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer cautiously looked back at the bright orange Porsche in the next booth.
&quot;It&#39;s a nice car, but it&#39;s fives and tenners against us,&quot; he said.
&quot;After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.&quot;
Money is pouring into the Russian capital on the waves of oil, just like when Dallas had its days.
&quot;We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans became enormously wealthy and gravitated to Europe, where they were seen as materialists,&quot; said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year fellow at Harvard&#39;s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world&#39;s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference drew Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $282 billion, according to Forbes magazine&#39;s list of the richest people.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a leading local institute in the field, released a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 &quot;second-rate&quot; millionaires in Russia, whose assets add up to 670 billion dollars.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
&quot;There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jeweler David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
&quot;All the women are impeccably groomed and the men are each worth a fortune.&quot;
As they walked through the halls in evening dresses on Sunday evening, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatovová and five-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
&quot;I&#39;ve been looking at the cars and I can&#39;t decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,&quot; said Miss Yumatov, who was decked out in designer clothes like a red carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a homebody.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the newly rich, brand-driven Russian buyers willing to sit in traffic for several hours to stroll through a warehouse that blaringly mixes Cadillac Escalades, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai, Gund stuffed animals and drafts.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
&quot;Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best,&quot; declared Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stall of Dutch porcelain maker Royal Delft in front of a larger-than-life reproduction of a Rembrandt painting from hand-painted blue tiles.
&quot;Obviously the Russians are more interested in tinsel.&quot;
And indeed, shopkeepers here say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known, limited-edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them shopped.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager for A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of LA Connection, a custom luxury car modification company, said he sold three chain-link-style grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner that had Swarovski crystal-encrusted spokes that looked like a roulette wheel.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
&quot;The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich skin bikes or a cubic zirconia portrait of his wife doesn&#39;t have to ride those bikes yet,&quot; Mr. Karapetian said.
“He stores them in his thirty to forty car garage.
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase &quot;Russian millionaire&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything too exclusive these days, given the big rise in property prices here.
&quot;If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,&quot; he said.
“There are more than you think.
Those who aren&#39;t millionaires could at least feign wealth at a booth run by Russian asset management firm Alliance Continental.
The company erected four red British-style phone booths stuffed with columns of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company&#39;s marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaire Fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around piles of cash, or to have friends take cell phone pictures of them relaxing in the midst of spare wealth, or simply to stuff their pockets with a few million.
&quot;You know, everyone can feel like a millionaire in Moscow,&quot; Mr. Karryev said.
New Jersey death possibly caused by botched operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the large windows of the A Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance pull up to a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined.
And then another.
&quot;Then I saw the medical examiner&#39;s van come in,&quot; said Mr Livingston, the restaurant controller.
“That&#39;s when I knew someone had died.
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, the executive assistant to the director of the Newar Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity police declined to release, who worked at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo&#39;s death and are hoping that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that has sent shockwaves through Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been Assistant to the Chief of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
&quot;She was loyal, tough and worked hard,&quot; Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
&quot;She was my shield.
She would protect me.&quot;
Mr. McCarthy said Miss Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County State&#39;s Attorney Theodora J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Miss Arroyo died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
&quot;It is one possibility,&quot; said Miss Walsh.
&quot;The investigation is still ongoing.&quot;
Authorities said they arrived at the home at approximately 3:00 p.m. on the 21st.
November and found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still have said little about their investigation or the home&#39;s owner, believed to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh did not say whether the authorities had interviewed Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a doctor&#39;s office.
No one answered the phone Wednesday at Miss Castro&#39;s house, with a damaged rose bush in the front yard and a barking Dalmatian out back.
Next to the door that led to the basement sat a blue barrel in the open garage with the words &quot;Ethyl Vanillin&quot; - a substance used as a vanilla substitute in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Ms. Arroyo provided him with invaluable help in navigating the intolerant and abrasive political culture of his new city.
&quot;She was like, &#39;You should watch out for this one or that one,&#39;&quot; he said.
“She was always there when I came in and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing.&quot;
Hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates lead to a strengthening of global stock markets
Share prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Reserve will try to ease lending conditions by further cutting interest rates were boosted by reassuring remarks from the vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Stocks jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the Fed&#39;s second-in-command to Ben Bernanke, said policymakers needed to be &quot;flexible and pragmatic&quot; in responding to continued pressure on financial markets.
In an apparent effort to calm jittery markets amid signs of a resurgent credit strain, Mr. Kohn said the recent jitters &quot;partially reversed some of the improvements in market performance toward the end of September and into October.&quot;
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility that the financial conditions of households and companies will further deteriorate will increase.
Investors see the remarks as a signal that the Fed is ready to inject more fresh capital into US markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid more bad news on the U.S. economy as home sales posted record lows in October.
The fallout from the financial turmoil was underscored by investment bank Bear Stearns&#39; announcement that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of a cost-cutting drive to offset heavy losses from a failed bet on subprime American home loans.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to be cut in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&amp;P 500 gained 2.65 percent.
London&#39;s FTSE 100 rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 strengthened by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit stress was on full display in the markets after the European Central Bank&#39;s auction of three-month money packages saw those funds lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and ECB in pumping extra money into London&#39;s money markets increased as the three-month UK interbank lending rate &quot;Libor&quot; rose to its highest since late September - 6, after an uninterrupted rise since November 12. 59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will bat at number six for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a larger context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who gets to make that decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who is at best on borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to help with the decision-making and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the chief manager of the English team, starts filling in applications for the post of national selector, although not necessarily full-time.
The one who doesn&#39;t bat in the sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair, and sports certainly aren&#39;t.
It is not easy to find what takes one to the top of his profession, while another never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the selection is difficult and requires judgment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is the time right for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah if so?
We could ask the same thing in another area, say here: John Edwards or &quot;Tubby&quot; Banerjee, both bright young executives with good education and industry insight, should be promoted to the commission - there&#39;s only room for one .
Who is to say which level is right for a cricketer when he is given no chance to sink or float to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, a cricketer needs to catch the captain&#39;s eye at the right moment if he is to take a wicket, and a batsman needs regular chances at opening positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the selector&#39;s eye is more complicated.
Last season, for example, there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test looks certain even if Stephen Harmison declares himself fit and bowls like a gunner.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs apiece.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at an equally meager average, but both have had their moments at the highest level and will be hoping for more.
Whether he will play at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may start or end the careers of both, or it may not have much of an impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and performed well in first-class, taking five wickets and conceding 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling for his place at the same time, who eventually emerged as a consistent Test cricketer, who, moreover, despite scoring two hundreds against Australia, is perhaps still underrated.
Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion following today&#39;s clean sheet at the Asirgiya Stadium, are more likely to follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah&#39;s greater experience to Bopar&#39;s youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
His scintillating and valuable debut Test innings of 88 in Mumbai and 32 first-class hundreds against Bopar&#39;s six speak for Shah, who, at 22, is seven years his junior and has excellent stats against spin pitches.
However, Shah made just ten runs in two innings in May against the Caribbean in a Test at Lord&#39;s, his Middlesex home ground, and that, coupled with the selectors&#39; immediate rejection when Vaughan wanted to re-insert him for the next match, his batting seems to have taken a hit from the vigor that was so evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex all-rounder has joie de vivre in his bones.
Nothing fazes him on the cricket field and his behavior off the field is epitomized by the recent overturn of a four-wheel drive car at an exhibition day for the England team&#39;s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was watching from a distance, to excitedly ask, &quot;Did you see that?&quot;
Bopara is definitely better in the field, delivering his medium-quick slip pitches on the pitches here, which he seems to suit, effectively and batting with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I&#39;m leaning towards Bopara getting his chance now, which is not to say that Shah won&#39;t excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he&#39;s the one playing here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against al Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, dumping refugees who had run out of money or expired visas and others who hoped the city was returning to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight the gunmen who drove them from their homes.
Mansoor bus station was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses.
&quot;I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,&quot; said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
&quot;I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
&quot;They say the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people,&quot; he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who has temporarily ordered his men to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaria called him saying that local militias, backed by the US military, had helped dislodge al-Qaeda from its positions in the west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is a Sunni-Shiite tribal leader who was driven from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
&quot;The day before yesterday, several friends called me and told me that they are starting a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaeda and that they need me and my boys&#39; support.
That&#39;s why I came back today,&quot; said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the appeal of pacification in the capital following the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local &quot;citizens&#39; groups&quot; who are defending their neighborhoods with guns in hand alongside the US military.
But more talked about the fact that they were forced to return by visa obstructions and a lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraq&#39;s sectarian killers.
&quot;Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis visas so they had to go back to Iraq,&quot; the Sunni pensioner said.
&quot;I can&#39;t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.&quot;
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, reducing tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to more fighting.
Little Saarland, good education
Germany&#39;s smallest federal state plays a leading role in vocational education, even excelling in the international orientation of its universities.
In only one area of education does Saarland suffer from the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
&quot;Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a person who is not from Saarland that we are not French&quot; - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a large role in the Saarland education system, which is in fifth place in the educational monitoring of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Which corresponds to a reasonably high share of foreign students, which amounts to 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saar children are accepted to university - many of them even without studying at a gymnasium.
&quot;In Saarland, a vocational education system is used&quot;, says Axel Plünnecke, IW&#39;s education expert.
Saarland is more than 7% above the German average, with more than one in five young people obtaining the right to study at a vocational school.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland offers a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two fields of study are the second best in the whole of Germany with regard to the number of inhabitants.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering courses.
&quot;After the first Pisa study, we implemented several reforms in general education schools,&quot; says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal states are also adopting.
Only future comparative studies will show if the results of the students improve significantly.
When the Pisa study was carried out in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And to Saarland&#39;s disappointment, the Pisa studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Saarland could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory at grammar schools - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
Soon the clocks in Venezuela will be different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will move the clocks back half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a laughing stock.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that according to the new law, the clocks will move by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American country will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the USA, justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States imposed the division of time zones on the world by whole hours.
In addition, on Wednesday local time, Chavez announced that he was cutting ties with neighboring Colombia due to the hostage crisis.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
&quot;I can no longer because of my self-respect,&quot; said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that citizens of the oil-rich country must vote on in a Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The row was sparked by Uribe&#39;s decision to withdraw Chávez&#39;s mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe &quot;spit in Venezuela&#39;s face&quot; with his decision, Chávez criticized Uribe on Sunday.
In Spain too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
A new mobile ringtone has caused a stir here: &quot;Por qué no te callas&quot; (Why aren&#39;t you quiet anymore?) - that&#39;s the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was uttered by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was so upset by the loud remarks of this left-wing populist at the recent Ibero-American summit that he silenced him in this way.
Germans are threatened with lower salaries in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of a real wage cut this year, despite the strong economy.
Experts justified their pessimistic forecast with a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower salary than last year.
&quot;The small wage increase, the value added tax increase and the increase in food and energy prices are to blame,&quot; Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) research institute told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also await in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labor Agency should not again fall into such trouble that it has to request loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspaper quoted this social democratic politician.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and petroleum products had driven inflation to its highest level in the last thirteen years.
In a year-on-year comparison, prices overall rose by three percent.
Venus is Earth&#39;s infernal twin
Despite its life-unfriendly atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that also occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that there is lightning on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles wrote in the scientific magazine Nature.
According to the well-known theory of the origin of primordial matter, life could have arisen on Earth thanks to lightning. Storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
This was not the case on Venus: &quot;If life ever existed there, it must have been a very long time ago,&quot; explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there would hardly be anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes the temperature here is around 500 °C.
&quot;Venus may be Earth&#39;s twin from hell, but it&#39;s a twin,&quot; Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, began to develop completely differently is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
Since no probe has been sent exclusively to study Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the study of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which were presented in several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
&quot;They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought,&quot; Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind vortices at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which rotates significantly faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth&#39;s northern hemisphere, writes the research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from Italy&#39;s Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of our solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and with a diameter of 12,100 km is almost the same size.
This planet known as Morning Star or Večernica orbits the Sun in almost 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble Earth with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bars (short for bar?), scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans, while it evaporated into space from Venus.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel&#39;s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to party disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the chancellorship.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after their meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler worries about Germany&#39;s reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the row over the Dalai Lama&#39;s reception.
&quot;We should not outwardly present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue,&quot; Köhler told the business newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed understanding for German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s (CDU) decision to receive the Dalai Lama in September.
&quot;Although I respect cultural differences, for me human rights have universal validity,&quot; Köhler said.
The Federal President emphasized that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
&quot;The Chancellor did not abandon the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows it too,&quot; Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disapproval of accepting the Dalai Lama and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the &quot;pretentious&quot; foreign policy of the coalition.
After the Dalai Lama&#39;s acceptance into the chancellorship, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao emphasized China&#39;s position.
The Dalai Lama&#39;s words and actions have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also within Chinese territory, are attempting to secede from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that have broken out in France
Street battles with the police, gunfights, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that have broken out in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not turn into violence on the streets, urges the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades were burning, rioters were firing shotguns at the police. After serious youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
&quot;We have to be careful not to create such social tension that erupts into violence.
We have to take it seriously,&quot; he told Hanover&#39;s Neue Presse newspaper.
It is said that not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, states and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
Which does not mean only the integration of migrants.
&quot;From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we are seeing the first successes.&quot;
However, caution is still in order for now.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs were not comparable to those of France.
In recent nights, youths and police have been engaged in fierce street battles in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater integration efforts by the German government.
With regard to the unrest in France, Kolat warned against a &quot;copycat effect&quot;.
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be discussed.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is &quot;above average&quot;.
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat emphasized: &quot;We have to give the youth hope.&quot;
However, the head of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted: &quot;Still, we must be careful.&quot;
We need to &quot;quickly enable young people to enter work and education.&quot;
Meanwhile, the night remained largely quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with searchlights was flying over the area.
Authorities reported three arrests and several trash cans and cars set on fire.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 security forces have been deployed to maintain peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night riots gripped Toulouse.
The disturbances were caused by a traffic accident on Sunday in which two youths lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the public prosecutor&#39;s office, the police are not to blame for the death of the juveniles.
In Angela&#39;s Realm &quot;The Clouds&quot;
The chancellor&#39;s far-from-reality output documents that the coalition is programmatically at an end and that we cannot expect anything more from her.
What country does this chancellor actually live in?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and content-poor performance at the general debate of the Bundestag, we have to state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, administer.
Angela Merkel responded to the reproach that she is concentrating too much on foreign policy with one very arrogant sentence.
That&#39;s provincial, she said, showing that she didn&#39;t want to understand what the critics were getting at.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved the reproach.
There was not even a real interest from Merkel, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela &quot;Oblaková&quot; presented herself: a politician who stands out above the rest, who flees into foreign politics and even there she expresses herself only vaguely.
So, for example, climate protection: they are constantly praising the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but they are no longer saying how the given climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And in general, such self-praise - so much immodesty the CDU chairwoman would have forgiven herself just two years ago.
Now she is limited to empty phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, she damages her image as a pragmatist who does not need flattery because she solves problems.
But in the realm of Angela &quot;The Clouds&quot;, internal political problems are a marginal issue.
Child poverty and low-wage concerns?
She had a few secondary sentences left on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel argues when it comes to child benefits.
Three times, Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to manage to say at least a partially correct sentence.
As soon as things get too specific, he stumbles as if in completely foreign terrain.
Attack Department
A Republican presidential candidate debate on YouTube has erupted into a heated debate in the case of front-runners Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and now both have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his rival Rudy Guiliani of making New York a &quot;sanctuary for illegal immigrants&quot;.
Giuliani is quick to respond with sharp rebuke: &quot;I believe his own house was just one such sanctuary,&quot; he replies, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates go on the offensive. With the Republican base still without a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos, recorded by Internet users and sent via Youtube, serve only as hints of the key topic.
&quot;It is precisely this policy of isolationism that allowed Hitler to seize power,&quot; John McCain throws to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one pushing for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain does not spare Romney with his reproaches, for refusing to condemn the torturous interrogation method called &quot;Waterboarding&quot;, during which heating is simulated.
Audience reaction in Florida&#39;s St. Petersburg shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience erupts into applause whenever conservative values are extolled and future tax increases are dismissed.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
&quot;I was wrong back then,&quot; Romney explains ruefully, asking the party base and television audiences for forgiveness for having been pro-abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is ruling in civilian clothes for the first time
A day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistan&#39;s ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan&#39;s President Pervez Musharraf took the presidential oath on Thursday, and will remain in office for the next five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, particularly from the US.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after he is sworn in, thus fulfilling another of the West&#39;s demands.
The country&#39;s Supreme Court, which Musharraf filled with lawyers sympathetic to him after declaring a state of emergency in early November, last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal region.
A military spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock return
The famous German group of the seventies is playing again. The three members of Harmonia took up their electronic synthesizers again at the concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a compilation from the band&#39;s most successful period.
Even back then, they were significantly better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the appearance of three settled gentlemen who at first look like they are just enjoying their dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
The 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is bent intently over the synthesizers, is on the right from the audience&#39;s point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, surely by mistake, a traditional composition will emerge from them.
The gentlemen musicians don&#39;t seem to mind too much.
Among krautrock lovers, the revival of the band Harmonia caused quite a stir.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective consciousness of pop, but it is certainly not well-known enough for someone to miss this band painfully for twenty-three years.
But why can&#39;t a German also celebrate his still-living legends from the seventies?
And especially when the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, is valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne group Can with the Echo Lifetime Achievement Award, the hall was full of questioning looks from German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! during their speech, the astonishment of the audience knew no bounds.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloads the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even then they did not have nearly as much influence as others attributed to them later.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement of Berlin&#39;s Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramophone company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but gained fame only as a guitarist for Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to labor as a nanny.
It was rather a life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is said to be derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in a trash can.
Much of it was preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called &quot;Hudba od Harmonie&quot; and the following &quot;De Luxe&quot;.
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting roaches was not only for self-knowledge.
The now-released CD &quot;Live 1974&quot; was said to have been cut in front of a record-small, barely fifty-member stage at the concert in Griesse.
At the time, Rothera expressed a desire for the members of Harmony to goof off and practice occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebius, it was a completely rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album &quot;Burning Heart&quot;.
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Grönland aims to preserve krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli&#39;s solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in Berlin&#39;s House of World Cultures.
Performances within the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The Brit, Julian Cope, old punk and author of the &quot;Krautrock Sampler&quot; manual will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
With this, we outlined the overall breadth of krautrock&#39;s influence on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno&#39;s phrase, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: &quot;The unique true music, the future belongs to it.&quot;
There are pictures of the producer with Harmonia in a peasant meeting.
The projection of other black-and-white photos, in which the set of devices is wildly connected by cables, also contributes to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are busy improvising again.
No more sticking microphones on organs and drums to coax those never-before-heard self-made notes out of the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three meticulous people immersed in technology.
The choir of the House of World Cultures does not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, there are whispers under the clouds of sound and, in one beautiful place, an emphatic &quot;Aaaaaaaa!&quot;
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Rather than blues, we would find the roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts &quot;&#39;68!&quot; at this point isn&#39;t so far from the truth, but Harmonia isn&#39;t going to be swayed even now.
Even the most obvious things are thoroughly thought out on stage.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question either unnerves a person or allows them to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn&#39;t cynical enough
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, there were two films about the war in the Balkans.
But neither of them is convincing.
The design of the films either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too emotional.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can prevent that in The Hunting Party.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately we&#39;ve lost sight of this most handsome man of the 80s, not only because he&#39;s been in a lot of cute, frivolous roles in easy-going women&#39;s movies, but coupled with his perpetually Buddhism-themed press conferences, it makes one want to see another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party (Why do movie titles have to be so long and convoluted these days?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially what Gere might have become if fate and the film industry hadn&#39;t been so kind: a man whose prime years are long behind him, but who, as a wreck-like monument, still retains a certain remarkable charm .
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also hits theaters this week, is just the continuation of an endless string of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
We can make a short trial with the movie Mörderischer Frieden: This movie is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovar sniper, after which one of them falls in love with her.
While it&#39;s commendable that the Serbs aren&#39;t presented as the cause of all evil here, this television-shallow film turns into gunplay and action too soon.
Something very similar to the series Kobra 11 will remain from the film, albeit without the highway, but with war instead.
In the film The Hunting Party, one can clearly examine why a really good film about the Balkan War has not yet been made.
The story of three American war reporters who go after &quot;the fox&quot;, a Serbian war criminal in charge, could possibly become a new &quot;Apocalypse&quot; in a different time and under the guidance of a different director and screenwriter (here both are Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft also prescribes him a romantic affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who was later murdered.
We can finally write off The Hunting Party after the reporters succeed in the last five sped-up minutes of the film what NATO, the CIA and all the world&#39;s criminal hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch the criminal and leave him to the righteous vengeance of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
At the same time, this film has a deeply human message.
It condemns that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (they are exceptionally united here) of not pursuing the prosecution intensively enough based on secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, the famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
In it, it is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer&#39;s desk: &quot;I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, remarking: how hard it is to be evil.&quot;.
Films like The Hunting Party feature just such swollen heads, but they show how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the topic of war in the Balkans.
Recently this newspaper reported that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were big failures.
There is only one thing to add to this: There has never been a good film about South Africa.
It is almost always true: When a star wanders through a crisis zone or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Breaking Edge with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio is created.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler&#39;s List.
Much of the film apparently needs to mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse&quot; or &quot;The Lead Vest&quot; - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces back then.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder appears on two screens at home, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then screenwriters don&#39;t have the ability to flawlessly tell good stories.
After all, &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; or &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don&#39;t want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe he needs to develop a sarcastically measured artistic view like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel &quot;Lemprière&#39;s Dictionary&quot; and &quot;The Balkan War&quot;, he stated: &quot;The similarity is only that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.&quot;
Von Beust receives criticism for renouncing the Olympics
The mayor&#39;s withdrawal from hosting the Summer Olympics in Hamburg was met with sharp criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of water games.
But Von Beust encourages realism in estimating the chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called the decision &quot;unfortunate from a business perspective&quot; on Wednesday.
No other project in recent times has awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
&quot;Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sports-political enthusiasm at such a high level.&quot;
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it &quot;based on a changed timeline.&quot;
Mayor Ole von Beust stood by his earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg&#39;s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
&quot;Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy,&quot; von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Association will decide on Munich&#39;s candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
&quot;This preference means to us that we have no realistic chance with a timetable of 2028.&quot;
Still, that dream isn&#39;t over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) described von Beust&#39;s statements as regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to bid for the organization of the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
&quot;It is still too early to ruin the chance by marking the plans as buried at this early stage,&quot; HSB president Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Renouncing the application would contradict the testimony of the head of the senate, which he delivered at the general meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg&#39;s candidacy for the Universiade in 2015 as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association nominated Hamburg as a candidate city only last week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate criticized that it was wasting valuable time that could be used for the construction of apartments in Hamburg.
&quot;The development of the Klein Grasbrook area was hindered by the Senate for years because it bet on hosting the Olympics and excluded the construction of apartments,&quot; said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD still planned the Olympics for the Klein Grasbrook area, with the idea that the entire area would later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the &quot;Olympic factor&quot;.
Bidding for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused a lot of excitement in Hamburg at the time.
But Hamburg crashed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol boxes
Those who think of Sweden and wooden crates don&#39;t think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or yes?
Wooden crates currently produced in Sweden cast a dark shadow over the list of Warhol&#39;s works.
Most of his listed ninety-four Stockholm-type &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol&#39;s &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; from 1968 a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disillusionment; the six &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; donated to Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most of the other &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; of the Stockholm type that are in circulation on the international art market.
The preceding events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-blue-and-white design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 displayed - with Warhol&#39;s approval - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were supplied directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 for several wooden Brillo boxes to be made in Sweden, but they are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of that time are now talking about fifteen boxes, which rightly went down in art and auction history at the time as authorized originals - &quot;Andy Warhol&#39;s Brillo Boxes&quot; labeled Typ Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than 100,000 dollars.
The problem now is that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that approximately one hundred crates were made and displayed in Sweden in 1968 and then left to him by Warhol.
In fact, 105 Hultén crates were made in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg as recently as 1990.
At that time, Warhol was already three years after his death.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator of the Moderna Museet, examined, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood tops were painted with a base color and sanded, they were painted with white oil paint with a brush.
From the structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, it became clear that the paint was applied with a painter&#39;s roller directly to the plywood board without a previous primer - besides, it is an acrylic paint and not an oil paint.
&quot;These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol&#39;s official list of Brillo boxes,&quot; said Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: &quot;Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York comes to different conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to six to classify boxes from their exhibition collections as &quot;exhibition material - copies&quot;.
Back in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into these &quot;major allegations&quot; made in the case of the soap powder boxes.
But the organization still remains inexorably silent.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Rebel chief Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the president of election manipulation and corruption, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government earlier attacked the hotel with tear gas.
Several hours before, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for the failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the meeting to flee with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to be guarding him apparently defected to his side and joined the mutiny.
They stormed the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Units loyal to the government closed off the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers&#39; action.
&quot;People have had enough,&quot; Triallnes said.
&quot;We encourage people to join us.&quot;
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march shortly.
Critics of the government called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Her government has been accused of corruption for months.
As early as 2003, Manila&#39;s financial district became the main scene of a revolt by about 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellion collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet secured a more than twenty percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company is said to now own 20.05% of the share capital.
There had been speculation about a takeover before.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet announced that with this move it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%, there was speculation about an entry on Wednesday.
It is said in the financial market that this financial institution only holds shares for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet already had an almost 10% stake in the company Drillisch, which is a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put up for sale an additional 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL and mobile network products.
&quot;We are strengthening our partnership,&quot; explained a United Internet spokesperson.
In order to take over rival Freenet, the companies have joined together to form a joint venture, MSP.
United Internet announced on Thursday that the two companies will settle for a stake of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and will not exercise their right to take an additional 18.49% of the business.
The companies are understood to be keeping all options open for now, particularly the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet regarding a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and hardly transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile customers and 1.27 million customers with full or DSL connections at the end of the third quarter.
Holding United Internet and Drillische has so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it is said that it has been agreed that Drillisch will get approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
