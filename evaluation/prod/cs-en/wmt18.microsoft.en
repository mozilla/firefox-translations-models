Civil Rights Movement Issues Travel Alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of People of Color (NAACP) has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missouri residents to exercise increased attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of contentious racially motivated incidents currently occurring across the state," the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it made the move under current Missouri laws that make it more difficult to defend racist acts in court, as well as law enforcement actions that disproportionately target minorities.
"There are violations of civil rights.
People are stopped by police officers just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," Rod Chapel, NAACP president for Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
"We are accumulating the largest number of complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for a U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and police remanded him in custody without criminal charges.
The travel advisory also highlights a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's Office stating that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of travel advice is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI's current hate reporting program, there were 100 cases of hate speech in Missouri in 2015, which places the state in sixteenth place among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodations or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of violations of the law, which the ACLU says is designed to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but more recently, advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family still has peace after 12 years!
The murdered is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie at the restaurant where she worked, who inflicted stab wounds on her.
The victim and the killer were said to have sex and smoke marijuana, eventually killing her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café and watched the meticulous crime work of investigating the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
In court, he admitted only assaulting a juvenile, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying in the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, were arguing on that fateful night.
The killer said: "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of taxi drivers," he claimed falsely.
According to his testimony, the girl should have defended herself as much as she could, but in vain.
Lewis stabbed her to death in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and blamed him.
After confessing, Dixie talked about his and appetite for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's house, they drank alcohol and took cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda told the Mirror.
And twelve years later, the family faces more attacks from vandals destroying their grave.
In the last six months, it has been damaged four times.
There are such cruel people at large who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," Linda, the mother of the deceased girl, told The Mirror about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of designer erotic aids Fun Factory, which caught Martin's attention, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the partner left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs the Intimity boutique in Benediktská Street in Prague, where he sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
But come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, served as the inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than what everyone here is used to.
No covered shop windows, everything done in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to approach the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It's related to intimacy, and it's also, you could say, tender," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the winner was the variant that divided the store into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, it didn't seem ideal to us because it's not on the main street, but then again, it suited the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one looks at customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that was different, with branded handsome goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel comfortable.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they entered such a business at all.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Moreover, I did not even feel like going to a shop with erotic aids.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only female staff in the store, the fact that women are not ashamed to ask for help does not mean that a man's foot would not come here.
Mostly gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't estimate the right size and choose a larger one," Martin smiles at a common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the ingrained clichés that women need some great aids, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith will choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, while women usually tend to gravitate more towards pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is such a touchless clitoral stimulator.
I struggle with an adolescent need to chuckle with admiration at the serious tone with which the explanation is given to me.
As if nothing had happened.
And it doesn't actually churn.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We did not believe that it would be so well received.
It is a kind of latest revolutionary innovation.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He ensured that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe couples vibrator.
He has completely broken the taboo that may persist for some men, namely that they see competition in erotic aids.
"Different variations are being made," he continues.
With one motor, with two motors, with remote control.
This is a popular category.
During a love union, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of feeding vibrators.
At least in our country.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they only use it externally.
In Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
It would probably have to be conceived a little differently.
The question is what to offer men," Martin reflects.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience of use.
In Japan, however, it is completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought that Japanese women are very fond of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the internet reality," I am explained.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and taboo for women." Just for the record, what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are quite an accommodating nation.
Certainly unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has some experience with both sex life and some aids.
She will come for something nice, of better quality, to complement her partner life, or for herself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of its return by making sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to get into specialties such as bondage and latex, because we do not have the space for it, and it does not really fit here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
These are people who have always been shy about going to a sex shop because they were afraid that something like this would peek at them.
A lot of the products on display on the shelves are really appealing.
This is also due to the selection of reputable brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever winner was the aforementioned seahorse "and that triggered a change in the industry.
They began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with harmless ones, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that some of them were designed by a Czech, namely the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy the Whoop.de.doo design stuff from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls from Anna Marešová.
She has done a really huge job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it is not a mass production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than large series.
Maybe I'm going a bit against the tide, but it seems important to me to keep the development here in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation to me, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or negative attitude.
At most, people are embarrassed.
"But then they start smiling, too." Currently, Anna Marešová offers a vibrator for which you can have a personal message made, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other innovations should be added.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I'm interested in where the boundaries of what's okay lie.
Is there anything Martin Ráž would not sell?
It's terribly hard to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we rather define ourselves by the assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them venture into any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write to her that unfortunately we don't have anything like that.
It's still a question of whether someone was making fun of us," Martin looks at me suspiciously.
This also happens from time to time...
A blow for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Štědrý is fighting a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is fighting an illness that steals all people's memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true," the singer himself confirmed the sad information to Blesk.
I know about my illness and so far I am coping with it due to the circumstances.
"I take medication to slow down the concomitant phenomena of the disease," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make life easier for Charles.
His wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, her daughters from his first marriage Zuzana and Tereza also commute to visit her father at the house in Bílá Hora, and their son Karel called Karlas takes care of her.
Štědrý twice battled cancer and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has had sixty chemotherapy sessions.
He was able to get back to work after them, as well as to the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I have a prediction from the astrologer that I will be here until ninety," Karel told Blesk.
He's a fighter.
He still longs to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The actress Květa Fialová is now fighting the same disease in the institute.
Do you have a family history patient with Alzheimer's?
See how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be considered by the Central Committee.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be performed even for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
Chile's Constitutional Court has ten members and is expected to receive a new president by the end of August, who AFP says is close to the opposition.
A law repealing an absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court because, according to them, it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
MPs postponed voting on the bill last month until it was analysed by a mixed parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, deputies approved the bill, after which the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislation, abortion should cease to be punishable in three cases: if the woman's life is in danger, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
An absolute ban on abortion was imposed in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world with an absolute ban on abortion.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are currently about 20 women behind bars serving up to thirty years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights activists, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court ruled to be murder.
Is there anything sacred at all?
The target of the Trump White House is now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is criticism of statues.
Americans could tell about it as well as anyone else - witness the carefully staged toppling of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, must have known what was about to happen when, during a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over the president's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty imitators.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, only 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... A symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal afterwards, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is factually right, but as he put it, this is not about history.
These are above all the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today: she invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let him come to me, who falls, who is poor, who is barely allowed to breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these "miserable worms" on our screens.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry—he wanted to make it clear that these people weren't welcome in the U.S.
This conflict over the statue's meaning is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it's essentially a conflict over America's meaning.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to place a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing the classical theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus altered this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Merging the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Well-known Rush Limbaugh commentator — John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power — argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty doesn't actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to a backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the road to the United States."
Oddly enough, Limbaugh stumbles upon an important point.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned traveler who often arrives in a new country with hope in his heart after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the sculpture expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to stir up hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Championships in Athletics: Neil Black sings the praises of the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK athletics director Neil Black said a strong squad of 16 Scots in a World Championships squad would be a "huge asset to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Championships in London, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes there is "something special going on" in Scotland and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand it and adapt — we're going to work on it," Black said.
"I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will be vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scottish or non-Scottish, came out of the room feeling great pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke was unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record set in 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Middle-distance runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
At the World Championships, he will compete in the 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m, winning the British Team Races and the Anniversary Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member of the team.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only did a large number of her female teammates make it to the team, but in many cases they will also be attacking for finals and medals.
"What is extraordinary about being team captain is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honour for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is all the more gratifying," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who made it into the team.
It proves how far we have come.
These are the athletes who will be thinking about the top places on the podium.
And my introductory speech?
Yes, I think it worked.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance to race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us—and the stupid and dumb will be led like sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on starting to act like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for these acts.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and many "who cares" sentiments appeared in comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an immensely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest approval rating of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irritable.
As can be seen, he runs his state with his own certainty and strictly adheres to the principles.
He also turns out to be adept at using Facebook as the main means of connecting with his constituents — posting his first bald head photo after chemotherapy is no exception.
Blocking people who visit the governor's page — which is a public forum marked as official and maintained by his employees paid for by taxpayers' money — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying the blocking of comments was done from a position of moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of internet trolls, spammers, or angry people.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people speaking to their elected leaders; Teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As they all stated, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi attorney Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I have politely noted that I am disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the Washington Post.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" would probably be called "advocacy" by others.
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would have required sending employees into the streets to collect and burn all copies of criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria by barring an elector from her Facebook page, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
In Washington's time, low shipping costs had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have been piling up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And a true leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
They are most often in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse the web, and they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi under a parasol.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
These are the results of recent statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available as part of a flat rate than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where only a minimum of our visitors go during the winter, data consumption has increased fifty-fold this summer season.
Italy ranked second in the ranking of data consumed.
Czechs call the most minutes from Germany, where many of them go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs a year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have exchanged the book for sharing experiences using their mobile phones.
This year's record was July 7.
"The transferred data would fit tens of millions of photos," Silvia Cieslarová, director of the mobile segment at O2, said in detail.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, where we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"Moreover, Czechs are heading to the Adriatic through Austria," Cieslarová explained.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth in data after the release of roaming charges, the growth in telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates by a huge margin over other countries.
"Roaming calls are more likely to be used by business customers," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homely atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Over the next three days, former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who is originally from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales on his way to the final last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course. This year, he will serve as the tournament's ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to enjoy first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of the game and is proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
England's Eales will defend his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about it," said the Southport golfer.
"I didn't have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to golf.
I remember last year when winning meant so much to me and my wife, Sharon.
Those were beautiful times that I will never forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years earlier this year, returns to home soil.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want to do well and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I'm happy with the result so far."
The trio will also be joined on the pitch by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she's not using the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a frying pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato — a "note" in local parlance — directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and enjoys it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the house is not furnished - where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes in the turbid water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof substitutes a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no field was assigned to her to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late into the night is a danger: most of the villagers are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers reside in the village.
"In the afternoon after five o'clock, no one dares to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It's a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by public raising their hands in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and ravaged city that you can reach after a ninety-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach-clenching drive.
Public transport does not work in this place.
The town of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, woolen roofs in shades of grey and rust.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners have visited this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and shiny skirt.
"Previously, we only carried leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and its infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But at the same time, it is Indonesia's land of gold.
Grasberg, the world's largest and highest-grossing gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, USA, is located just 60 miles from Paniai — a rocky province about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 investigation by the New York Times found that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
Mass murders in the tribal region of Papua during the 70s of the last century amounted to genocide, as stated by the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year as extrajudicial killings, torture — rape and electrocutions are particularly popular, according to another report — and the brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
"It's difficult to count the number of casualties because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan sources were attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% are Christian, but the demographics have changed with the influx of Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixture of vegetables and peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to survive.
"Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"The indigenous people of Papua — mama-mama (women) — have lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to tackle inequality and rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would answer our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi's inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs around a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the rebuke and the tone it was spoken and later returned with four other soldiers, said local parish priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the drunken soldiers chased a group of children and beat them with the butts of their weapons, victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby election commission building, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - which runs in a circle and imitates the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe of me Pago.
Several protesters began throwing stones at the buildings.
As tensions escalated, the soldiers were ordered over the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," the official document, the contents of which were never published in local media, said, according to TIME.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the impending danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one heeded his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden home.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME in a gloomy voice.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely "secure" the station, which was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," Papuan police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
Human Rights Watch said five protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the murders rummaged through the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura expressing his sympathy for the victims' families and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be heard.
"Most of the acts of violence happened a long time ago.
Some of them happened in the 90s of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
But in a June 5 interview with TIME weekly in Jakarta, Wiranto said he had no plans to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will go to court."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during independent elections in East Timor in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting greeted his claim with disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but so far I haven't gotten anything," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
A few years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by members of the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The brawl, in which one person died and 17 others were injured, occurred between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting the unconscious man to hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's building.
According to police, villagers threw stones at the officers and were answered with warning gunfire.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retribution," Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
"I haven't left the house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament demanded that the police officers involved be punished and the mobile brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the Indonesian government's side.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. These include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among Papuans as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty adds fuel to the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
Locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; Each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the needs of the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potato cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to pour into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to start a business.
"Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they had been given such rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia office, Jokowi campaigned on promises to lift strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the recalcitrant easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia over Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta that: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Human Rights Envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people chanted "we want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Another election is scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a well-intentioned person, but he is surrounded by people associated with the Paniai shooting," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai — in addition to living in constant fear of a marauding army — wallow in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote a "debt" that Jokowi must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite threats and intimidation by the families of the victims of the Panai shooting, they continue in a final symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done, at least he will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
During the intervention, the four-member crew of the ship, which apparently consists of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, set sail from South America and was towed by police to a port in Nouméa, the capital of France's overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
Australia's intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to pinpoint where the drugs were coming from and where they were going, and to uncover a "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop the large quantities of drugs heading to Australia," said Col Blanch, chief executive officer.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumee this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for drug traffickers due to high street drug prices.
The country is also faced with the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current crackdown is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia that they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be infusions of saline, which are pricked with a thin needle under the skin.
However, these are currently applied only in medical facilities.
The older a person gets, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"On top of that, they lose their sense of thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," Mádlová said.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she says, no doctor often monitors this.
In hospitals, dehydration is routinely treated with infusions.
"I think even there should be a gradual introduction so that they can get subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of saline can be delivered to the elderly per day.
Lack of fluid can cause malaise, headache and decreased performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," she added.
If neglected, it can result in stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, there is also a threat of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, maximally with a cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It is more demanding in terms of nursing, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin ventilate," the doctor said.
The Torch burned for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers went up in flames on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire in the last two years at this high-rise building, which is aptly named The Torch.
All occupants of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We were asleep and we were woken up by an alarm. We heard screaming.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, a skyscraper resident, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defence said firefighters managed to bring the fire under control around four a.m. (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they were providing alternative accommodation for affected residents.
The incident could reignite a debate about the safety of materials used to cladding high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by Torch skyscraper management after a fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged were the cladding and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the blaze in the June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carry prohibited items on board an aircraft
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they have belatedly discovered that they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1,000 respondents responded - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly attempting to travel with an item that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flight hours, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of the TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men surveyed also admitted to intentionally smuggling banned drugs on board.
The airline said it conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally smuggled unauthorized items through airport security and how many did so on purpose.
Not surprisingly, most people who have carried illicit items – whether knowingly or unknowingly – travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA's directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and in what quantities they can carry onto the plane.
So it's no surprise that the TSA seized the largest amount of the currently banned liquid.
For a time, people thought the TSA would treat books the same way as contraband.
Carrying liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponing planned emissions reduction guidelines by the Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chairman, Scott Pruitt, retracted his earlier decision to delay implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes as part of his plan. It responds more swiftly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
But he made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeals.
This concerns the latest deadline, which has been set for 1 October, when countries should start complying with the 2015 regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or threatened economic growth."
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma's attorney general before President Donald Trump was appointed EPA chief, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, D.C., Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt reversal is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executor had exceeded his authority in trying to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration's plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane spills.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to working with nations through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the previous EPA administration, it often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We don't believe in litigation regulation and we take meeting the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it."
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt could use "the delay option and all other legally available authorities" at some point to ensure that regulations "are based on sound policy and the most available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measures still haven't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal — following our lawsuit — is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcome Pruitt's sudden change.
"It's worrying what pressure needs to be put into changing the mindset of those responsible and protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burda of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to wrestle with the Trump administration's ideological crusade to aid polluters and special interests."
He doused the man with acid, yet he is not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment you're at home with your family and you're laughing, the next your whole life suddenly changes from the ground up.
And the worst thing is that you can not do anything about it at all.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, there was a knock on the Christopheros' door.
Andreas got up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
Without warning, the man, whom he had never seen in his life, poured acid on him as soon as he opened it, saying, "This is for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I just felt an incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there his loved ones learned terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
For several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was affected, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A big complication for Christopheros was the loss of his eyelids.
It's probably the most torturous thing I've experienced.
"You can't hide from an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his ordeal.
Today, Christopheros has had twelve surgeries, which are far from the last.
The injuries sustained by victims of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victim has tissues scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and struggle with deformation and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused a loved one.
The police duly investigated the case and later tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict changed fundamentally, to the amazement of Christopheros' family.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be overturned as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the numbers of corrosive substances have increased considerably.
The country's Interior Ministry said it plans to set new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosive substances.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks are not going to give up.
They demand that the UK government enforce tougher and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tighter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops because they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the occupants of the eighty-storey building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the other way around.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Another tenant quoted by Reuters said the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downwards with glowing debris falling.
We slept.
We were woken up by the alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," tenant George said.
Another witness told CNN that the flames engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, the fire was brought under control, according to the Civil Defense statement.
The cause of its occurrence is not yet known.
According to witnesses, power went out in nearby buildings.
A massive fire also damaged Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one was hurt, as the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and became the tallest residential building in the world with its 352 meters.
Another Dubai skyscraper robbed him of the record the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, the twenty-three-year-old Ippolito's sample contained a diverse collection of illicit devices - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year suspension and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record number for athletes caught until then.
The third-league player said he had started taking steroids a year earlier when he fell in love with bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-lover!
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková set foot in the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was then 12 years older and already longed for a family.
Lucie was only 19 years old at the time and certainly had no desire to hang up her career.
So they went apart, but they have remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the press conference of TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both matched to the blue color.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal's pranks until she grabbed her stomach.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for photographers.
However, their meeting was no coincidence, as they will play a couple together in Prima's new series Captain Exner.
Islamists were given life sentences in the UK for plotting an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell calling itself the Three Musketeers to life in prison and was planning a terrorist attack against police and the military, according to prosecutors.
The four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar offences, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities thought he was going to attack imminently.
In one of the men's car, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "infidels" in Arabic, and a dummy pistol.
This happened when an MI5 secret service agent was placing a listening device in the car.
"The recent attacks have shown the horror the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," said Sue Hemming, a deputy prosecutor.
Three convicts, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for release after twenty years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after just 15 years behind bars.
The men pleaded not guilty during the trial in London and that the weapons found in the car had been placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard from him, but then dismissed the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In the Hodonín region, they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, it was surpassed by Thursday, which became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equalled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring more than 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
In Strážnice, for example, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as at Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the hottest was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures there only started to rise later this afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to CHMI, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
China has been trying for decades to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends ten billion dollars annually to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing to do so.
The country's state media are talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
But arrivals rose by just 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is partly due to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, Christopher Balding, an economics professor at Peking University, assesses the situation in the world's most populous country in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel to China, while the others must obtain visas in advance.
Therefore, in the Chinese authorities in the US, the crowds are comparable to the celebration of the Chinese New Year.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait in line for hours, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a given country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and less than one percent of the total population.
China often exacerbates this problem itself, using tourism to further its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a spat over South Korea's missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, up to $190 billion may have left China as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China earns about $35 billion annually from selling the currency to incoming tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, China had a tourism deficit of $217 billion last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's total surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, the small number of tourists is dealing a very painful blow to a country that is anxious to prevent capital flight.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general reticence towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
As recently as 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived in all of China.
Some individual cities in the United States have more.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads for immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants tend to revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
However, you will practically not find them in China.
Resolving these problems will be politically challenging, but the obvious step is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and make visa procedures cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo they bred deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters above sea level.
"It grows up to a meter in length," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba said.
The young of the other two species, the death eaters and the red cobra, will still gain strength in the garden's breeding facilities.
We can't say yet when people will see them.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian viper death-eaters were born, descendants of a breeding pair originally from the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the death eaters from the Perth area," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, it is necessary for the death eater to winterize for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success accompanied a bunch of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen Zoo hatched a total of four chicks from four eggs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of up to four meters.
It is aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse barflies in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect hatching of chicks from the clutch of black mamba, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone call, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for a border wall
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a Jan. 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president reproached him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, reportedly saying: "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and claimed that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been leaked, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance agreement on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal — which came under President Obama — he would look "drugged" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk again testified at the prosecutor's office over Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," said Jaroslaw Kaczyński, the dead president's brother, chairman of the ruling PiS party.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk said, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to abuse the judiciary against political rivals.
As he left the prosecutor's office, a crowd chanting Donald Tusk was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24! and wished the politician One Hundred Years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he has a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He says he does not reproach the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was interrogated for the second time.
The former prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation was supposed to concern errors in autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
Additionally, it was discovered that the bodies in the coffins were replaced.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of a scandal, because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński claimed on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński said that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons for questioning as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The Public Prosecution Service in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who fulfils the role of Prosecutor General.
The summons for questioning came soon after Tusk's election as head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
This follows from the decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update of it, it is currently in the comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for deputies abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explains its approach.
"In some countries, new embassies have been created, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed," the material says.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies to which paper ballot papers are supplied.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a press version of their ballots.
It is their list that is changed by the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or in Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia and Kyoto, Japan.
Voting will also not take place at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar, Senegal, and Lusaka in Zambia are newly on the list.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
Ballots will also be available for registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose deputies at polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission draws lots for the region whose candidates are being voted on abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the decision was made between South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs abroad voted among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6700, four years later 8222.
For the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters turned out for embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: activists commemorate racist lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past onlookers in Monroe, Georgia and strolled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group—a middle-aged man in a striped suit—took a long drag from his cigarette and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside, passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n---and Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence is broken by the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct that fateful night in 1946 when two black couples—Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey—were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has yet been tried for the murders.
"It's surprising that in all these years not a single person has been arrested – even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of an event represents a dramatic challenge to action. Every year, he reminds the Monroe community that justice has not been done.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin."
On July 27, 1946, a forensic doctor covers one of the bodies of victims of the Moore's Ford lynching.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were believed to have participated in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the suspects remaining free for decades, civil rights advocates say both reasons for the lynching — politics and sex — were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision gave black Georgians the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
It was during the summer election, according to the FBI, that black farmer Roger Malcom allegedly stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester during a scuffle — allegedly on behalf of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was rumored in the town that Hester had sex with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and had brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, then a prominent white landowner, posted $600 bail for Malcom.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turns out, Harrison planned and organized the murders," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks was more succinct.
"It was a massacre for the franchise," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext to all local black residents: 'this is what you end up if you register and vote.'"
Cassandra Greene has been organizing the annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event for nearly a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise. It shows a deep-rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching because we have to deal with the discomfort that lurks in all of us," Greene said.
"But there can't be a relationship between us unless you listen to what I've had to go through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the first day some 30 actors—a dozen whites, the rest black—crowded into the room where Greene introduced them to a carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
He played the leader of the Ku Klux Klan for many years, but says the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to remember that part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the roles of Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, respectively, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcom argues with Hester and accuses him of sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my property n---e!"
Rascona can not.
There is a skirmish.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" he asks Rascona.
He is confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene replies cheerfully.
"I just don't think whites said 'n--r' in that tone back then."
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts out.
"You need to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; Hostility will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the performance to be authentic. If only to make enough for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronouncing of the word N.
Now no one laughs.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Roar, gunshots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is a sense of sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of all this, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are practically equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple traveled all the way from Ithaca, New York, and many of the onlookers are from the vicinity.
Each endures the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a line to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until now, the murders could have been viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunted.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites the crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel to the heads of the victims, watch the fake blood and motionless bodies, and whisper something in each other's ears.
"They're not dead," says the little boy.
A few minutes pass, and Greene thanks the audience. It's over.
The actors clean the rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who plays the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actor friends and cries in their arms; Eventually, emotions hit him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know you hate the role.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talk passionately about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find the words to express her feelings about today's performance.
"It's difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those ugly deeds... done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a hot topic," she added, "it's just called police skirmishes."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom. He enjoys his dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the performance for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it is also a moment for reflection," he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... It could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instruction manuals.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads the instruction manuals.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember times long past, where instructions for the use of anything were rather a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first turntable contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphs depicting the wiring of some components, all of which had some secret marks.
When, years later, something inside went wrong, I offered the document to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a smirk, he told me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was a common tool for chronic toilet paper depletion.
He easily found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl badges again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where you simply held on to the cut grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
Especially successful was the sketch describing how to insert one part into another.
The kit was two-piece, and any other procedure was simply not possible.
Putting it the other way around required considerable effort, with the need to break off certain plastic parts.
My disdain for instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, replacing the bulb blinker.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the bulb on the right could be replaced really only in three steps.
1. Remove the cover.
2. Unscrew the cracked bulb and screw in a new one.
3. Slide the cover on.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car, I would find a spring, a screw, which I could easily remove the cover and then I would follow points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
Footbridge error.
The cover had no room, no room even for Cinderella's slender hand, let alone the obese Silesian.
I lost half an hour of my life without any success at all.
The condition was further enhanced by the entrance of my wife into the garage, who was summoned by the noise and words that she hears from my lips quite rarely.
"What are you doing here?" she asked guilelessly.
My response lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked, a sentence that may be her last in a long-running volume.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the process of torture of the author of the manual, where blessing her with a hot iron on the hand that wrote the manual, then cutting her off so that he could never write anything again, was only an introduction to a wide range of instructions of the Witch Hammer, including his commission burning on the hill above the Losiny castle.
"How about removing the box?" the woman said of removing the battery.
In sheer desperation, it happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that was until the day I received a call from a colleague who was just emerging from a state of collapse after checking two female officials of the State Drug Control Unit.
I know him as a colleague of the balanced, who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can tell wild stories in an unexcited voice.
"Imagine I got fined for not having posted instructions for washing my hands," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I extracted the whole problem from it, which was that above the sink in the toilet of patients does not have picture instructions on how to wash their hands.
His argument to the commission official that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing soapy palms with running water was a primitive act on the level of a Cro-Magnon, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
For example, it is necessary to say that it is necessary to turn on the water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is joyful to find out that you have washed your hands exactly as the hosudar from SÚKL orders him.
Finally, I have to say that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, for urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to post two instructions.
The pictograms remain a problem, because creating a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could cause a certain outrage in a prudish toilet visitor, despite the fact that he may finally learn that he has been wiping the hole in question with a completely wrong procedure all his life.
Pearson to lay off 3,000 more employees and cut dividend in an effort to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off another 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program aimed at changing the business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which CEO John Fallon said will occur in late 2018 and early 2019, follows the company's previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting programme in a bid to resurrect declining business as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a 1 per cent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul. One NATO soldier was killed and several others wounded in the attack, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the Qarabagh district.
A bomb attack hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's blast occurred after a patrol along with members of the Afghan army was attacked by "a local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement said all the injured soldiers were not in danger of dying and were in a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to correspondents, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a significant source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia neighborhood.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people. It is the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. forces overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to help troops and police in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks in recent weeks have shaken the public's confidence in the government, its orders and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay an Obama administration law that ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to refer the "2015 Ozone Standards" on Wednesday night, saying it was presenting the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with our national partners and will listen to their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an effort by the EPA to delay ozone standards — which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and use measurements to determine limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen from most Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday arguing that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to block many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama — in an effort to spur economic growth, Trump said.
But the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár was hit and blood flowed!
You may have already noticed this relatively new singer in June this year, when this hitherto almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in the Czech Republic, where he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show the public and present his music video for the song Sara, whose christening was performed by the above-mentioned personalities.
Few people know, however, that the actual shooting of the video clip, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it was not without a real embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramatic nature of the scene, the singer's rival was supposed to indicate a slap blow in the video.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, blood immediately came out of my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the set that it was an unfortunate coincidence and Ladislav did not manage to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the continuation of the filming.
We now bring you the mentioned video clip of the young artist, you can also record the scene with the punch.
The failed version with blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discussed the possibilities of a duel at the meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting featherweight boxing match, met for the first time at Tuesday's meeting.
Each was in a separate room in ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia — the undefeated World Boxing Council featherweight champion — came down to the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime bout, both boxers made it to the list of the top five featherweight boxers.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers, and Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, adds that a potential boxer fight would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia added.
"Because of the fight with Broner (67kg) I had to gain weight, but I'm not that big.
For my 63 kg I am small.
I would like to return to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to put on weight to get light... Then we can compete.
That's what the fans want.
Why not fulfill it."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would benefit from this fight."
Klimas has made a request for payment per view – which is part of its strategy. Lomachenko is expected to make his featherweight debut later this year and face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next year, who has also expressed interest in a fight against the winner of the Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell duel, who will fight for the featherweight title at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The match should be a pay-per-watch approach, that's what the fans want," said Garcia, who later said he was open to broadcasting the match through the TV channel that came up with the best offer.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will attract such attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was not lulled by Garcia's praise, saying the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt the tension rising ahead of their duel.
"You won't forget this game.
No other match attracts so much attention.
And I will take great pleasure in stoking the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great match."
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search was launched for them, but without success.
And the police eventually dropped the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not learn what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years came the sad ending of the whole story.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvash.
It was only thanks to the documents left in the car that the police managed to identify the couple.
The papers survived a decade underwater, without them it would have taken police much longer to identify those found.
The couple were last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a icy road along the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing, after which more details will be published.
Latest test results to determine the age of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people surveyed were over the age of 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting the new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately when evaluating asylum applications. The measure came after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency concluded that the interviewee was "possibly over 18 years of age."
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was "possibly under 18 years of age".
Tests are only taken if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson from the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are in business as usual and the numbers are very similar," he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, "the interviewee was found to be 18 years of age or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical age-determination method, which includes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then reviewed by dentists and radiologists, has also received criticism.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which the person went through puberty.
"I've had reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of age measurements are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine age with precision, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," he told Metro newspaper.
Forensic medical agency Agency's GÃ¶ransson defended the decision, saying: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the interviewee is just under 18 years of age, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico over the phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would be arranged somehow, though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump has spoken similarly openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
That's according to transcripts of interviews published Thursday by The Washington Post.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first conversation with Mexico's president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically rebuked Peña Nieto for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He portrayed its southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressed Mexico's president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a Jan. 27 interview, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
Financing is said to be somehow figured out and in the end it will turn out well.
"But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I don't want to associate with you gentlemen anymore, because that is unacceptable to me," Trump said.
He called the wall the least important thing we talk about, but politically it is perhaps the most important.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after taking power.
Mexico refuses to build and finance the 3200-kilometer wall, which has also caused relations between the two countries to escalate.
In late March, Trump said the United States would pay for the project for the time being.
Trump eventually met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief of staff called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted to such a conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States taking in people from detention facilities in Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can certainly say this is not the deal that you made, but you're going to have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, such as when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of conversation sharpened.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump said.
I assure you that they are bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They won't be great people going to work for local milkmen," he said.
In the interview, he also noted that a refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
At the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
He ended up calling Turnbull the least pleasant of the day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In front of the crowd they executed the murderer of Rana.
Her father watched.
The execution took place in a square in Yemen's capital, Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his victim little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit the entire country, which is facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a crowd of thousands who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after the execution.
I feel like reborn.
I feel relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
Other family members were also present, shouting "long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was dragged out.
The officers tied him up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd present celebrated every shot that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed," he added.
I stood in Sana's Liberation Square waiting for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife, Jamileh, and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would go into a hateful frenzy, grab the murderer and lynch him.
The execution was ordered by a court ruled by the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his action aroused such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that Rana's body bore were horrific," he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that same day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes that the police received a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of the horrific crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out to play with the other neighborhood kids.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al-Maghrabi was being held and demand immediate punishment.
A Justice Department representative read a recording of the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
The accused apparently showed no remorse for his actions.
Just before serving his sentence, the police read him the verdict, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many recordings made by the crowd appeared on the Internet.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Change
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced at President Trump's rally Thursday night that he was switching parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Justice governor said.
"Today, after much prayer and reflection, I announce to you... Today, as a resident of West Virginia, I tell you that I can no longer support you as Democratic governor."
The crowd of onlookers erupted in joy.
"Tomorrow I will join the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the entire country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
His assets are estimated to be worth $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "The defection of the governor of Justice is yet another blow to the Democratic Party that is putting obstacles in our way instead of working to uplift our country."
"For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislatures in history, the Justice Governor's announcement is the last straw for an already miserable, leaderless party that is struggling in vain to find a positive and unifying message," RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises 'sincere' apology from Russia over doping scandal
Former eminent athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology over the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time has not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was the right thing to do and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized "to all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which went into effect in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think today we saw a very honest response and presentation," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working with all its strength to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today was very successful and we have progressed to the next level, but Congress supports the Crisis Management Committee's recommendation to maintain the punishment that has been inflicted on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones," he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have met the IAAF's strict rules will compete under a neutral flag.
The IAAF's chief of crisis staff, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it could be allowed back.
Drug tests are still inadequate and the excluded coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after an IAAF council presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded to the firm of František Savov, whom the state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Františka Savov.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, CzechTrade, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, announced a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract worth a total of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the Mladá fronta publishing house of entrepreneur František Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of the server Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, 60 percent of the award of the contract was to be decided by the price offered and the remaining 40 by a beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
Savov's company was greatly helped by the second criterion.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received one hundred points in all sub-quality criteria.
As a result, this put it ahead of another candidate, the publishing house Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with CZK 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received a below-average rating from the judges in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the Aktuálně.cz server, falls under the Economia publishing house.
The VLM publishing house filed several objections against the outcome of the tender, saying that its evaluation was unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
After their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition at the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The petitioner is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the public contract supplier on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the petitioner and other suppliers," reads the proposal to initiate proceedings filed at the Office for the Protection of Competition this week, published by news server Aktuálně.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be unreliable and the one hundred percent evaluation of the Mladá fronta project by all its members is extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," Klíma told Aktual.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
As a matter of principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in the Contracting Authority's Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"After the end of the contract, a complete written report will be published, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," Štěpán Dlouhý, the agency's media representative, told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house intervened in a competition with an article in Aktuálně.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in that article.
The fact that she provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years could have helped her in the tender.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
Police accuse František Savov of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking Great Britain for his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls.
A London court rejected Savov's extradition appeal last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved forward since last year, and we have not received any notification from Great Britain regarding the entry into force of the judgment to date," Prague City Prosecutor's Office spokeswoman Štěpánka Zenklová told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning Mladá fronta, Savov was a member of Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, buying distressed assets.
He should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the transfer of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker rode along the sidewalks and through the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention by recklessly driving on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to pursue him, he decided to run away in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers were chasing the man through the city with increased caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into a field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive at the accident and transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Later, the police discovered that the biker did not have a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number had been polished and the production plate itself had been removed.
It is therefore possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"A breath test ruled out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result for methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules limiting the funding of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's record-breaking move from Barcelona in Spain to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid the equivalent of €222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are several financial terms of Neymar's move to France.
Given that PSG are funded by a wealthy Qatari family that made their fortune selling energy, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his appointment as UEFA director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that went into debt in search of new signings were ultimately cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, FFP rules shifted their focus from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending exorbitant sums on players and building a global brand - was suddenly not so profitable.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can post a loss of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is determined to defend a ban on overspending.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a lump sum, it can spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to €44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi Group.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million) – which was later reduced to €20 million – and ordered to reduce their Champions League squad to 21 players in 2014-2015, instead of 25.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
UEFA took a similar measure in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
Part of Neymar's income at PSG could be covered by the organising committee of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the 2022 World Cup officials in Qatar denied that Neymat should become a World Cup ambassador and that such a manoeuvre would have been easily detected by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's insiders, UEFA has not opened any investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as he was not authorized to comment on the PSG situation, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of its biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' by the club and the state," la Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's ownership by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports mogul, shares La Liga's same stance on financing the club.
"It's the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the state becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Sparta midfielder Rosický: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický goes to the set.
The same scene as in Sunday's match against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder stirred up the game against Red Star, invented several goals, but his teammates did not head to the black.
The Letná team, pumped with new multi-million reinforcements, ends after the opening double match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do something with the match after Belgrade's goal?
After conceding a goal, four had to be scored, which was difficult for us.
We wanted at least not to lose, to raise our confidence so that we would have something to bounce back from in the next matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is terribly worked.
The opponent's combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we shot maybe once at half-time.
Of course, that's not enough when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you need to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of lineup changes?
Of course, it's one of the pains when a new squad is formed.
We've only played three competitive games and the line-up is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it encouraging for you that you've played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just parts of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise there is no other way.
It's the same with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Again, the fans came in large numbers, but left in embarrassment.
What message can you give them?
There was again an amazing visit, as well as with Bohemka.
I am terribly sorry that we cannot make them happy with a better performance.
To show something that they will come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visits like that when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so it is not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected a complaint by businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion.
The quantified damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, and that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are incomplete.
The constitutional judges, however, described the complaint as unfounded, CTK found out from the court's database.
The Constitutional Court is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess factual or legal errors allegedly committed by ordinary courts, provided that they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the Constitutional Court's decision.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage suffered.
The High Court described the case as extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was incurred in the period from January to July 2008 alone, and the total leakage, according to the expert, exceeded one billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly payments of VAT and excise duty in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, it paid taxes in mere hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company did business are related to businessman Radomír Vybíral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison by the judiciary for VAT manipulation in fuel transactions.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
The series "Summer to Unsurvive" and "Comrade Detective" strike a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 80s; so for the dirty '90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd fled to bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it's a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From a franchise's point of view, however, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just because of its absurd humor (an example is the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables narrated by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors departed from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel, "Ten Years Later," in which adults play adults, doesn't push the emotional level as much, and the satire is sporadic at times, including a parody of '90s thrillers like "Hand on the Cradle."
At one point, the character finds an Apple Powerbook, roller skates, and "a bunch of other 1991 stuff" in a pile of junk.
Many major storylines are repeated.
Kind-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the insane plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is instigated by George H.W. Bush (a very well-cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of a franchise is the many side stories.
It's especially fun to watch the eternally young, long-haired Rudd, aka Matt Dillon's character from Youth, whose once-respectable Andy character is now an old pepper.
The franchise could be kick-started by moments of random insanity, such as the returning "Seven Up" series, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," with the entire group heading to the premiere of "Years Unsurvivable" in the final scene.
Amazon's "Comrade Detective," meanwhile, appeals to a different type of nostalgia: the revivialisms of the Cold War series "Such Normal Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde: No Pity," and even the "GLOW" series, in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes collide.
The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to feel like a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 80s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, voiced into English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
Some jokes will make you laugh (like police officers watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
Many well-known actors have lent their voices to the series, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on a clumsy propaganda drama — which includes a killer with a Reagan mask — and looks like it.
Six long episodes are too long-winded, and there aren't enough comedic moments.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" might work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose lobby two fat men devour hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
The clear message to imaginary communist audiences is that Western culture can turn everything into food and.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture as well as theirs.
Russian athletes have not seen their IAAF ban lifted.
At a congress in London, the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian athletes due to a state-sponsored doping program.
As expected, voting at the World Championships, which will begin on Friday, turned out very clearly.
166 delegates voted in favor of extending the ban, only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF's special investigation group, Rune Andersen, told Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed, and coaches with tarnished reputations are still working in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"While progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes missed last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians who have previously proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time will take part in the upcoming World Cup.
However, they will not be able to compete in the national colours of the championship and will not play the Russian anthem if they win.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following lackluster economic growth and weakening inflation, which has stifled speculation of a sharp rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "in the background" as interest rates remain maintained - despite squeezing family budgets.
Politicians from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote to raise the interest rate supported lackluster economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that cuts in family budgets would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that over the next few years there should be growth due to inflation caused by Brexit and also said that rents from movable property in financial markets should rise more than expected.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package designed to boost the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the Term Finance Plan, which will offer cheap bank subsidies, is due to come into force next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption."
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would take to "tighten the belts of monetary policy" to calm inflation, and to a "higher rate" than markets expect.
Markets are currently predicting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
Projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the release of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after disappointing growth buried hopes for further growth, with GDP stalling at 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth will most likely remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is little consolation for households hit by rising inflation and paltry wage increases. The bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report goes on to say that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a decline in revenues in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow due to strong demand for British goods due to the weak pound, offsetting a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to a shocking EU referendum vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will take at least four years to fully unify prices and the economy.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many had called for a rate hike along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three politicians demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the bank saying it had expected such a change and inflation was expected to rise again over the next month.
The bank said the excess relative to the 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Managing Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only intensify as lenders start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those whose existing contracts and re-mortgages are coming to an end – there are fee-free options on offer, as well as low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
Patients will have access to 'transformative' treatment to prevent HIV from September, following a Supreme Court decision on NHS funding.
England's National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to around 10,000 patients as part of a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the probation after an appeals court upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year, saying the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund the drug.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was accepted by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. More clinics will join in October and by April 2018 there will be full implementation across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
Applying PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific medications in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will designate eligible participants who sign a consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GPs in the UK can also apply at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The scheme will cost taxpayers £10m and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute medicines after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, targeting, using and implementing it at scale.
Simon Stevens added: "This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years of efforts to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust, said: "We are witnessing a defining moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and does not require coaxing, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to receive this declaration.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; We must ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV."
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this medication may be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together to end the spread of HIV in society."
High life: the mezzanine and clever design have turned this small apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne smart terrace, it is an example of modern design that makes the most of the available space.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something more reasonable.
I stumbled upon this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him and nodded to him the same day."
Since then, the 1000 square meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-bedroom apartment with complicated layouts - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
"I wanted a high ceiling, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based design and design studio Duck & Shed and used the nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not only a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not so high that two gaps could fit above each other - the challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine on which it would be possible to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only a matter of building a simple platform, but also of bending the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - and at the same time add to the drama.
On the mezzanine, old copper window frames in Retrouvius design overlook the beautiful living room.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier by Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror skirting board in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen when it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution are the folding doors.
"We had to sort out the technical side," says Erfan of the reinforced veneered door.
"The door is counterweighted to make it very easy to pull away."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"For that matter, what you're selling is living space — or valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"Basically, a real estate agent calculates when entering an apartment, estimates its price based on the living area."
In this case, we managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
"You don't love the electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not win your heart."
As it turned out, high-quality design and increasing living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you may eventually decide to stay.
The United States is disconnecting.
The cultural and political gap between blue and red states is widening.
California has imposed a travel ban on its citizens traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and declared a retaliatory ban on its citizens traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
California has banned spending state money on its citizens' travel to eight other states: Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT and considers any expression of disagreement with LGBT lifestyles to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a conscientious objection law, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with therapy for LGBT patients is not obliged to provide it, but has an obligation to provide those patients with another therapist who does not.
Texas and other states have passed laws that require religious charities that give birth to children for adoption from their mothers are not required to give those children up for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California banned funding for its citizens' travel to eight states in the union.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposia in Texas, for example, reimbursed by their universities, because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in, say, Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They must either obtain federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund citizens' travel from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee has run out of patience and its House passed a bill with a resolution that it doesn't like California's policies of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still doesn't impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
It imposes them in retaliation for California's travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
These are the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass conscientious objection laws, as well as to decide what their money will and may not go to.
Second, what's wrong with conscientious objection?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and leave him alone and order the cakes from hundreds of bakers of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of a federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual States are free to adjust their internal, domestic policies with powers that are not federal to their liking, i.e., to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance of their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the live-and-leave rule that all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek extreme intolerance of others rather than tolerance of themselves and others.
According to them, no one should ever again express moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know of a situation in American history where states have made such a fuss about political issues, except in one case.
Even in times of struggle for black civil rights, where North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 50s of the 19th century, the political cause was slavery and the war of the North against the South was brewing.
Of course, this will not happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between blue, democratic and red Republican states is widening, and the US is mentally disconnected.
Unauthorised agitation.
A critic of Putin was fined heavily.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for encouraging people to take part in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for head of state next March.
The incumbent head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but it is widely expected that he will do so and win again.
Navalny said police came to his home in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"Later we will deduct them from the judge's salary," a Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
Russia's election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
But Navalny, who is considered an anti-corruption fighter, sees the verdict as politically motivated.
Fines of 300,000 rubles and 25,000 rubles respectively were imposed on Thursday by two members of Navalny's campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyashkin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are doing everything they can to prevent Navalny from campaigning.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, an appeals court upheld the verdict.
The verdict is final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million
More than four decades after their Italian family founded the empire, the two brothers are now vying for one of Victoria's most expensive properties, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides at the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute over community property and business assets all the way to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the bitter dispute is still being laundered before the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family bought its first store in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
It was here that the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 brick-and-mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The money bought more real estate and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who Paul says is a "major driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court filings state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, the distribution of property and funds became problematic.
"Colin's proposal was strongly in his favor in my eyes," Paul wrote in a sworn statement in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at conciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also vying to control the existing business - from which he says Colin has cut Paul.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed the conflict would be resolved.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that family is the most important thing of all," he wrote.
The cost of court hearings is rising. Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer flood attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and defense attorneys for both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been running milk bars and delicacies since the 50s of the 20th century and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 70s.
With the money raised by building on the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was just a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would go well.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family of companies. Colin said Mark was compensated $10 million and Luke $26 million upon his departure.
As Paul put it, both Luke and Mark "were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has held back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL board, according to Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and best friend of Colin, in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded via text message, in which he stated that since the dispute is being resolved in court, "I have nothing to add."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to take this matter to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements to the court, Colin said that he tried to adapt to his brother's requirements.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied to see our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was in sight.
"Our disputes will soon be resolved in court proceedings," Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers get water and summer clothes.
In the kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, which is now attended by about 35 children, they go out only in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide much shade.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers shower the children in the fog pit.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms where the blinds are drawn and the curtains are drawn.
They try to cool the air with an air purifier, because they do not have air conditioning.
It's also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature that is in the interior and exterior exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said Miloslava Makovičková, the director of the kindergarten.
There is a glass corridor in the nursery, where the temperature is around 40 degrees, according to her.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 o'clock, close the windows and we have blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
Better conditions are in the forest kindergarten Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have mature trees on the property, so we are under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree there, there is a table under it, and we do various things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the director of the kindergarten.
Teachers try to walk with children in the forest, where it is cooler.
Children wet caps and have various games with water on the program.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the director of the kindergarten on Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek district, also said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
They go out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child must wear a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose lightly sweetened tea or diluted juice, for example, and there are drinking fountains with water in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad to eat every day and fresh fruit and vegetables for snacks, sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"For example, today one mother brought about a ten-kilo watermelon for the children," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.
The Prague Public Transport Company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger area.
So far, the tram tracks have not been seriously damaged by the high temperatures.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
"Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and depots," Řehková said.
In depots and at some rotation points, employees have soda-makers at their disposal, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers are also given soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic eliminated 108 of them, which is twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting the fire.
"Fires in the natural environment predominate, as well as those associated with harvest work," fire spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral said.
Firefighters were not relieved by the evening weather change, when the heat in many places was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rainfall.
In connection with the storms, firefighters went to 236 interventions.
It was mainly the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
Firefighters also needed help in Stvolínky in the Českolipsko region, where they evacuated 60 people from a children's camp to safety due to a storm.
Tropical temperatures have also made Prague rescuers work.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances went to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cirque.
People should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curtail president's media diet
Before him, many have tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of President Trump's information — including television news coverage — in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here's part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day in his new role, he outlined a key problem with the Trump White House that he intends to fix: incorrect information that is getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told employees that they had to personally approve all the information — whether on paper or in a spoken word — because the president could make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors cut their teeth on Trump's control and media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades — and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching the news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was fitting to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media outlets that were easier to convince," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told POLITICO in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check — at least in the words of six former campaign organizers — is to ensure that Trump regularly watches media that praises him."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don't know — that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked.
Tweets that Trump never sent will most likely never be known.
If his employees managed to keep him at bay at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from stirring up controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by foisting materials — which may or may not be reliable — that support their worldview.
In May, Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the propensity of advisers to present dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information written by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially leak reports, and seeks to trace their origins.
That happened in late February, when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com — the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson — that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of many leaks" from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was forever banished from Twitter for harassment; or that he has not substantiated his claim with any evidence; Or that he had published false allegations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is trying to pursue the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness is not going away, and his aides are still vying for power.
These immutable factors are sure to aggravate Kelly's mission.
Tourists negotiate to moat and return to 'Millionaire's Quarter'
Some of England's wealthiest homeowners in England's West Midland are once again at odds with determined tourists, who are negotiating with local authorities for rights to reclaim their land.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field off a thriving street in the town of Solihull, dubbed the 'millionaire's quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists are returning after being expelled in May. They were not afraid of the ditch, which was dug on the spot on the basis of the orders of the authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
The tactful group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the caravan field through an unprotected gap that served as a path.
Angry residents of the district attacked the Solihull City Council, saying it was 'unable to solve the problem'.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "They occupied the site on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street where they threw stones at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and have now returned.
Others arrived last night, and there will probably be more today.'
She added: "Birmingham's board of directors knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to pay taxes until the board of directors has dealt with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: 'It's ridiculous. Just recently we watched the last departing tourists and now they are back.
And this time there are even more, and this time they brought horses with them.'
A spokesman for the Solihull City Council said: "We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and are working with local police to take the necessary legal action to resolve the issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or illegal behaviour to the police on 101.
That will give us the full picture to present in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
It was brought by a government special.
A government special transported the injured Robert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and on board the plane he was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
According to information from TV JOJ, Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from the NOVA party.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians Toughen Fight Against NGO Rescue Ships with Migrants on Board;
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving off the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless NGOs sign new rules regulating their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the German rescue organization ship Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, making illegal immigration much easier.
The rescue organization, which is in its first year, declined to comment on the matter because of allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us, saving human lives is and always will be the number one priority. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on all the current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking the Jugend Rettet ship Iuventa since October.
Its crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship who were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the plaintiff's file. The meeting was published by Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area — out of humanitarian enthusiasm, more than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected by the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp drop in migrants disembarking in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to increase patrols off the coast of Libya and work with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
He also revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite were crawling out of her overalls!
Hot summer days are completely tempting to wear only the most necessary things that cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone involved with TV Prima were teeming, she wrapped her body in mini overalls.
And just a few normal movements and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
The jumpsuit had cut between her halves many times, and it had slipped so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly had no shortage of attention from the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of texting Conrad Roy suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of her two-year sentence behind bars before spending five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of inadvertent manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told the court on Thursday: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left at large pending a decision.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there as the verdict was announced, tears in her eyes, folded hands and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
Carter's lawyer, however, said these were "unfortunate circumstances that she deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "Not a day goes by that I don't mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me – I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," the statement read.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of a person I've seen since I was born is a pain I'll carry with me for life," she said.
Massachusetts does not have a valid law that penalizes a person aiding the suicide of another person. This case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the seat of a car poisoned by carbon dioxide in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages were released inciting suicide.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care," read a text message Carter sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before the suicide, she texted him: "You have to do it Conrade" and "Just turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter craved attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from making any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Audi modifies up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before Audi's announcement, automaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes there are "more smart options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities — including Munich, which is based on BMW — that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called the decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of installing equipment to neutralise the gases emitted by diesel engines is increasing, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced emissions during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo's former manager, Giovanni Pamio, is of Italian nationality and is not subject to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined a criminal investigation by German police into the Volkswagen case after authorities accused Audi of installing a system designed to circumvent European emissions limits — expanding the charges Audi faces in the U.S.
Audi's inclusion in the investigation could have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the little girl died.
The accident occurred on Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias television that the plane flew just above people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from the danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people did not manage to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom escaped alive and were taken away by police for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a motorway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, although it began to be built in 1978.
Even though it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it must not be built further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 motorway in Hradec Králové.
The construction of another section of the section was newly stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least several months.
We East Czechs get the highway in pieces, like cutting salami.
A circle will be cut and then it remains to be seen when and if we will get the next one.
At the same time, we do not want anything miraculous.
We just want to reduce travel time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland out of villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not how to reasonably bypass.
But the last section of our dream motorway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since.
Therefore, when the construction of the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové began recently, and on other sections to Jaroměř, archaeological research began, with the construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of earplugs in eastern Bohemia.
After all, no one believed it anymore.
Last week it became clear that construction will not take place this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed an appeal.
Children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
In their appeal, they request a review of all binding opinions of all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Hradec City Hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
Meanwhile, we are leaving the D11 near the village with the eloquent name Pohřebačka.
So we go down, just drive on the highway and suddenly we stand on a side road and prefer to then join the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own Undertaker.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network practically incomplete in the current system?

Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the southeastern French region, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to the arid climate and harmful insects, causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavender cultivation in Provence is under threat because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
Cicadas and grasshoppers carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in arid climates are also to blame."
The stakes are high.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil produced from it is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
Of course, the amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is smaller."
A possible solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and slow the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breed more species resistant to dry weather.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest taking place in the Sinaloa region involving organized criminals, corrupt officials and the ongoing drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, they gather mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important for them to change their habits.
Two veteran journalists talk about what would be safer: take their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to put names next to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and premonition.
Drug traffickers, politicians, traffickers and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal conduct.
The violence does not cease and bodies pile up across the country; the number of journalists among them continues to increase: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection following attacks and threats; And seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is felt, even if his presence is pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", pointing to the middle finger, hangs in the façade of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, wear a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; Journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it has so far prosecuted two suspects, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Journalists' killers are very rarely brought to justice.
Riodoca journalists insist on reporting on the violence taking place in Sinaloa; Even though they are devastated by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and no prospect of justice, a meeting about security is pointless, Ibarra says.
"It's foolish to waste time on meetings like this," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoca in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which translates as The Twelfth River.
The gunmen then got into his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors seem to spread quickly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions try to fill the void.
Several people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of ornate two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "ceasefire" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, the co-founder and CEO of Riodoce, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
Reconciliation could have angered the sons; The suspected gang members bought up all copies of the newspaper the moment it landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in Mexican criminals' fight against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
He was virtually a veteran at Noroeste when he decided to sell his $50 stock in 2003 and form Riodoca with five colleagues.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning the drug trade," Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a reputation for brave and truthful reporting; The newspaper began to thrive.
Journalists liked to investigate problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on Mexico's drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I feared for my life," he said when accepting the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do in the face of death? Why didn't you say what's going on?'"
Riodoca employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his banter and rude language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his cap.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions – how to do their job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret airfields."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not right here, hands off.
The problem, said Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the Javier thing."
The old rules, he said, no longer apply in Sinaloae — as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoca staff meet; A few days ago, spyware was discovered that governments bought to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two policemen find relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodoc offices, located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers who the government says are corrupt.
It's been months since journalists last ventured into mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They also have a feast on suspicious government spending that took place in the governor's hometown.
Recently, there were also several kidnappings at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one has announced the identities of the abductees or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary of writing about what every resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination of drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from the public record that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has controlled all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been indicted for high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including one in which one of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped an army riot squad.
Just a month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would definitely crack the case," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has been turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists. The employees certainly did not expect to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went the next morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoacán state.
Only a charred body was discovered. Authorities say that based on DNA analysis, it is Adameus.
The activity of journalists is intensifying across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribble on sidewalks and "SOS tisk" buildings.
The newspaper's director, Bojorquez, is visiting Washington today to seek international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and murdering them for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she has asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger could jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said Mexican journalists are "surrounded by" organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who collaborate with organized crime.
Media surveillance group Articulo 19 blamed more than half of all attacks on journalists, police officers and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
Next to the severed head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down, such as the newspaper El Norte, based on the northern border of Chihuahua state, in response to the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others still continue, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with a front-page article titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It is a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being persecuted.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinoso, who was murdered along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruza.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their job, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet one day, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday midnight, and Riodoca employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office — the latest issue sent to the printer — sipping a beer when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police near a beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left by syndicate members in the area promised.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phones on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the opening title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez glances at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they are afraid, they do not show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical — whose middle finger is the telling slogan for the whole of Sinaloe — all Riodoce employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we even think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when, on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out into the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however frightening.
Researchers have now revealed the findings of the first findings of an amazing rhinoceros-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains — which experts have dubbed the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs' — were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved at such a high rate that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a 'troubled past'.
An article in the journal Current Biology called it 'the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world'.
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous Period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved condition shocked researchers, who described it as 'truly remarkable'.
The armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind to date, according to National Geographic.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to excavate the animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready for detection.
'You just have to squint a little and you'll believe he's asleep,' said lead author Caleb Brown and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
'It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and surviving species of dinosaur - the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
By studying its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore — despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank — was most likely to face a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many animals today.
Experts say this allowed him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests that it was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of a 110-million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for inspection at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum engineer Mark Mitchell, who and his team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They revealed a camouflage method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is possible, therefore, that the dinosaur was so numerous predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation in survival.
Many present-day camouflaged animals—such as deer, zebra, and armadillo—are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus must have literally fought for its survival.
"The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by predators during the Cretaceous period," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown in color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more information about its life, including preserved stomach contents, to trace its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta area at that time had the same climate as in present-day Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched much farther inland than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time it is preserved in three dimensions so that you can see its original size," Brown said.
'For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did in the Cretaceous era.
You do not need to use your imagination to reconstruct it; Just squint a little and it looks like he's just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous period, huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that moved on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been the favorite prey of its equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt's body was washed up into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including its skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The animal averaged 5 meters in length and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm spines protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, 'finding such a surviving individual can be compared to winning a lottery.
The longer I watch it, the more shocking I find the find.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his toes pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over her body.
The day after arriving in New York, the St. Louis native sat on a bed in her Airbnb room and scrolled through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a post by a high school student.
"Police have just shot dead an 18-year-old youth whose body is still lying in the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else had written her the post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her wall posts.
The St. Louis rapper tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying motionless on the street, from where he had not been taken away after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to return to it in the evening, watching tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched photos of police tapes and people screaming. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign that read, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
She watched the live news - one of the policemen stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and a dog barking at the other end.
In another video, another police officer held a gun she said pointed at the crowd and yelled, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell told herself.
"This is not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and can call normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is told in a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" that will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and resilience, told from the perspective of people living in a community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell initiated a dialogue with her daughter — dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband — about a topic they had discussed many times before — "the experience with black people."
"Remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"There was no way I wouldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the culmination of... that happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but she also needed to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we had to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism firsthand, she is no different from another black child – a woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only hurt her."
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road, opposite the Police Department, which became a base for activists who awaited Officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
There, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped distribute it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly emerging.
"My activism was turned upside down after Aug. 9," Ferrell said, adding that while attending a college at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she said. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and pushed for health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the documentary's later co-director, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "just document" the events.
But Ferrell wondered, "Are you working on a documentary, or are you trying to find a story that can be used?"
This type of skepticism permeated the community through many people, often white, who wanted to capitalize on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a non-daunted interview, "We've heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already partnered with co-director Damon Davis, an acclaimed local artist who works on the subject of death row inmates.
His participation in the project also involved Ferrell and six other locals who were tracked by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"No one is speaking for us in this document, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"That was important to me — how these people will be represented — because that's how I'm going to be represented."
While the documentary's goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experiences — in an effort to portray that the movement "isn't about a savior leader, but about bringing the community together," Folayan said — she turned out to be the most open to participating in filming.
"Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face as she thought of the first time she saw the final version of the documentary.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up."
Ferrell's story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders — who created a social media #BlackLivesMatter campaign in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 — call themselves weirdos.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately committed to preserving the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women have to endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of eccentric black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not just an affirmative affirmative issue" and Ferrell is not the protagonist of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"That she found herself on the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the rush of energy in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV cameras have vacated their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home "disorder."
Yet she continues the commitment she has made since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we have to lose is our chains."
A field was burning in the Kolín region.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter also helped.
Not far from Český Brod in the Kolín region, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15 p.m., and firefighters declared the third level of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighters spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, a helicopter also helped extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage worth 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames at the scene.
The fire arose due to a technical defect in the engine compartment of the combine.
A helicopter also helped to extinguish the fire, which made a total of six water drops.
"We handed over the place of intervention to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 it will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: the artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and dark - hanging from the ceiling on wires. Each of them seemed to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally publishing classified cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left the US presidency.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with that genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a poignant, if not intellectual, commentary on the docility of DNA—as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted—and the inherent determinism of those interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken from a young age about considering herself a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violation of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were withheld by prison staff. Only one lower-quality black-and-white photograph was leaked, showing Manning, visibly alarmed, sitting in the driver's seat in the platinum blond wig with which she is now associated.
In 2015, positive responses to Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 project Stranger Visions were still reverberating.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of possible images of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were interviewing Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to supplement the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they contacted Chelsea to ask if they would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the comic was published, President Obama asked for Manning's release, a welcome change after several unbearable years in a military prison in Kansas.
Interestingly, the exhibition comes at a time when Donald Trump is waging war on government insiders and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to stoke resentment in areas he is supposed to support with his tweets.
In response to a question about this strange timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything happens for a reason."
Under the artist's statement on one of the gallery walls, Manning, with her huge signature (the letter "i" in her surname is dotted with a heart), calls for an end to "automatic factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope people take away that our genome doesn't care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said. You can also see her 2007 work Spurious Memories on the theme of video.
"DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page from the above-mentioned graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"As soon as they prevent you from speaking, they win," it reads.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"It gives me goosebumps when I think about it."
Manning has yet to visit the exhibition in person — as predicted in the comic book — but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic effigies, lined up like a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the almost 160 cm tall statue of Maningová, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to exude the feeling of a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates them."
Northwest University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for first-degree murder for a man named Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to a Cook County court file.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body was found on July 27.
Police officers were alerted to this fact by telephone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Meanwhile, police are searching for the two suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has served as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from the university's campus.
"The matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwest University is cooperating fully with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been contacted by British police and are ready to assist US police as well."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and wanted him to turn himself in to police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations for the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging suspects to surrender to appropriate authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down the suspects are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were supposed to have occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"We will finalize the WADA plan in the near future" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented.
"At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been finalised and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, WADA's plan has been updated," Mutko said Thursday.
The Vice Chairman commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the Code – which describes the renewal criteria for RUSADA – which was recently posted on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing to worry Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of these criteria, however, calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation by Richard McLaren into the government's alleged sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes.
Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, so we can't admit to something that never existed."
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia's RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservations," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of imposing doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
After visiting the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "on the right track" to renew.
Police have charged three people, one of whom is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting fire to a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in the Frýdek-Místek region on Wednesday.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the crime of public endangerment.
Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very recent issue and the police are currently working on a motive," Kužel said.
He said police would discuss the possible remand of the accused.
Further information cannot be disclosed, according to the director.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and investigation service and the public prosecutor who supervises the matter are really working on the matter," Kužel said.
The wooden church of Corpus Christi in Guty dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the Ministry of Culture and the city are ready to share other costs, a public collection is also being prepared and a contribution from the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by a defect in the wiring.
In its place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
Financial support for associations usable in the defence of the state, voluntary shooting training or a team of training trainers is envisaged by the factual intention of the Act on the Readiness of Citizens for the Defence of the State.
The Ministry of Defence, which was given the task of processing it by the government, hopes that it will succeed in increasing the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This follows from the proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law is adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on military support.
According to its authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of military duty and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists with financial or material and would make it possible to increase the abilities of their members.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the aid of the country in times of crisis if necessary, and on their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help associations and other interested parties with training or education.
It is also planned to organize discussions with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One of the possible options assumes that a new office would be created to be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after a state of emergency has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between individual types of threats," the plan states, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministry officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves or contribute to the protection of others, and not to complicate the performance of tasks by the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic by improper behavior," the plan states.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office anticipates financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million a year.
Other money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that the remit of regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which would employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
Representatives of the ministry have previously said that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.
Startups that help your company stay the next Uber
Amy Erretta wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at her e-commerce startup, but couldn't find a matching survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even deceptive.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based hair care e-commerce company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New HR startups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a complaints hotline, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact CEOs directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that Glint has given her a greater awareness of what her employees are thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and specific team polls, Glint offers a company heat map and a quick overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers – allowing the user to work on remediation.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to be mindful of the culture of the work environment — in case they become the next Uber — which is mired in scandals after a former employee posted on his blog describing the company's environment and the harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a website dedicated to technical and financial advancements, the value of the global control, regulation, and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small surge in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convercent's nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, it has also taken Uber under its wing.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "lightning" surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the CEO is involved, complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The Court of Public Opinion has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of startup Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior — and regulators fail to step in — it could face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
Employing more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail to the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a discouraging and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there had previously been no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it ensures that problems are quickly detected and resolved that never before reached office managers, miles away from actually resolving complaints – such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's closer to a holistic, holistic view of the employee experience," said Vitrano, who manages the risk management group at Ruby Tuesday.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from lawsuits from employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following the collapse of Enron over the abuse of employees' ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media took a spot" that companies began to realize that they couldn't simply hide their skeletons in a closet online.
"Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It's a business model and an opportunity endorsed by bold equity investors who have backed both startups.
Convercent raised a total of $10 million from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital as part of its February campaign, eventually taking home $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the reciprocal nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and that they dedicate their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
"When people are happy in their jobs, feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are committed to the company's success," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if a company is doing well, and a company prospers if its employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors who support this effort.
According to experts on work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The reality is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can happen.
And if change does not happen quickly - in the worst case not at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, chief advisory officer at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too heavily on data alone.
"Because as soon as you don't get things done, employees start asking, 'Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?'" "
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, can solve the problem in one day thanks to Glint, Herretto said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Erretta was able to reorganize several teams within the company and begin communications training to successfully resolve the issue.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important insight into its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long run in an industry known for frequent layoffs.
"If you don't strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won't trust you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday became the hottest day.
With 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic so far.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about it.
Compared to Tuesday on Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, Bohemia was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equalled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring more than 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice, today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as at Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the hottest was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
On the other hand, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, today's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the CHMI website.
"Temperatures there only started to rise later this afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to CHMI, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
We have such a bad habit here.
Billionaires don't have the same vote as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as brazen as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejšek's Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Party of Privateers.
The political movement Agrofert, as the mayor of Kroměříž, Jaroslav Němec, inadvertently named Andrej Babiš's project, is a chapter in itself.
The Mayors also recently caught their billionaire.
It is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the Jablotron security equipment company.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayor's jersey but Dědek did not succeed very well.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he told a news conference.
This means that my goal is for the ANO movement, for the Mayors movement to get twenty percent in the elections.
Some smiled.
Grandpa's slip of the tongue is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to compete for votes in the Mayors' jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Dědek supported Babiš in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned orator and does not possess the attractive rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he definitely does not go into politics because he wants to improve personally.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his controlled world and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to imagine possible cooperation with Babis.
Some may appreciate that Dědek does not change his opinions and stands his ground regardless of what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so clumsy to the Mayors to build his B-class.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron has not broken up with the head of Agrofert in a bad way in the shop and is looking for another way to defend his business rival.
However, Dědek's first public appearances did not revolve only around Babiš.
Dědek promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to think about such a statement.
After all, the judicially recognized thug Zdeněk Bakala squandered millions in all directions before the 2010 elections.
The political division of Vít Bárta's security agency, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats together came to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
When Dědek enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he would not have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
Dědek crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with university education come to us about fifty thousand a month.
Those with a basic one of less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich by local standards.
The one with twenty poor.
In Dědek's vision of society, the poor honestly pay taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, in which they do not participate much.
In short, the rich must be helped not to toil misery with need.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš rubs his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Dědek, can confirm that billionaires are not nice people.
The question then remains who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have members of their party or citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often he is not helped by 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex was sold, the price went down by an incredible £8 million.
This was reported by the Mirror.co.uk website.
The brochure says of the plot, "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the US president did not justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by a whopping £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, with the final price dropping to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And it's no wonder.
This stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin features 12 full-size bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gym and more.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also has a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the plot.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was reflected in the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
He was to buy the property for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA has decided to do away with two practices a day. There are long days for the Bruins
It's approaching eleven o'clock in the morning, and UCLA football players are crammed into the sidelines of a new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys, revealing sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of doing nothing are substitutes for a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will retire to their rooms after a three-hour practice session to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30 a.m. the following morning.
"The next three days are going to be a tough job for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said moments before Monday rolled into Tuesday.
By eliminating two practices in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve players — ironically, it makes training days even longer — at least until Friday, when final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. — to fit into many students' already crowded schedules.
For the first time in Mora's six seasons as a coach at Westwood, Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and practices are limited throughout the summer semester. This is also influenced by the decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day.
A total of eighteen practices are scheduled until August 20, after which formal preparations begin for the first match against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's decision, even though it added another item to an already busy schedule.
"For three or four days the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after training camp is over, which won't be easy looking at the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after clearing the protective net behind the goal post.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by a security service," Mora added.
"Safety is taken care of, but it's not out of the question that someone can rent a room and record our workouts.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot no. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe that everything will turn out well.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans more thorough fact-checking to reduce fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles for review to third parties and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news," the largest social network said Thursday.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election for the president of the United States.
There are political debates in Europe about the matter. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of fake news about May's presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on social media networks in advance of the September election if it does not promptly remove angry posts.
Facebook said in another statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it plans to start testing a new fake news control feature in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing news verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and make the right decisions about what they can share," Sara Su, product manager for news at Facebook, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Making a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently played the main role in the music video of the band Squeeze and Margaret Thatcher also found refuge there during the 70s and 80s of the last century.
But from his cozy spot by the River Bewl in Kent, UK, Scotney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history that inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire - known for his penchant for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"Looking at the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a straight face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of the families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library documents – a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 70s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like going back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to stay in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I extended my stay a bit.")
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on the wall and bottles that had been dumped in a moat for centuries.
He walked around the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking with gamekeepers, gardeners and occasionally with artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
At night, he "drank whiskey and wrote."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to the documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to break into the archives, which Rhodes described as "aristocrats of many centuries throwing up their hands saying, 'Take it to the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps showing estates: "You may think that a land dispute is boring," said Rhodes, "but I have come across one case where two families were fighting over a birch tree.
Stop the people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a revolt in the castle in 1380 called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
"The English insurrection actually began in this area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're related after all."
Other stories are closely tied to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who supposedly staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (which wasn't discovered until several years later after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was intrigued by the male race – men back then were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies—I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to mess with the heads of heiresses."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he soaked up inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that has been swallowed up by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I was like, 'Now to get the hell back to real life.'"
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media have published the words of President Donald Trump about the new immigration plan of the USA, which will also change the granting of green cards.
The number of legal immigrants is projected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year due to stricter rules on temporary work visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules are being proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will favor English-speaking applicants who abound in funds and demonstrate skills that will benefit our country," Trump said, as quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on our guard
Just when it seemed that 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots appeared on the Internet.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
Noel Sharkey, former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, said the rise of sex robots needed to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of their nipples and the look of the robot's nails.
"People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often," Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids are changing from inflatable dolls to robotic women with silicone leather that is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course there is artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to their own image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would embarrass even the Stepford mistress.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into silicone skin robotic women.
The owner of a RealBotix robot can set different character traits for his surrogate wife, among them shyness.
And then there's True Companion's Roxxxy Gold sex robot woman, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the "frigid Farrah," who is characterized by a shy nature, and "wild Wendy," who has an "adventurous" nature.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is designed to suit your personality to the maximum extent possible," reads the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She is even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - not the confusion with real interpersonal relationships. Rather, inferior female character traits and violent innuendos are disturbing, such as the frigid (read: defiant) Farrah.
True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men on their website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" the page reads.
However, sex robots are not just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture—a shift from ideal or gender equality toward a desire for compelling sex with optional extras.
Of course, most men don't buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public's interest.
But this marginal interest can become a mirror set up to the current modern age.
And most people aren't geeky or violent unless the free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are winning their rights and there is a president in the White House who often speaks very derogatorily about women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see—the hanging bodies and hollowed-out eyes—but rather the reality of the visions.
The book The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (albeit with the measurements of a actress).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to the touch and look like a real woman at first glance.
However, when it comes to their "personality", a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or history. Nothing that would encourage their independence or undermine their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
In the language of the 21st century: maids.
An NBA star on a green pitch.
Curry fights for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry was not lost among professional golfers despite a botched first shot in his first start.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player winner played a 74-shot first-round at the Ellie Mae Classic Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State point guard, who won his second NBA title this season with the Warriors, started off nervously, and his first shot ended up in a cup holder in a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate between holes as under the basketball hoop, but he still left behind a dozen professionals with a balance of four shots over par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee after the first shot, but then it settled down a little bit," Curry said, adding that he had a huge stage fright.
It was very nerve-wracking to hit the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I hoped for.
"If you had told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would have taken it immediately," he added.
If Curry can make the cut, which is likely to be two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've got rid of stage fright, hopefully it will work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he competes for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
By contrast, Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense
An unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, tear entire families apart.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, American newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
Supposedly, we are just waiting for our nerves to loosen.
But less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm talking about this because my cousin, a poet and left-wing fan who lives in Chicago and who has long been a Republican fool in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that being united in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the entire family — including all the Republican siblings with whom they have bickered over politics for years — is on the same wavelength.
At dinner at the family table, this is a good thing; But it strikes me that, in a broader context, this poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his antics may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what might be called rational.
In these days, I remember with nostalgia in my heart Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior — a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax returns) — both of which look like very mild misdeeds compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican nominee to be at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest merry-go-round run by the New York Parks Department—you won't find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filming and staring at their shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy sight and tinkling music strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama gets worn out instead of breathing the atmosphere on you and the reality of the city does not live up to your expectations.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't really Swiss cheese – not counting the themed Ye Olde Swiss Cottage pub – but a London Underground station.
However, the carousel in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, so much so that it has great fun for two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women.
If I could evaluate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points. Fortunately, no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience in a store when I was asked to rate my "experience" on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
It's the same in the café on the corner of my street, except that I can add a 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does this slow down the otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to curry favor with shoppers when it's not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my credit card handover with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrists, which the prison said he had self-inflicted after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the toilet closet door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces up to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive cub was born by a bred panda that mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of captive pandas.
Zhang Zhangzhong, an employee at the center, told the New China news agency that panda farming poses a high risk from inbreeding.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to mate captive pandas with wild pandas is the first step to helping to protect the species.
Fifteen-year-old Caocao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to a tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every step.
She met her chosen one Caocao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with a male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males rather poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, considering that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, the statement was quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained in the early hours of August 1 by Sithonia police.
All were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened free camping rules and impose severe fines on anyone caught in a site where camping is not allowed.
Inspections will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in fiftieth place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is tied for 50th after the first round of a British Open major.
She completed the course at Kingsbarns, Scotland, with a score of one stroke under par, making three birdies and two bogeys.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has the hope of making the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million contest, American star Michelle Wie went the best, winning the first round in a course record of 64 shots, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch food safety authority NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it said meant 80 percent of eggs on the market were safe.
The Authority stressed that only a limited number of egg types, identifiable by specific numbers, pose a risk.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it poses a potential threat to children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for the Czech SVA, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also closed their farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where problematic brands of insecticide have appeared.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against fleas, lice and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the preparation to be mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I would still like to catch for ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," smiled the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement before the start of the new year.
How were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like in school, it would be three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I learned.
The second year I started fishing.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper with whom I alternated again.
Last year I expected to catch all the time.
But in the first ten games we only got maybe five points, so the coaches started spinning it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
What was life like in Riga?
Gorgeous.
It is a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I will miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We are together for three years, next year we will get married.
So I brought something with me.
How difficult is the KHL for goaltenders?
The top ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, which have to change their playing style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem with the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Did you have a problem traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If a person does not have a family, this is not a problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done so that you play four away matches and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everyone is cheering.
Even when things weren't going well, a lot of people were coming.
Did Dinamo's time in the KHL help Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results at the World Cup began to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they lost 2-1 to Canada in the quarterfinals.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts has established himself in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is about to sign the contract.
Why do so many come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are one of them.
It is a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for a goalie, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final they decided to go for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to appear.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where I will sign.
How realistic is the possibility that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where things turn out.
Now I can only wait to see what the agent will arrange.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn't one for me to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's drift at Let continues.
In January of this year, I am in the article With due managerial care? he wrote, among other things, about the camp at Lety u Orlíku.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the key passages of the article.
The Lety camp has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it will probably be best if they look, for example, at the official website of the cultural monument Reverent place Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8.8.1940 it served as a labour camp, from 1.1.1942 it was a collection camp and from 2.8.1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first Lety prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of immense suffering for human beings, inflicted on them by human beings and a perverted ideology.
There is no doubt that it is necessary to constantly commemorate these events.
There is also no doubt that the commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the experienced suffering of these people.
The problem lies elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten and in the 70s of the 20th century a pig farm was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, and in 1995 a memorial was unveiled at Lety.
In the mid-90s of the 20th century, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far it has not happened.
In 1998 the memorial was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the farm.
So many very briefly facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to prepare an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
We will see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it won't be cheap.
And yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp, there is a memorial, in the reconstruction of which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction were financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not a possibility, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Does the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of remembrance, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy and whoever wants to can pay their respects to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let us leave it as it is and maintain the reverent place with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, including taxpayers' money, should be treated by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with due managerial care.
At least with the same as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
Even so, from the perspective of the above-mentioned facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement as just empty pre-election proclamations.
This May, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exposition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own reverent place, which is made of stones located on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the importance of this place, as befits and belongs.
At present, archaeological research is underway on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the uncovered foundations could be preserved and at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could stretch his efforts in this direction.
If he manages to push through the purchase of the pig farm for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate can relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that support gut resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
As soon as the scales tilt to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between a type of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body's tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had."
He also suggested that if the same was shown to be true for humans, then combining L. reuteri with a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory gut environment.
Graduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, studying a certain type of immune cells that promote body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group of identical mice kept separately lacked cells.
She deduced that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome — a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
Mice that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked an gut microbiome — so they did not develop this kind of immune cell — were given L. reuteri and developed immune cells.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid—without the bacterium—to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, after halving the doses of tryptophan, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known if tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan added: "All of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control inflammation of the inner surface of the gut.

Jose Mourinho considers Nemanjo Matic's signing and his move to Manchester United 'brilliant'
Manchester United have acquired a "genius" in the form of Nemanjo Matic - or so Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matic, who signed a £40m contract, made his mark in the first leg with a 2-1 win in Dublin – the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United face Real Madrid on Tuesday – and impressed in his role as midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matic was in no form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needs to be worked on before the start of next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset – he thinks football-wise," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleven for next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three other players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players into the squad.
"I thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they did their best for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins, Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to take shape thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdeňkova akademie.
Pear immediately saw a chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to join your cooking academy because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he urged him in a video on social media.
And because the two of them have been tiptoeing each other for several years, Lada didn't forget to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from diet chicken, American cucumbers or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Pear said.
He is serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say," he told Blesk.
Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show, Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima reacted to Hruška's participation in the culinary academy, saying that she takes the whole thing as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
Hruška dealt Pohlreich a big blow in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
Within a few days, it sold over 300,000 units!
The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting schedule, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from among the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show Now the Boss Cooks in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ironed on the back of his T-shirt.
If my face was there, I would laugh a lot.
"I just smile at the pear - pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Lada responded.
He has his own thoughts about Láďa's culinary art.
"Cooking according to Ládi Hruška is out of the question even at home, because I don't let gastropunk go home," the boss is clear.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, I even make chicken with honey according to him.
But his recipes will definitely not appear in my show," Hruška said.
He's an!
He's no cook to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or moron," Pohlreich said of Hruška at a lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore," Hruška said of the insults uttered.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock his car and house with a wave
A British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the doors of his home and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is currently offering the same service through his company, BioTeq, to companies and individuals who want to use technology to simplify their lives.
The implantation process and adherence to treatment procedures is supervised by Dr Geoff Watson, anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a microchip-compatible door and car lock replacement service. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one has had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn for last month's celebration of the U.S. manufacturing industry cost $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials toured the product parade from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn in an "emergency," according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for managing the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy commander for aviation, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7 a.m. for the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. and will remain in place until the site is completely cleared, which was scheduled to be cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The email further stated that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained at the scene that evening along with the helicopter, along with a unit of security personnel.
It was not clear from the footage - obtained by TIME - whether a second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
"We wondered if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" show was designated as an official event by the White House and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
In attending the event, the president pushed for health care reform that was passing the Senate and spoke of trying to rein in government regulations.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after a presidential plane taxied in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is flooded with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is delighted with the 'Made in America' show, which showcased products from all 50 states that Americans make from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often practice landing in the Washington area and South Lawn and practice possible arrivals with the President of the United States at the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew's current training, a state official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew another eleven hours as part of "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said no other props were paid for with taxpayer money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had no involvement in negotiations to build a helicopter at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the show is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, while DoD reimbursement for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records show a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the helicopter's actual operating costs are well below that amount.
"To state taxpayer costs based on reimbursement estimates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staffing, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursements do not include personnel costs, but do include fuel costs, maintenance, and contract costs.
Then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for parade purposes.
"The idea behind the show this week is to showcase products made in the U.S.," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state, and that they provide jobs for hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, as do most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities that countless American citizens are involved in building.
This fact should be recalled."
It's unclear if Trump also looked at the helicopter on his patrol to South Lawn. All we can say for sure is that he got behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three myself."
A young woman got stuck in a swamp near Macha Lake, the police waded towards her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around two o'clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use her cell phone to ask the police for help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"For this reason, the officers soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols went to the place she roughly described, but finding the young woman was not easy.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through the reed marshes hundreds of meters before they felt solid ground under their feet," Baláková said.
And so was the missing.
The officers were guided by the direction from which her call for help was coming from.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down aloud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at a quarter to five in the swamps in the locality of Borný.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance took her to the hospital in Česká Lípa.
Connection between Dědek and STAN?
The desired bride becomes a saleable girl.
That's a bit ironic.
With his web project, hledameslusny.cz as if the billionaire was basically telling voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that the politically heterogeneous bunch of lesser-known mayors and independents actually has no national program for the parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with Dědek, whatever his political opinion.
Vít Bárta used to start like this and it didn't end very well.
In his hunt for decent people and personalities who may replace some mayors on the lists, which even Gazdík admitted, Dědek also cancels the popular argument of the STAN leader that the greatest value of the movement is precisely politically proven and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to polls.
They will now be replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
Gazdík also explained the total break with the People's Party, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the People's Party lists.
But if only a few people suspected STAN of identity at that time, after the arrival of Dědek, the mere identity game ends.
Not only Gazdík has long defined himself against Andrej Babiš's ANO, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated as follows: "My goal is for the ANO movement, that is, the Mayors movement, to get twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
Dědek is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly no coincidence.
He often talks about politics in a similar way to Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek's helping hand seems to be turning the desired bride into a sellable girl even more.
For some time STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People's Party and now it is looking for decent people.
Hopefully someone will get in touch.
Police dogs trained helicopter flights in Most
Dogs specializing in searching for explosives and search dogs practiced helicopter flights at Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of the police cynologists of the Usti Region.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both adult trained dogs and those who are still undergoing training.
In addition to the standard training, during which they were supposed to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the missing helper, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in a helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work so that it does not have a problem with the helicopter journey.
"A helicopter lands, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tomasek said.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately after a helicopter journey is excluded from training.
"Usually, the dog handlers leave them in the garden, for example," added Tomášek.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Usti Region.
German shepherds predominate, but the number of Belgian shepherds is also increasing.
The handler takes care of him from puppyhood.
"He raises him himself, prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us," added Tomášek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and not timid, it passes the first exams at 20 months.
"He gets into a sharp hit around two and a half to three years," Tomasek added.
The length of service in the police depends on the state of health of the dog.
They usually serve within eight to ten years.
They then usually live with their handlers.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar Is Out and Cali Cartel Becomes the Focal Point of Netflix's Hit Series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has already been confirmed for the third and fourth seasons - the former has already seen the first trailer and an outline of other villains.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company," except that they escalate acts of violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian drug enforcement officers.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
UN says Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, take part, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, a senior official at the United Nations Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women were taking part in local council elections, three women were running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women take part, as well as all related election-related processes.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued several threats against the electoral process, which is putting international combat activity on the back burner.
In this year's elections, for the first time, a democratically elected government is handing over power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said a strong role for women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission said 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters were women.
A unique brewery is brewing beer again.
For a good beer in the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobeč near Mšeno back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt into a steam engine operation.
Years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served as a state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building material.
In 2007, however, a new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully studied archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same appearance as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building also became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they ceremonially renewed the tradition of brewing.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque countryside of Kokořínsko, visit the bar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use Kokořín water springing in the protected landscape area, malt from the Lobeč fields and Saaz hops.
In the bar you can taste traditional pale lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and half past two.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type in the world?
Such a unique building was supposed to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a large underground.
There was to be a headquarters, barracks, ammunition and material depots, a power plant, an engine room and a hospital.
However, the construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and the underground spaces were quarried.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early nineties, you can also come here.
The underground is already 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the infantry blockhouse T-S 73 with an exhibition and underground, the complex also includes an armed object of light fortification, as well as two infantry blockhouses, trenches and the Fortified Trutnov Nature Trail.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been added to the list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's Port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chotěšov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-wing convent building above a beautiful garden.
Unfortunately, the list he got on belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.
But enthusiasts do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is another year of the Evening for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, the fifth of August, where Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas will perform, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of the beautiful large building, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno invites you to an unusual excursion into the deepest prehistory into the Stone Age, into the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with various extreme climatic conditions, especially with alternating glacial and interglacial periods.
Despite their simple material culture, they were immensely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn what they looked like, what was their anatomy, technological skills and hunting skills, but also their aesthetic feeling.
Wouldn't you tell Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth festival KELT & WORLD MUSIC takes place on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.

Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with the creation of herbariums and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they just came across on a walk, this application will advise them.
All they will have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also joined the project, taking pictures and adding plants from their surroundings to the application database with their teachers.
The newly created French application is free to download on the website The Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of the French programmers was to have as many people as possible contribute their images to the application, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Even children who can hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which it then assigns under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome that after creating an account, users contribute a picture of a plant that does not yet appear in the database to the application.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB's concerns about investment in McVitie's in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from managers of biscuit maker McVitie's of a long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow factory.
Scottish trade union GMB said the company had so far remained silent on a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 people who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the area over the past few years.
She added that employees and union representatives would be "among the first to be informed" in the event of changes to the plant's operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, Scottish trade unions GMB expressed their concerns that McVitie's "will not deliver on its promises to fund and modernise production lines."
GMB Chief Organiser Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the site manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan for Tollcross is very worrying to our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and the employees mostly come from the local community and Glasgow area, where working in the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social isolation.
In terms of work, wages and benefits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production – East Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "Construction manager Tollcross received the letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We have spoken to employees that, as with all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: "In recent years we have invested £5 million in Tollcross, mainly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the locality, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the local factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't allow in their bid to get Neymar on their side after depositing £189m, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of his contract, but did the French team warn Barcelona of their record-breaking shootout three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred up the waters of summer transfers. Ligue 1 are poised to more than double the previous record for Paul Pogba's move to Manchester United, who paid £89m for him last season.
Once the transfer is confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, earning over £500,000 a week from PSG after taxes.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has pulled out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club have always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was this fact brought to the attention of the football world three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs interested in taking over one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seem to have crossed the line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the departure of the Italy international under any circumstances. So it is possible that Barcelona are now swallowing a bitter pill for their audacious actions with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understandable rules?
Donald Trump nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not go on like this.
This, too, exudes the idea of sanctions like straw from shoes.
These things cannot be lumped together.
Maduro's Venezuela has indeed set off on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not behaving as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter unto itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up in such a way that even the ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, would understand what it consists of and what system of rules the sanctions policy is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only completing what President Obama has already prepared, he has just put his stamp on it.
So why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, he would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are tightening, not easing.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Is it like kosher are just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then the EU's anti-Russian sanctions are not kosher either.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Is it like using sanctions only so weak that they do not endanger anyone?
The average voter is groping.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he learns that it is about the EU's energy security.
The voter fumbles even more broadly.
Russia is being sanctioned for mounting too much where it shouldn't.
China is scolded for not assembling enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, order, or rules?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš gets married, crosses the country with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, it has already completed all the candidates.
According to his words, he did not interfere with them significantly.
He even agreed to let the Moravian-Silesian one be led by the governor and shadow minister of education of ANO, Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be an MP or a governor," Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You have angered many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors should manage municipalities and towns themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I believe that we should elect mayors in the same way.
In my book, I do not talk about abolishing representatives, they can easily be there.
The question is how many there will be.
During the presentation of your book What I Dream About When I Happen to Sleep, I heard with my own ears that you spoke about the abolition of councils.
I don't remember that.
I spoke about direct elections and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 councils.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is reproached for not building enough and not preparing large projects, but she does not have the competence to do so.
The same is true of a government that has been led by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
But the current prime minister does not manage anything, he only moderates the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to enforce a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to enforce.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a rolling mandate for ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members who are supposed to work mainly in commissions and committees, rather than showing off at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that is exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 deputies, abolish the regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and control the whole country.
That is certainly not the case.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction in the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French people per lawmaker, while in our country it comes to 17,000 Czechs.
But no one accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins elections in the Czech Republic by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the temptations for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such threat in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team that will work for the people in government, not for their parties or departments.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they outvote me and add 21 percent to GIBS officers, who are already taking 60,000?
Is that what you would do as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave wastefully, confuse the government with a travel agency, and would like to do business with state money like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers should not quarrel in the government, they should resolve differences outside it.
Ready-made material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition splits, power votes and deals, where decisions are to be made.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers behave mainly in a partisan way?
Above the parties is a constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply and kicked Babis out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has managerial skills, he has no need for such empty gestures.
It measures everyone equally and demands perfect performance from everyone.
Do you already know who you would nominate for Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't even be in the government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did so terribly.
So much skepticism is misplaced.
The mayors have acquired a businessman named Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, and the wing of Jiří Čunek, who is favourable to you, may win with the People's Party.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, while Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not be against it, may succeed in the ODS.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-Chairman of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura's SPD, for example in the area of the economy.
So the Okamuras come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims that he did not say it that way.
Mr. Okamura has his own political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he raised money from Úsvit for his company, some kind of coup took place there.
He, of course, is a distinctive personality.
However, somewhat brownish.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, one can agree with that.
I am not asking you that at all.
I wonder whether you find it acceptable to have xenophobic views, who speaks at demonstrations with the gallows and who wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering cooperation with Mr Okamura's party, I cannot imagine it.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the Communists' tacit support for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the coalition government's programme.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the state like a business.
But the government simply has to follow it, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything rot, he never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was the reason why he fired me.
As soon as he did so, ČEZ took control of the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ's management, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at the ČEZ General Meeting.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the personnel situation in the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm going to be prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with ČSSD for even better cooperation with ANO.
Maybe after the elections everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any lobbyist Pokorný or Růžička, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with this at all.
So answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the leadership of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to look up the statements of Mr. Schwarzenberg.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it has never managed it, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
For me, this is a trivial matter.
ČEZ is supposed to take Dukovany, value it, put it in a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition, or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear units is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are waging a permanent campaign against me, but I don't have and won't have any authority to fire anyone.
But to dominate, yes.
I don't want to dominate anyone.
I am just saying that citizens pay about EUR 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they do not really know how these institutions run their finances.
How come they don't know?
After all, the Chamber of Deputies approves a report on their financial management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the general directors of Czech Television and Czech Radio.
Look at how the news is discussed, at the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigative files and to Lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push me out of the government, which added a percentage to TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of the disruption of their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat to democracy posed by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek, is building a power base by appointing his son to the supervisory board of Teplárny Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state companies such as the Prague Public Transport Company or Czech Railways for his related lawyer Květoslav Hlína?
We have a permanent dispute on this.
I don't like it and I've reproached him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
Unlike the Socans, we never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was any hint of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this respect.
If something like that happened, we would get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
