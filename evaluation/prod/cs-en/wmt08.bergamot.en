Inflation in Europe jumps for food
Accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is due to the steady rise in food prices in the foreigner.
November price growth in the 13 euro area countries was above expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg-based Union Statistical Office reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the base interest rate with the reduction, along with the accustomed prices of raw materials and falling unemployment, leading to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2%, in the vicinity of them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must deter  inflation /9 disabilities so that it does not have to do anything on this matter later.
In Germany, November's 3.3-centre inflation is a 15-year record; in Japan, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent in the following.
Inflation in the eurozone has turned up because of soaring food and energy prices.
The term prices of the afterchild rose by 88 per cent, and the soy rate reached its earliest value since 1973.
Similarly, it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The price of oil on world markets has risen 52 percent this year, and last month it cost one barrel of black gold to almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from this year's 2.1 percent to 2.5, with the annual rate of 10.5 in 2009 to fall to 1.9.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation level in the next 3-4 months will remain to be around 3 per cent, with the average annual rate of 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The Fidesz group of supporters has grown significantly since the late stagnation as of early December, and is now at its source in its capacity since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists the Gallup Institute has never measured such a low  13% support.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference  would be more of a two-three (71paper) vote because of the sentences' sentiments of the opposition Oxadic, the difference would be more than two-thirds support for the MSZP.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament, according to the survey: their support for the entire population is 2%.
Among certain voters of the party, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has worsened even given the previous low of the Toe has never been the ratio of those who say the economic situation of the country in a very outright, so high  41 percent, while according to the other 46 percent, the situation is rather inner.
Families are evaluating the change in their material situation after the spring and summer's promising prospects, now in a more pessimistic way.
As for the coming year, more of the population is counting on a further deterioration in the population, and only a tenth of it with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those surveyed judged the most of the Gallup Institute's surveys so far, that the prime minister is doing his job to the best of good.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is believed or very much in believe in the number of respondents, while Viktor Orbán's share of supporters is 38 percent.
The PM is not trusted by 54 percent, the president of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister is to be able to be elected without a change in government.
While after last October's unrest last October, the government's tenure and the prime minister were elevated by a 35 percent so, the rate is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) the call is only seen in the call for new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characteristic that 60 per cent of respondents responded to a question about their eventual participation that they would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 per cent say that it would probably come.
For comparison, the parlament elections held this Sunday, only 55 per cent would certainly participate, and 15 per cent more than 15 per cent are likely to attend. The success of the referendum would be unmistakable on the basis of the current intentions.
condary would be told not 74, to the doctor's fee of 79 and to hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people surely promising their participation, then the introduction of the bicycle, doctor's fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth undercut by Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained last year's 16 percent rise in the price level with the difference that this year it was not at a loss for VAT.
Section for Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer knah of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs trade triangle grew by an average of 16 percent this year, with the price of all the hypermarkets showing a list of many over a thousand forints.
Jelikoň takers vy flew in food supermarkets numerically that last December, the percentage did not show up due to the earlier high base and so drastic a price increase.
It is certainly bleak to consumers, that what they might have bought last year at a price of under 9,000 forints, they will not do now for ten thousand.
Consumer's Daily Economy in the hypermarkets surveyed, he crossed the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The most expensive price for the horse was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 the consumption knail cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the native fish remained almost at last year's level, with the crute breasts, nuts and poppy seeds very much.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not feature the price of a product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the 2-litre Coca Cola in the returnable bottle was under 200 forints, so even with the backup, the product only cost 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the consumerist's skis, the Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to its calculations, the prices figures in the Napi Gazdaság consumer-based consumption cleaner raised by 15 due to prices last year at Christmas, while both Tesco and Auchan rose in the approximate by 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest, and this year's highest in consumer horse value was a difference of 12 percent, while the increase between the highest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In the forinty, the gain averaged 1,48,00.
The average price increase last year was at 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by the rise in VAT last year.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the department stores were evidently unable to decide how big the price range they should set for individual products, they went to the point of predicting the effect that the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the product's circulation in mind, it can lose a significant profit due to a price range adapted to the intensity of the circulation.)
Last year, the rise in the price of the consumer horse of Napi Gazdaság was so extremely apparent, the price of the most expensive prík was 1,720 forints not before 2006 at the most, while the cheapest price differential was only 844 forints.
This year the extreme difference did not show, the most expensive one the kňa now cost by 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest topping by 1,284 forints.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, it revealed a disastrous rise in prices, with fewer, undercut by the merge of daily consumption in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not entirely absolutely confirmed by the Central Statistical Office's data: it measured, in the case of a few basic foods, a price increase for 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, according to the consumer knaťa Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, rather expensive last year, showed price growth of barely above 10 percent, given the base and in the worst case.
The flour suppliers occupy their position according to their strong position when the egg suppliers, the drastic increase in prices they have also managed to promote in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trade gold triangle do not take a stand, they still report a good year.
According to their experience, more than one of the customers in the three-carereded stores are not interested in the prices.
They buy a lot of them, taking durable food by the salts.
On Wednesday morning, three supermarkets formed long queues at the cash registers, or the number of female visitors soared.
As we know, the turnaround is the turnaround in the countryside, multiple international chains to research firms, that the dudes lag behind even their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, it is eaten on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 cases of infection were registered in hospitals earlier because of inappropriate antibiotic-felling.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of the logs, the overload of the staff of the disease are not helped by the cessation of the disease, says the head of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, it also dozes on disinfectants.
Recently, the trauma department of St. John's Hospital was diagnosed with an MRSA infection.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in the man who came to the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place earlier in the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was discharged home, oily not long after he had to return with an infection of the MRSA and because of the bacterium found in his organism, one important surgery could not yet be performed.
By this year's 10 December, 1,094 hospital infections caused by the cyber-highway disease agents were reported to the National System of the Neocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, the head of the National Epidemiology Center.
That means that so many infections caused by multi-dresistant disease agents have been registered with security in hospitals, the others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methiciline-oxacillin with resistant golden staphylococcal.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is worn by one-third of the people in their noses without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well treated.
If, in addition, antibiotics are administered to an externally or inappropriately, it develops into a bacterium well responding to antibiotics of bacteria, whether it is very resistant to antibiotics and which quickly moves in inadequate hospital conditions.
Previewed, in the event of the temporary or permanently inactible functioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, a low body weight, or in patients in years, it may cause serious hospital infections, such as an early infection or blood poisoning  sepsis.
According to the chief medical officer of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about the MRSA infection, a similar infection is one of the daily practice in hospitals.
Inf.Infections must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there, Tibor Nyulasi said, k where the presence of the disease agent is not being studied. »
Resists antibiotics
These patients are isolated, the grocerial staff are shipped in rubber gloves and masked and have the necessary antibiotics to be treated, Now, hinx, Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first asked whether they are present in their MRSA organism, nor can the infection be avoided in the absence.
Sampling is not in vogue
The vast majority of the hospital infections caused by MRSA would be to be prevented, the current situation and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable for preventing the emergence and insistence of multi-directed agents of the disease, says Karolina Böröcz.
Jelikožží, this infection is characteristically found in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals recruited with patients should be checked and insulated with MRSA carriers in an instant.
The collection of microbiological samples by the bulk of the sheep in Hungarian hospitals is not in vogue.
This is also the role played by the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these odes.
Most cases are thus detected if the patient suffers from a permeable infection of MRSA, said the head of the epidemiology centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate antibiotics treatment in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
It is necessary to strive to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological embellishment should be performed, in order to prevent resistance to medicines, and to the hospital in all cases in addition to the development of resistance to the medicines.
The samples of microbiological samples are rare for the basic or outpatient additionally of the patients, told Karolina Böröcz.
etří sticks on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most likely to target patients through medical staff.
That is why it plays a very important role as washing hands and the use of gloves and a mask, and in this, the hospitals are manifested by serious shortcomings.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, and in the conditions of domestic hospitals it is not to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms, on the other hand, are often overcrowded, locompanes are often very close together, perhaps from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, to godly we could also encounter the fact that in hospitals, which are in an unfavourable material situation, they are seeing little of the disinfectants, there are few and patients a lot of things to get the emergence of indoctrals to the emergence of the indoctrals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are being maintained, similar infections are demonstrably less or can the pre-price of the disease be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
The treatment of the infection of the MRSA represents a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it is being fought against.
In England, for example, the government has written a programme to prevent MRSA, or a reduction in its occurrence.
The programme appears to be a success, according to the published data, MRSA infections in England show a downward trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities for the prevention of multi-resistant disease agents (by which also includes MRSA), or hospital infections caused by these agents of the disease, among their priorities.
Police captain, only to cause fatal accident, not drunk
The official expert report in the case of the Police Captain XXII. of the District, only that he caused the fatal accident, is done.
It can be excluded that the police captain of the XXII. district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who had resigned from his post in the meantime, driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, informed the spokesman for the Supreme Prosecutor's Office of the capital, Attil Morvai, on Friday after the case's expert report was completed.
The expert's report confirmed the result of the initial visit, which was stated to her that the former police captain had previously, not when he had been behind the wheel, had not received any alcohol.
At the time, the director of the Police Headquarters of the XXII. district hit his own passenger car in Lajos Kossutha Street in the XXII district while turning the 55-year-old man's turn in front of him while crossing the road outside the designated crossing.
(The latter fact that a pedestrian was crossing out of the zebra, according to the road rules, is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After being rushed to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police director resigned from his post and was in a stand-off for the transfer, according to the police memo, therefore, that he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being carried out by the adoption of the Budapest-based visitation prosecutor's office.
Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police captain had since the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors engaged in the posting.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
The three loan frameworks, worth a total of €400 million to support the university, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as in energy, was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of €300 million for Hungarian budget financing of transport projects and a more civil environment, implemented from the support of the Cohenda Fund, and the parties previously concluded a €100 million loan agreement, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
Thus, the budgetary financing of projects linked to the course of the business is supported by a loan agreement of EUR 150 million.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the use of the remaining €150 million to be brought to the request for later, with the breakdown of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract that will use the budget for the pre-seventory of the Debrecen University's research-development project.
The meeting was also discussed at the 4th metro line.
The parties agree that, after Hungary has agreed with the EU the details of the funding to the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
This, according to János Veres, could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded a total of €8.4 billion in 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest rate of the loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without commuting commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astonishing /1 .13 of Europe's attention is turning to the previously slightly neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys at the still cheapest, the sheep-lowering EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for property purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap skiing apartments and houses on the seaside.
The most in the course of the mountains are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoéa, and on the sea coast Albena, the Golden Sands, the Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozobol and Nesebar, and more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavark and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country will arouse the interest of investors and the central part of the country  for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna  and more and more interested people are also buying around the cheap city of Ruse.
The capital, Sofia, is also a promise of tempting abrasions, with business and office space promising the most viable return.
Bulgaria is on their best path to turn into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, making it a sought-after destination alongside the summer and winter seasons in the next two seasons.
Predicting investors thus buy it in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, property buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their own life and their own style.
Most customers come from England, with alias also coming from France, Belgium, Spani, and increasingly from Romania.
There are also Malttest and Cypriot investors, by the Black Sea and in the skiing paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are to be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settling people are buying either the renovated, 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for €5-5,000, which they then renovate.
They defer to the good accessibility and the power of communication, important to them is the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of the cottages (Bulgaria ranked among the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
The increase in real estate in the capital is uninterrupted, or demand is increasingly strong.
While the highest re-creation prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, they have grown by 21 percent annually in the last five years.
The listing of house prices significantly pre-signs in salary growth.
Fodor and Hungarian more than one percent
According to the Minister's information, the environment and water management, Gábor Fodor, will end the meeting of experts on Tuesday and the international conference on climate reheater after the official opening on Wednesday will continue with the ministers' meeting after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world are discussing the Roadmap from Bali, where they are pursuing the efforts following the period of emissions reduction defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, they are undergoing a fierce debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it now does not want to discuss the exact figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 given the 1990 level.
Another big question for the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, advanced countries will also accept the provision of both material and technological assistance to the countries reliant on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, set by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member management board, no longer under the World Programme for the Protection of the Civilly Environment (GEF) to the United Nations can we read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian gee-six percent
The Minister of the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the global climate protection effort and to help the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent compared to the 1990 level by 2020, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the Colhodhodhodian Wcareer Agreement, and is ready to commit to and 30 percent reduction in the event that other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, will be willing to accept responsibility and commitments appropriate to their duties.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set a target of a 5.2 percent reduction target, with the five-per-cent commitment of the top 15 EU member states to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, what our own fulfils.  is recalled in a press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
In Bali, it is a big deal, or two years, an international agreement on the long-term climate change policy is to be adopted, otherwise its entry into force would be moved up with certainty, and in 2012. In such a case, the commitments to the reduction set by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be introduced by the new system of emissions-mining, and its necessity in its latest report was also pointed out by the United Nations International Scientificology Forum on climate change  IPCC, only that it is the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This would lead to a time-reducing emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in average temperature rises on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British military units are publishing recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing site to popularize themselves with them.
First, YouTube favored the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces Operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera mounted on the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command to control combat operations in the Kandahar region and then be sent on to London, where they are broadcast on the internet.
Political message is inevitable
This form brought to the internet the 139 recordings of the soldiers of the British air force and their kanálūcomhūked more than 75,000 people watched it.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as defenceheadquartersamedified and publishes recordings from events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Teams in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The air forces have released the videos according to their original intention for the purpose of recruiting, and according to the Defense Ministry, they are also good to meet the orphan public with the real goal of the military's presence abroad.
The promotion published in this form is almost worth nothing compared to traditional TV recruitment commercials, Defence Asset Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, jawi, it necessarily also carries a certain political message, or, in a special way, confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made the game
The army is worried that, in addition to the carefully edited, censored recordings, are also receiving amateur videos, capturing the deaths of soldiers, for example: in a slightly hypocritical, oficialomicomomomomomic promotional films, the officers are talking most about the loss, the bloody form of the fight is not performed by the blood.
Indeed, many of the videos of the fights in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were made in the harsh deployment, have been made public by the British military of elective, and now.
The Americans recruit a little differently  using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to do the job, and in it the player can get straight into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have Christmas with raffle and pagnas
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she farewells and coffee with 2007.
There will be a celebration in some ministries with a rather music, elsewhere it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere of the officials with a raffle and a toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the Swedish table  is so entertained by the powerful.
The state authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and it does not expect its staff to do so.
At Christmas, the orphans will receive gifts from the children of the fallen soldiers, at the Mission Christmas, the family's associate of soldiers serving currently on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort will devote 25 million to the atmosphere of the year at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will kick off against the other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320 000 forints and an already set of employees of the Ministry is expected to be attended by three hundred and fifty guests.
The resort will be haunted by Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and there will also be a raffle drawn.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday at the State Judiciary Council (OIT) building – concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
The hall's lease cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to our next Christmas celebration: here the company will host the tour of the tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) with EU money.
To this end, they rented the Vígszínház Theatre building.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, we were not able to reach the next person.
Suit not needed
The OIT building was hosted not only by NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the Christmas Day on December 7 with the Christmas Day. Lucie.
From him, the OIT did not want the money to use its halls.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with a greeting minister, and after dinner it was possible to dance to the accompaniment of the music.
According to the answer to the [origo] question of the [origo] at the ball, the formal evening dress or suit were not required at all.
The Puritan Party is being prepared by the health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a program and a celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth is not even officially invited to the Christmas party, a low-key committee at the final working meeting.
It counts for a hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press office, will receive only coffee and pagna, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai, with his co-workers, will make a slower toast to the Ministry of Local Authorities and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas reunion, at which 436 workers are expected to be in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he dedicates 2,500 forints to a guest the total amount includes the reception with the Swedish tables and a toast.
Since he is Minister János Veres, the PM staff has been celebrating Christmas in a similar fashion year.
The atmosphere of the party will be absent, with official official momentarily amplified not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Ministry is hosting a New Year's reception on 20 January, with no ministerial Christmas.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Parks and, according to the Ministry's statement, is forged 1 000 fork per person for a hundred guests.
According to the press office, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the local foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting of the minister and end in a small delight.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Schools and Culture do not host Christmas parties at all, the current press departments told [origo].
The price of the resort's Christmas celebrations of the residential environment in the press office could not be communicated.
In a case-of-do event, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
He's in the face of a giant strike
The collateral of the trade unions of the League and the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ) will set up its strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
There is a protest public gathering on Saturday, on Monday  the day of the final vote on the health insurance law – work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause a significant break in traffic, because the airport traffic will almost stop completely and the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) employees will also strike within 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, they will brief the League together with the National Union of Workers' Councils with details of the jointly organised Monday's strike.
There will also be a strike commission of the LIGA  MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
There is a protest public gathering on Saturday, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if there is no agreement with the government.
This means that no end date for the strike to be followed, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance bill.
Should Parliament ultimately not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions would withdraw the call for a strike in an instant.
If, in particular, the legislation is voted down, the strike commissions will come together and they will decide on the next procedure.
According to Parliament's agenda for a meeting on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be put to the vote in the late evening or, or, as the case of the, night.
The start-up strike on Monday makes it possible to count on binding traffic interruptions: on the board, the work will be stopped for an indefinite period, in the morning a part of Budapest's public transport can be stopped and more than half of the companies called.
At the same time, half the lane will also be closed in many parts of the country.
The call for the strike was joined by numerous unions and civil organisations, their listing is constantly updated on the website of the League association.
Some organizations have announced a strike for an indefinite period, while others have announced a temporary halt to the work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Workers of the Rail (VDSZSZ) have failed to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people are travelling on the start of the Christmas holidays.
According to the current communications, from the start of the operation to the beginning of the operation to 13 o'clock the BKV will be on strike, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be held by the LIGA Trade Union of Workers, the Education Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators called for a 2- and 2-8 hour job stoppage.
The Union of Hungarian Physicians will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Trade Union of Health Workers and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Trade Union Co-op for Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The least of the four appellants formulated by the League is the League's association, to be removed by the government's proposal for a reform of health and to present a new concept for the public debate.
The second-in-view is to make the new way of counting pensioners valid from the coming year to be introduced gradually.
The third to ensure that early retirement for the relevant labour sectors be made more accessible by the possible inclusion in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Employees' Workers (VDSZSZSZ), under the trade union association of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning the mining branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has raised the country's risk
The work of the Hungarian Guards, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Institute of Political Capital, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
In wareness of the risks posed by the company, you will be writing: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the most political risk is that by the height of the south of the southern, of the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Romani population of Hungary, it may also take place in a short time, forcibly ethnic clashes, it may also take place in a short time.
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be aimed at provoking such an action  is being powered by a research institute.
As you write, this can be explained by one of the most negligent of the most negligent of the Hungarian political leaders: the Corporate debate on the Roma issue was left to the representatives of radical and extremist political groupings who could have built the political strategy on the Romani-Hungarian contradiction.
This deepens the problem, it makes it impossible for normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and adjusts the likelihood of violent conflict  the institute reckons.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, due to the great attention of both domestic and foreign media , largely spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, as far as faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturityom are concerned.
The institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been receiving ever more publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, it is that several organisations have formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which are called the National militia associations of the same as the National militia.
The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civic association, while they openly proclaim  and the armed  the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of lifeless disasters, the assault on the country, disturbing the order), in addition, citing the incompetence of the police, the military, or the state,ísís.
He goes on to note: this is done in a way that seeks to pack up various political efforts built on society's opposition to politics and parties to civilian robes.
The emphasising of the civility and form of the association, therefore, in the case of these groupings, do not serve only to avoid the legal pitfalls of the judicial registration, which is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor of the renderer of risk also in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, they have been pointing to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries, citing the creation of the Hungarian Guard, want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policy.
This should have an impact on the political stability of the area, he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
As you write, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The backdrop to the creation of the Bulgarian guard is mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
This was used by the BNU to establish the Guard with the aim of the organization being National militias.
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been an Ťcican terror in Bulgaria, the state has remained idle and indifferent to the elephant, recalls the institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As you go on to write, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is signaled by the announcement of some of the Bulgarian Roma organisations to create their own guarrise as a sign of resistance.
Jelikožžžžžil's activity of the Hungarian Guard has shown similarities to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not out of the question that even the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read into the risk warning drawn up by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director at the Political Capital Institute, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis for a year and if they find out something that could affect the change in risk, they report public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not all available
In Hungary, the days off are precisely set by law, and it has become a general practice for working days to move around the holidays, which is expected to be fewer times in the next year.
In the European Union or in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national holidays and non-working days.
Non-working days with most of the ailing time's commemorating the ecclesiastical holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and first day of the new year is a work day off  New Year's Day is there to be a chance for people to relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year, we otherwise have a total of eleven free holidays.
The National Day is March 15, celebrating the 1848 and 23 revolution. October, the commemorative day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, work on 1st and 2nd November, we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays, the Pentecost and Christmas.
Jelikožežžžžěžá state, national or religious holidays according to the calendar are rarely seen for the weekend, it has become a practice of moving the working day in cases that we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
The price for the long weekends is the one that we stay on the job and the other day in the previous Saturdays.
We will work off the day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday that the Minister of Labour has been knighted for years in a special decree by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to employers and their employing workers, to public servants and to those in the public service.
It does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, with a view to their purpose, also operate on non-working days.
This year, the change in the working schedule will be changed by the very end-of-year holidays: from 24 December, the life of the country will almost stop, or, according to the previous experience, most people spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve beforehand nap the time of the excuse or use the holiday taken in this way.
In the next year, several of their holidays fall to the middle, respectively, for the end of the week, so the rescheduling of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around the Labor Day so that the workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, 2 May, can be a rest day.
The next move is related to the Feast of 23. October: Saturday 18. October will be worked instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year of the year will be able to take place entirely in the wake of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost a nonstop holiday even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
est deterring the little things you have to find your colleagues
The e-mails we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, the innocent lens we hardly even know: this prints are all to be enraged by the 8h, the IT days on the work.
The question is whether you get used to these minor inconveniences or put on your gloves and open up to the vague situations that others may upset, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were being sought from the marketing department, you'll be notified by a colleague.
be sure you've blocked a rally for this?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot the message to be handed over (that's less common design).
Most often, a thing solved by one apology is.
Before, it would be an embarrassing excuse, it's a good idea to think about what you might be able to prepare awkward moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to prevent it.
Do you borrow something you're not?
There's nothing uncomfortable when you're reaching out for a document, an office job or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember that you'd laid your seat on the table yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table of a colleague your pen, which you were seducing for the lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be rightly mad at you for rummaging through their things.
Don't take envelopes or glue papers from the office because it's possible to be uncomfortable when you run out of it prematurely, and you'll need them in a moment.
Gossip about the private creech of colleagues?
There is no good desire to stop the touching taunts.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
You don't know about your report (humnies) about your personal chatter!
When one of them will share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lose what you have heard in yourself, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his affairs.
Are you unjustifiably reporting your absence?
If you call the office and, citing a strong headache, you report your absence because you are unwell, or you think you would rather rest today, think of the fact that you have work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain date, someone else will have to do for you.
Consider your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you don't go to work the next day, or something to happen to make you have to stay at home, report back to your colleagues and managers not being confronted with your absence and the next day.
Sprinkling, giggling, making phone calls
Have you immersed yourself in work, from which you are grossly interrupted by the giggles of a colleague?
Did you inadvertently witness a telephone conversation that would have been better not to have even seen?
Don't disturb your coworkers by humming, chanting, loud talk (to hers overhead), nor by stamping, with a constant cursing, loud discontent.
It's all to be exciting even when they're not being taken into any project (written, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for the mistakes?
If something is not on time or have forgotten to send an emblematic letter or message, do not blame for the forgetfulness of the other!
Don't appeal to the possible chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Admit it, if you have erred and someone has paid the price, and correct the damage!
Ask how you could put things right, correct the negligence!
Do you feel like you're at home in the office?
Warms and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, wear to the office are not suitable!
Don't wear leisure clothes, even if the profession allows it!
Don't be sloppy, greed to your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in the run-of-the-mill  and if it's the profession that preaches, nicely and elegantly!
When a person wants to suit, you stop being interesting
Poployment in the usual morning traffic jam.
From the radio, there are special tunes: the sound of the violin, to which the electronic effects are attached.
Add volume.
Music changes the tempo and the previous tonne-coding is added to the bass, then the congregation is attached as a real jewel.
At mr2 station, the song by the band Zagar, called Wings of Love, reads.
The domestic musical, the domestic musical, did not just spoil us with quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, however, the traffic looks quite different, because you are listening to the new Zagaru album.
The revelations of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from the domestic digital underground slowly change the overall picture, and although garator rock is back in vogue with its beating on the guitar, even the home electropop proves that something new is under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five-County and he also played in Yonderboi's band, and that in the end  he may have done so, that two bagpipers will not fit into one of the chicks  they went their own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to dig in, and when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
the film Ferenc Török Szezonomoom).
His formation, in the early days of the minority clubs, was recognized by its audience after wan2 magazineked their first album from 2002 among the fifty-most-most-leading home records, Zagar, at Yonderboie, for almost the only domestic developers that could be saleable in the West.
Zagar and his band are without a doubt v course at the course, although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The band responded to how it was: made a new, better album.
The now released album, Cannot Walk Fly, should open up new avenues for them, although the title itself is trying to create a continuity with the initial flights in the Five-Extie.
This is one of the verses from the track of the old band Balázse Zságer.
A reference to the éterchno, flying would be in place, but in addition to the ethereal hint of this music, it has now appeared in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time  the rooted guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the album's premiere in Millenáris Park was presented by singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle.
The album was also produced by one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music late from morning to evening, began to wrestle with the sweeping melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with the yorwegians of the 'Underground Divasomoach).
So all right (?).
Hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In the context of this new hit, the question is, how much is left with marginal music what you play?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of fringe music means nothing much to me.
I think there are two different caste of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it's just as much to be created just for the sale of what makes it commercial.
We'll also have a good pop piece to spring from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is accepted also works, independently of both language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, the day before we go to the west, the light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their 20s, but also the old.
They watch much more on the transformations of the light music surrounding them, because they also elevate it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where and in how much listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good to have more and more people coming to see our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen in concerts where mutual influence works, but this is hidden only in the elusive transformations of the moment.
Still, I've come to know that when you want to suit the audience, you've stopped being interesting from that point on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and he built his career out of us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how he does so, he does to try to explain music.
We're sleeping team players who rely on the other's musical presence and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was no way to avoid comparing our work to the songs of Yonderboie, either of which a few of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the topsy-tank-based rider of mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love came first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Popularly, in style, you have consciously opened up to the layers?
B.Zs.: We weren't planning to write a hit that we'd sell the record.
There's more to that song.
We snored it as the album's final, by which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and the essentials.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is  what was the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then he came up with the idea of putting together this choir from the soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So this six-man choir -  Sena, Edin Kutzora, Judia Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Yuci Németh - then rechristened the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Exactly like this, did you mend the song, or did the girls re-emplate anything about it?
B.Zs.: The composition of the night has existed for a long time in the instrumental version, when the material was then taken to the board, we thought that this song would be needed for this song.
The trail of chords was tempted to be joined by a singing part.
Earlier that day at night, I sang a tune that the girls later learned to do.
The whole thing came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it got weird, but of course it took the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that forcefully.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don't have a part of their own, they sing together and they're not loud when the music is not just a music that accompanies their singing.
They also stood at the back of the stage.
Is that on purpose?
B.Zs.: The one they were standing in the back was only because of the technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to divide solo roles is, on the contrary, intentional.
Even the piece is about forgetting our ego a little, from where, where one is, and to just let ourselves be wings, the wings of love elevate.
I wanted the others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composing of music, not really with one, the most dummy pieces occurred to you sleep when stirring.
For example, Dorian Graynoches Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rockifulenenplingor Goes To The Girls, where he did not want to function groove for a long time, then all nicely slowly took his place in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which track from the new record is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is always changed by the concert and the fact that I have released the I despised the album 3.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous broker risked billions of inferiority
A treacherous embezzler.
That is how the former employee of Jerome Kerviel's rampant is described by the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka.
She lost nearly €5 billion because of it.
But it seems more like Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market early.
"He's mentally weaker," came the mouths of his superiors, who had sent him to the police.
But, as Kerviel's testimony, carried out by French media, such as Le Monde, was a man who made €1.6 billion in profits from his deal at the end of last year.
Crises not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he claims in the statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros from the US crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
But the whole economy was not to be affected by this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit then climbed to €1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that it would not be discovered.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his dealings.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come to him?
More like no.
"I thought it was the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to take so much risk?
He had to work his position up to gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a self-sufficient broker with a yearly salary of $90,000.
Still, he knew he would never make as much money as anyone.
"I knew at my first interview in 2005 that I was being gnawed at me.
Because of my education and also for my professional and personal development," Kerviel described to the investigators.
But shortly after the onset came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares, Alllianz made a profit, as it was betting half a billion euros in the London bombings on the decline of the title.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make a living, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses knew, or rather suspected, of everything.
"As long as I made the money, they turned a blind eye."
But then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
He lost €1 billion in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who is not on leave is a broker who does not want to be looked at his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission yesterday, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to $150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will be increased by the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to be used by entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
In the current drawdown of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is still among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
20-year sentence for ex-president Nicaragua confirmed by court
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnold Aleman, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of this Central American state will return to the bars from 1997 to 2002 is unclear at the moment, according to the AP.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials to have Aleman served by his sentence at home or go to prison.
A court four years ago proved to Alemán that he regularly moved government money to the accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts were in fact his relatives and the closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Alemán based on financing his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved the budget
It is.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He went through for this year with the support of the ČSSD last year, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the bustling debate before the government's no-confidence vote, nothing dramatic was happening this time.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this traditionally overlooked, even most influential, law in peace.
It's a paradox.
Every reign begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government's power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more media-grateful and therefore pays much more attention to it in the media.
The guessing of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the austere numbers.
Government budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three ailments that the 2008 one is unable to resolve at the same time:
The first is a high proportion of the statutory mandatory, so-called mandatory expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits that were approved by the tacit "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM in the past year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the ailments of the first.
The third limit is public deficit, i.e. the budget deficit of towns and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
But the time bomb is the budget deficit of towns and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax, fees, and loans from banks, to obtain additional resources for investment, often recklessly issue bonds to take inappropriately into debt to their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other grids they received from the state in privatisations.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, which is constantly boasted by the CSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to get her public finances in order.
Instead, however, they were increasingly in debt to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were farmed much more wisely than our republic.
It is a huge embarrassment that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
There is therefore no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, quite unnecessarily swelled to gigantic proportions.
Even if some of the nonsensical populist spending approved before the election this year have been cancelled, if there is no transfer of the retirement margin and pension reform in the near future, then in fact any policy in this country will come to an end, and whoever it is going to be just in office.
It is with little exaggeration to say that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money for pensions and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the dispersal of normal spending by mandatory.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the last governments did not do their best in the last decade.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government, which realises that the state can only issue as much as it can obtain in taxes and fees, to the peace of preparation of other reform laws.
Only these will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly combat the crisis in financial markets.
This will bring more than $100 billion to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks are auctioning off the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $400 billion to the auction, and another twenty-four to make available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time following the attacks of September 11th that national central banks have agreed to take such coordinated action to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move is to address the biggest economic difficulties, a growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
"The coordinated action of the central banks reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to as fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion over defaulted loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect even more billions in losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what may follow when they opted for this course of action," said ABN's chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems like the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to the loans, they will also lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with the potential effects on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used for borrowing money in the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were still concerned about borrowing money with each other, even though the US, Canadian, and Britain's central banks had cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks' move will help withayge the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the US property market.
Klaus: Environmentalist debates are incredible
Global climate change is to do the most damage to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now been levelled at the UN International Conference on Climate Change to Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality is unacceptable.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president, when presenting his book, stressed that its topic was very important to him and was therefore so involved for them.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "often I only encounter caricatures of my opinions."
So now those interested can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that while he was not a climatologist, he felt he was in his opinion prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess scholarly treatises, has experience in statistics and is also a national economic.
He described as the main conclusions of the book the thesis that the climate is constantly changing, and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no match for the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not very large and serious and thus do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
Questions asked those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their utility."
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
Driver's license failed to be exchanged by 600,000 people
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to apply for the exchange so that the authorities can still issue a new pass to them by the end of the year.
But the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would take to the road after the New Year without a valid license.
Authorities say the card was not exchanged mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a yielded decline in interest in the replacement of a licence, the authorities in the metropolitan area are overwhelmed with applications and interest in the exchange of the licence increased this week.
The city's aftscast around 2,000 clients a day.
The queues are expected to be around half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
The new card takes 20 days to issue a new pass.
However, it is possible to request extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In such a case, however, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory exchange of a licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid license will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of CZK 2,000.
However, a policeman can also deal with the offence by arranging it.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will be CZK 2,500.
According to earlier information, a man who was not going anywhere could have been fined by the town hall.
He was also able to pay for 30,000 kroner.
The ministry previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a fine of no more than 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one is in danger of tens of thousands of dollars in fines.
A driver's license, according to him, is a testament for which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not an ID card that every person has to have valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driving licence.
Just take it or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
With the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
But motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to replace them.
The licences issued from 2001 to 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court cuts punishments for detectives in association with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
This was finally decided by the Prague High Court, which thus reduced their sentences, one by a year and the other by two years.
It was originally threatened by detectives at the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but he is only awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received penalties in the sum of more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of participating in the robbery in particular, while the High Court today dealt with an appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused dismissed the prosecution from the outset of the investigation, saying it was a trumped-up case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, officers of the police, after an agreement with Berdych, among others, handed over information from police sources, covered up individual robbery and helped members of the gang avoid criminal liability.
The gang handed over 30 percent from the loot for Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment is about the criminal activities of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, whose victims have often suffered serious personal injuries, but also about the abuse of authority of a public official and illegal firearms.
In the search warrants, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, a laser sight, or a submachine gun.
The gang, according to the charges, came to the robberies for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the nearly 20 men in the trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robberies of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still pleading guilty in court in another trial, some cases have not yet gone to trial.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomas Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child substitution bill: 12 million
For the substitution of children in the maternity ward, the lawyer for the injured families, Igor Veleba, wants to be compensated by CZK 12 million, plus court costs, after the Třebíč hospital.
For each of the mothers, three million each, two million each for the father, and a million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's attorney, Ondřej Dostál, therefore strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But to make up our minds about the counter-proposal, however, we need an expert opinion commissioned by the opposing party.
Let's see if it has any of the indicative value.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál pointed out.
The amount, according to him, should be between CZK 100,000 and 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňovo wanted one million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for the negotiation of the compensation expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motole.
The children's parents, according to psychology experts and psychiatrist, suffered psychological damage and stress in various grades and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by the men, although they were faced with reproachfulness that they had not prevented the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, find it harder to cope with the update of the trauma experienced and sum up the Veleba content of what is happening right now.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Perth maternity hospital on December 9 last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková to Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňovo.
The Highlands Governor, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over to each of the families at the end of October CZK 100,000 for the reimbursement of the expenses they were incumbent on the error of the Třebíč hospital being set up by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for the damage.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can apply for the assistance of the promoter.
The courts have so far awarded people relatively low compensation, with sums calculated according to the tables in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup loses Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the case against the brand name of the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the designation of the Wallachian King was first used, but the project was built by a long-term work by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívek's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone, at the words of the Wallachian Kingdom, recalls the actors and the comedian.
The same view is given to Harabiš.
"We're almost ten years behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"Years later, they realized that the project was successful and he could get something out of it.
They want to parasitize our work," he added.
The lucrative business
According to the court, the designation was first used by the Wallachian king in his television show.
It was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý in 1993.
But it was unrelated to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom at the time.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary event turned out to be a business and a lucrative entrepreneurial activity, which Harabiš then followed by the establishment of the Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to post his name and signatures in the passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only took advantage of the bald idea Polívka published in a mannequo for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted themselves to it intensively.
The cooperation of the now-beautious parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, controversies have begun to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the removal of "Kingle Boleslav I elected for the end."
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken up by the singer, at the instigation of Harabiš, by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was dismissed by the court today.
The clear could bring to the contention to Harabiš's forthcoming race for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
Details and the deadline he did not want to reveal.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
It should be like the King's Ride in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a period of time.
Even Mr. Polívka can sign up," Harabiš added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: vitiating prejudices
As a matter of fact, I've never been much of a Peugeot 206 fanfare.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the production could sometimes be described as below average.
But the market is now the successor to the Peugeot 207, and it's a lot better.
And the estate called SW is a little further along, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the head space on the back seats, for example.
This is the end of the complaints, because the estate car body means that even two-metre tall men will not suffer from this.
Flying the World
I'll get over the interior very quickly so I don't do too much.
This is a fairly good design where the only complaint I have for the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a bit more designer invention, now that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seat cushions or backrests.
The lateral line also improved significantly against the 206.
In terms of space, there is also a glimpse of the size of the bodywork.
In the estate, the aforementioned lack of space overhead disappears.
The tricarius in the trunk
The main one about this car, then, is his luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (even with the tilting rear window) and as a decrepit storage.
The deaf places are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are the ideal compromise.
It doesn't overtold, it can be stretched, and it will keep heavier objects in the process.
But let's pause to figure out the volume.
This is according to the tables in the basic layout of 428 l, which is more of an average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
Compare 207 SW to the new generation of teenager's product, then we find that Peugeot lags behind by a much noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a pram, this value is almost critical.
But if I were to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the floor completely straight down after the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
Our tested car was fitted with a 1.6-litre spark-ignition 4-cylinder with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-gauge one should look like to drive the family hatchback.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, it is pulling.
If I compare it to the damage-like, which sometimes feels like it has a stuffed rag into the exhaust, then I can only be thrilled with it.
Price list to tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a nicely equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a positive-ignition 1400 for CZK 329,900 will still be missed.
Our aggregate costs from CZK 410,900, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then throw in the outfit for an additional CZK 80,000 on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start-up, electric rear window controls...
The car costs all but one CZK 531,900.
It's a lot, but count on the extras at Fabia and you'll come to a lot of a similar number.
So there's no choice but to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils at British schools fails
There are more and more children from Eastern European countries in British schools, raising concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
Integration of Eastern Europeans, meanwhile, it has faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous people are escalating into violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and brawls between pupils were also transferred to parent-teacher relations.
The situation went so far as to the fact that in Chatham the police detained a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old pupil with an iron bar.
Guilty, she argues that the boy insulted her with racist abuse.
Police also had to intervene after the attack by two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly chaired the man with racist remarks and threw rocks at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to quit, he lashed out at us with apples and pears, and then he exposed his ass," the Slovak pupil's mother described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents even called the disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who headed here for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holiday, that can come true if you choose the right one.
Golden and whitewashed beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and heady cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea, you can find this in a complete and richer list.
But on one island you will find much more and that is the island of Cuba, the biggest and prettiest of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasury of treasures that the Spanish in America had flown and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially for Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among them.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses had sprung up in Havana, with cars on wide boulevards that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paulo, a short walk from Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, showbusiness stars were left with their signatures by politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls in Bodeguit, Havana, you can also leave your autograph.
The bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional will mix you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the '50s still drive around Havana, because the once-imported jigula and fiats in the salty and damp airs have long since rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is quite dilapidated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the area as there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
As tourism brings much-needed money, its development is the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially on Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more libation, which is unique in the world and is particularly appreciated by the trainers.
The thump from the sprawling plantations was brought to the sugar refinery on the narrow tracks of steam and motor trains.
Many of their car fleet has not been recovered for decades, so there are working machines, the contours of which are only in museums elsewhere.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba miss.
And so there's not much to write about Varader, or about Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway estate and those who like this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from limestone bedrock.
Mogots, limestone homolons and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has taken up in their hollows, which also makes stale scale-covered densely covered in the thick-growing.
The valley is the place where perhaps the finest Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can find its final form if you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
It may seem interesting to some that the Chilean work of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The glory and wealth was brought to him by the slave and sugar trade.
Wealth was reincarnated into the beauty and display of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that as recently as the 1950s there was no road connecting the country to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and that's why there was no shuffle, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If a person has more time than one afternoon at Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Castle Ancón beach, or the Sugar Valley.
The evening then belongs to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music dies down in the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the very east of Cuba is described by some as the prettiest on the island.
I'm sure the journey is influencing that view.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross tall and rugged mountains and pass through nature, which was hardly marked by human activity.
The eastern outpost of Cuba was inscribed by UNESCO on the World Heritage List thanks to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (it's actually originated about a century after the Columbus cruise) and from the hill, where the former castle and today's El Castillo are located, the table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron saint of Caridad del Cobrere, the saneriet, the African religions espoused by the descendants of the former slaves, many pages could be described.
But, as they say, see better once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few troops and the lack of necessary equipment influence the mission's progress in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
NATO, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should outline a concrete plan for the years ahead.
The mission in Afghanistan is not under the impression, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the mounting opposition from the Taliban movement, eight participating nations are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies today.
While the United States this week called on NATO forces to take more activity through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the residents to start the further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is the highest in five years, according to US military data.
The number of violent actions has risen by 27 percent compared to last year, and by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in the southern territory.
But according to the United States, the Allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific objectives for the coming time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar sense today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and the equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months about whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the combat demands for them are not as high as the combat demands on them in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers loungers.
"Afghan's deadbeats revealed: the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild went on the counter-attack and printed a picture of the British team in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debt to rise to $1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is over CZK 84,000.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget management.
The Czech Republic's national debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has fallen by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the national debt in early October.
For every Czech, the debt is over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state was mortgaged by more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could only surpass the CZK 1 trillion-crown mark in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly: "We could get to the top one trillion to exceed in the course of 2009.
Exactly when it will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene turned out to be changed, politicians would be willing to save more, it could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Debts rise
The national debt is made up of the debts of the central government and is created primarily by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion so far this year to CZK 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has grown by CZK 1.7 billion so far this year to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt year-on-year for the first to third quarter grew by 13 percent, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's wrong that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that it will do business with when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The strategy for financing and the management of the state debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget management.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the projected CZK 91.3 billion.
These are also planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency 13.3 billion crowns, a 10 billion reserve for the disbursement of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for giving a name to a teddy bear
A British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday night by a Khartoum Tribunal and expelled, as her lawyer put it.
The British woman was accused of having to let the redfish of up to seven-year-old pupils give the teddy bear the name Mohamed, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with a whiplash.
This 54-year-old teacher, who works at Unith High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebelling, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in reality in the month of September, when the teacher in question asks her six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"Four names will be heard from the children's mouth, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Muhammad," the school's director, Robert Boulos, tells us.
After the vote takes place in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children will eventually be chosen as the most popular name by Mohammed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very prevalent first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their classroom with a bear photo accompanied by the caption: "My Name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name on him, but the difficulty is in the very depiction of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim Muslim colleagues, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, clarified that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I merely regret asking the children to vote for a name," he said, it was merely a "innocent misconduct."
This is also shared by the teachers' pupils, who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that"s are not talking about religion in the classroom."
Recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most frequently awarded first name in the UK, with 14 different in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to honor the prophet (often the firstborn is granted).
However, what are the rules relating to the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
In the final round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach an agreement on status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to heed their commitments to keep to the peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a challenging period," he added, noting that "it is evident that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on 10 December
The Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their last trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, with 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population, could be shown in a clearer light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko, are to turn their report over to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, present the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika to renegotiate.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on December 10.
The Russians, who had earlier blocked Kosovo's independence from independence in the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution to the compromise," said Bocan-Charchenko.
A one-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance of the international community, the West sees Kosovo's independence under EU-supervised as an actuary solution.
The Pristina states that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on widespread autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," announced the president of the Kosovo Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where this "last-chance development" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and the provincial's future prime minister, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "is the history that led to murders and deportations."
"Domin effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still an option and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the province's possible unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominium effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the independence wars of the 1990s.
"However, this does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally possesses a veto right.
"Kosov parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"This negotiations took two years.
It must end as it began: at the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word on status will be given to the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would be done "by agreement" with the West.
Bush won a deal from Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened on his instigation, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-long dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do whatever it takes to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides that flow from the "travel map" to peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House official stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas are aimed at "a closetaining a peace treaty to resolve all hitherto undecided issues without exception, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees banished in the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of the present-day state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor for the US president, emphasizing the subsequent negotiations being "total and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, the border, colonies, the water, the safety, among other things."
Olmert stepped down to the stands, expressing his opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it was necessary to "shall be made to conclude in the course of 2008."
Bush identified the end of 2008 as a date for the realisation of his "vision of two states," Palestinian and Israeli, with the existence of a side-by-side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it made a commitment from Bush to this effect before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in return for the abandonment of all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially as it is fighting the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud reckons in an interview he has given to one Arabic-speaking diary with a patronized Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small messages from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car passed through the Louise-Michel street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on patrol and was passing at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, while the lateral lights were not switched on," the police source explains.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore authorized without authorization to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, was passing through "very high speed."
"The footman drove from the left side into the police car after not giving way to the right," clarified a policeman.
A blood alcohol level test performed on the vehicle's crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (a punctured front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) is indicative of the violence of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérès de Givra reacted very quickly, and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned investigating "unintent to the involuntary manslaughter and failure to render the assistance of those at risk," who is also taken by the direction départementale de la sûreté publishedlique du Val-d'Oise (residence of the Regional Police Department of the Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said the IGPN's investigation precluded, at this stage, the responsibility of the officers for the accident.
Three witnesses to the accident who were interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "a replay of the officers, according to the clerk, that the mini-father approached them quite quickly from the left."
A groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the cliphene on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedded until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles were secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of the two victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, talk of being quickly spread among the people that officers should have left the scene of the crime quickly without giving first aid to two young men.
The IGPN should have also, in all care, ruled out "any serious offense" at this point.
"It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more searches and with which you need to be very careful," the police source said.
The daily "Libération" met an eyewitness to the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows runs right where the accident took place.
"We immediately rushed down with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resurrect them," this witness tells us.
There was nothing we could do."
He then saw a "limping, a completely terrified policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth was speaking on the phone.'
In the face of rapidly mounting tension and the certainty of the youngsters' situation that the situation of the youngsters is hopeless, the officers were taken away by the car of colleagues who had arrived on the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the officers left."
They also performed CPR, but to no avail.
"Let no one say the police authorities have not rushed to the youths' aid.
These young men were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived at once.
Everything was done to save them', the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of exceptional condition by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken as part of an exceptional state, shear-big grenades were injured, which witnesses say used by law enforcement forces.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios to those in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court attorneys called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the Lawyers' Movement received the support of religious parties grouped together in the politically strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "crawled the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the exceptional state of affairs, and the garbage to those who were sworn in before Musharraf."
"Musharaf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is a direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election. October.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
"All of us are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the rulings of the Supreme Court," the official said in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to surrender to the leadership of the army and become a civilian president," he is not repaid" after the introduction of the exceptional state, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to be relinquished by November 15 when his first presidential mandate was ending.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has otherwise also refuted speculation in the country that the deputy head of the army should have ordered President Musharraf's house arrest.
More than a third of the pregnancy is still made up of pregnancy unexpected
This reckoning includes pregnancy unwanted (24%) as well as poorly planned or occurred in an unexpected manner.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study conducted by the French National Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the so-called adoption. Neuwirth's Law, which enacted contraceptives in France.
This reckoning includes pregnancy unwanted (24%) as well as poorly planned or occurred in an unexpected manner.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show a rate of 5% to 6% of the failure rate, Ined estimates.
After all, the enampling of contraception allowed for better "fat fertility control," the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptive in women between the ages of 20 and 44 was now up to 60% from the 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight births out of ten are now well planned.
One pair in five even has a birth calculated to be accurately and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most enjoyable year for the birth of the child.
Remarkable repair of space station
For more than seven hours of work in space, astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed a remarkably fix for the torn solar panel, necessary for the station's further scientific work.
It was a risky space climb that racked up records in terms of duration, the distance from the living-times, the speed with which the "clutchies" the astronauts had spent on the repair.
The trouble arose on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship unveiled the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for modules-laborator.
But these need to be supplied with electricity.
The crew's second task, therefore, was to move the 17-and-a-half-tonne electricity-producing module using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so as to be at its final post.
After moving it, the crew began laying out the module's sixty-seven-three solar panels.
And in that, one of the panels, decomposing like a lining accordion, as a result of the cable's pickup, was damaged on the desktop of nearly a metre.
The layout was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts who were originally scheduled to perform a control ascent to the ship Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to attend to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly to the end of the ship's robotic arm, added to the station's arm, and to repair it.
He is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very dexterous, has a very well-crafted chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "pork-run" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fastened a "legs" to the damaged spots.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the compensation chamber, as well as from the inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, the mini-hockey book with an insulating device to prevent an electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was invented and "after the DIY" made by the astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely laid out and then zinventarized his tools and returned to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the ship Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled to return to Earth.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing noticeably on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the air and defence industry company announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to face a delay in the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now €21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its projected production results for 2007 as a result of delays arising from slow progression forward for the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the start-up flight.
The cost of easing delays in the supply of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was valued "to €1.2 to €1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European designer EADS announced.
Because of these costs, EADS, next Thursday, at the presentation of its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) was required to announce a new profit outturn (EBIT).
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate would be six months late.
Recall that the EADS production results in 2006 fell 86% mainly due to the costs associated with the delay in another programme, the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group assumed that it would provide the first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's election will take place without a tense expectation: the Russians will overwhelmingly elect the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming so, after the end of a very few free election campaigns, their gravitationalency to stability, even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the House of Commons elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will tell voters on public-law stations a pre-recorded TV message, the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is expected to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president let nothing come out of him and content himself with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favourite subject during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for the honest, as private as possible as possible to the most transparent and open election, an election without the slightest flaw in the beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not nearly so.
They condemn the campaign, marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "never passed such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin."
After repression accompanying last weekend's demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, he continues to be banned from visiting, according to his a rematch.
"The Russians were left with the homo sovietica mentita'
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple tense anticipation, two far more open questions are drawn up:
- "Who will become Putin's successor in the presidency?
The official paper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates may be presented to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the almighty United Russia party, which will choose the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line of the parliamentary elections, as will the presidential election.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have been left with the mentita homo sovietica, he does not feel like the masters of his destiny," believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kohronov of the State University of Sankt-Petěrburg notices the more time-wise context: civil society has picked up, Christian to Europe, Christian to the country, to be Christian to Europe; the glorious common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed up on the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not accompany terror, but a certain economic well-being," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians are today "voluntarily relinquishing personal responsibility" that they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social classes, including the business world.
Even the clerical elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of the total 85 heads of the Russian regions) are governed by the local candidates of the United Kingdom of Russia.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Čerednichenchenko's conclusion, the 54-year-old professor: "Why think about it?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Weighted memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of the 175 million victims of the Hitler regime, are being opened to the public.
47 million archive documents stored in the length of 27 km in the long term in Bad Arolsen (Hess) were, until this time, accessible only for the "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of the archives - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratifying this agreement is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to be made to Bad Arolsen will allow to explore "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of the forcibly working," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, directed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were against making these nominated documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registries of concentration camps or the arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo were collected for the practical purpose of finding deportees or forced work underwritten by civilian citizens, to provide them with evidence of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent staff at Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsenen represents only limited benefits.
"Anything fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in Berlin's Technische Universität.
EU and India want to achieve free trade treaty in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already at nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are awaiting the signing of the FTA in 2008, announced by European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU Foreign Ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to begin negotiations with a view to signing the Caccords de libre échange, ALE with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already spending nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner in the order and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth trading partner of the EU.
"The free trade agreement will give spectacular drugs on both economies and "India will gain better market access for the 450 million thriving Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner clarified. The Asian and European giants exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in service" a year, Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, said this week that bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England took note of concerns and offered £10 billion in five-week auction
The Bank of England's Bank signaled on Thursday that it intends to alleviate the current fears of worsening again on credit market conditions and announce an offer of £10 billion in a five-week-attrack auction at a base rate of 5.75%, an offer in effect.
"In an effort to ease the concerns that conditions in the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and give banks more certainty about the way in which to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she announced in a communique.
The Bank specifies that £10 billion (€14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMTs until 10 January, at the base rate.
It seems to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally, they last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it "remains ready to take further measures to maintain the interest rates on a day's basis" of interchange loans at the same level at its base rate.
The interbank interbank interest rate was at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6.6%, the highest figure since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the English Bank, coupled with the fee rates, which discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation boosted by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many preferred to opt for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, the Union for the Popular Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the Socialists' (PS) proposals for the purchase of
UMP and Nouveau Clubs refused to discuss the various paragraphs of the Socialist Purchasing Bill on Thursday, which amounts to the rejection of the text.
The text of the bill came on the agenda as part of the so-called socialist "nest" (measured by the individual MEP's Club) and included a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the presidency of the PA, among which the increase in the employment premium was 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPP, traffic cheque or rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against the 115), the session was closed after a general debate that became an opportunity to exchange, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised appearance on the purchase of power.
PS deputy leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club would re-submend these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the Finance Amendment Bill, which the House will be debating next week.
The new festival is being born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is launching a new festival in Philadelphia, this Vineland Festival, in collaboration with Fester Republic, by the British organizer Melvin Benn, announced this promoter/producer.
"It is an honour for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," revealed Charlie Jones from the C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is the summer destination of the campers.
The festival is expected to take place from 8 to 10 August at a private 500-acre farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the festival, was one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also in charge of the production, licensing and organisational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of the C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspirational event" he has ever seen and says that his firm and Melvin Benna's company is working simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
"Originally, we chose Philadelphia as the market, and the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We negotiated with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, we are mired in politicking because of the city's current leadership, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, in 2005, after being excelled at the festival stage in 2002 by the organisation of the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvina Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green spaces in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way to create both the impression of a rural festival in Europe and the city's after the American."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineeland, including the mayor, is keen to support the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says, "that they are sufficiently advantageous to allow investment in such an event and to welcome the festival, which will hopefully have a long-lasting one."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Music Festival in Tennessee, which holds 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed at a time when the programme is only put to the press.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied there to attract a wide range of viewers as far as possible," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the final Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is "politically challenging" because the governor of the California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemns the "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into the claws of the "Guvernator"?
"You need to be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider the best," he said.
Chasing the festivals
For the moment, however, the priority for this is Denis Turcotte's promotion of the local film.
Already the hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they're festivals at Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing québeck films, drawing attention to them and making sure that the carnivalers give interviews.
The Age of Darkness was in good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short-form and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will the year on the market for a marathon? Experts divided by 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks left until the end of the Administrative Year, and investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, the experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "incentric terms, the month of December is a positive one on the stock market."
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially as, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, some doubts."
These experts do not expect the stock market to get moving in the last few weeks of the year, and report that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest in the absence of alternatives with guarantees, particularly of a fixed income effect influenced by the effect of averaging for quality securities, both in long and short periods."
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather calm run, not without volatility, "primarily because the impact of the likely collapse of the FED's (Federal Reserve) rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of incentives to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, the head of the BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that it is not the time to make a bold statement that there will be a marathon.
"There is not much reason to rejoice," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum levels recorded on 8 November, when the index closed to 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all the experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the reshuffling of portfolios and traditional contributions to the supplementary pension that occurs at that time each year.
But this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes the marathon will happen earlier, in the second week of December after the long weekend of the Constitution.
The analyst in question does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "so far as we could see the reflection of the index, triggered by US news about the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles to make it possible to bring Ibex to the new maximum caps.
The Intermoney's Solana confirms that "this year, it's the turn of strong titles."
This expert would include both big banks and some construction firms in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industry sector.
Construction firms will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been re-recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as the Ferrovial and the FCC will go the same way," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technologies will also do very well, even if they are not very represented in this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been in only two-month drops in the last two.
The actual marathon at the end of the year was held in the 2003 general year, when stock markets ended the crisis triggered by the collapse of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, with an increase of 6.68% in December.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in the ranking (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a major change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to make such a jump and to bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 8:30 p.m. and open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that also assured several times that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken a decision on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one in the afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for other players to join or not to join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of trade.
That is exactly the aim of the project set out by the Popular Bank.
To acquire individual clients who pose to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, business owners and shops from selected streets where branches are opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches in the whole of Spain within about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only an adjustment for existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial zones by adapting them to the profile of clients on the individual streets.
This is supplemented by an extension of the opening time by a further conception of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date, more modern design in lighter colours.
The Bank's sales director, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a major investment, but a greater recruitment of staff, as it passes from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with small and medium-sized company meetings and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
The branches on the streets of Madrid in Madrid were taken out by Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialized in immigrants, which are run under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.

Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 on the stock exchange for the first time
We did it.
In this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the executive chairman of Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trading, when he noted that the television he is managing had doubled the value of its rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I regret is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we'd fallen less,' he said.
And he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday by moving up 2.54%.
This profit has pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of this firm, controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % capital), with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4 488.88 million, according to the Bloomberg data.
Its competitor, Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% overall since January, is half the value of 2,19346 million.
The value of the other telecoms firms that have been valued is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million of Prisa (Pinco Días Published) and Vocento 1.779 billion.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered as we talk about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market, at what cost and how we rate it in the ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that this year it expects to become the first television channel by surpassing a billion gross advertising revenue, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that advertises the group.
If the forecasting data were actually achieved, this TV channel would see a 3.6% increase in advertising turnover this year, up from 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Anteneo's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (as far back as 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this broadcaster increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts target for Telecinco's best relative developments on the stock exchange is the increased pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, splits 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even if it is early to make the decision, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company, Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope to be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
Analysts say the market is showing some fatigue at these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco's profit, 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenen 3, its projected profit of 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves transposing of MiFID valid from November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings, which were concluded today by the Congressional vote on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has submitted to the public hearing the regulations that are developing the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
Party leaders have consistently highlighted the efforts of MPs and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard to guarantee investor protection and to regulate the activities of the entities needed for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which is governed by the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities PBS Committee (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advice services to be provided to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons, and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS) firms, financial consultancy (AFI) companies, which join securities companies, brokering offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of operations with financial instruments is being expanded by adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and command internalisation systems to compete with current stock exchange brokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment services firms to disseminate information on the market on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and the ways of coping with risk, and requires a statement of all operations performed to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
During the hearing in the Trade Chamber of Congress, several modifications were included, which are distinguished by the fact that securitised claims are considered a "complex" financial instrument, given the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the trans-conciliation of the directive was used to legally set out the functions that can be held by bachelor's bachelor and business management for business 30 years after a Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as the intermediary to work externally, will not require CNMV authorisation and will be able to provide product trading and client trading services for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its disclosure corresponds to the policies of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This pre-prisputed indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily have to coincide with the final figure, which will become known as on 14 December of this year.
"TheIS will continue to maintain itself at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the November increase of the ISC to 4.1% was a "sign of temporary" but also predicted that the price index would continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the congressional crossbench that "even if it is not a favorable figure," Spain's inflation differential vis-à-vis the monetary union has been "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government had not anticipated such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Economy Minister said on the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make €42bn with Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock, Bank of Northern Rock, had fallen into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
At the time, the Bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually fell during the two-and-a-half-month distrust of clients even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for that money and extend it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces the entity's name with its business name with its financial label Virgin Money, needs to obtain around a quarter of the revenue injected into British banks in the next three years to raise the remaining £18bn to reach the target of £30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for his striking advertising campaigns, is planning to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to make her resolution.
Northern Rock this week marked the offer of the Virgin consortium, which makes up three other companies, such as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
In the early hours of this morning, the civilian guard detained the current mayor of the Murcia city of Totana (from the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in the corrupt practices in the construction that were unveiled this week.
One of the town hall's secretaries and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People's Party MP, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who according to investigative sources interviewed by Caden SER, could have been the 'headquarters' of the business.
Officers continue to monitor the town hall buildings and the Construction Commission and no further arrests are being made in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer for Juan Morales, the main suspect in the construction corrupt practices that were discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer for the 'by-popular' MP, Juan Morales, who was being examined, was arrested as they left Morales' residence with important documents linked to corruption.
In addition, according to investigative sources, Morales's alleged collection of commissions for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that has been reclassified by 200 hectares of land are under investigation.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the PSOE's Telling Candidate and, if they win, preside over the congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General, José Luis Rodriguez Zapater, to head the PSOE (Spanish working-class Socialist Party) in Toledo in the next general election, he became the chairman of the Congress.
So that's what the secretary of the PSOE for the organization, Jose Blanco, and Bono himself, announced at a press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at noon today at the party's federal headquarters.
The executive's chief executive justified the offer to the former minister on the grounds that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He further noted that "yes, it appears" that this politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidency of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as chairman of Congress, who published his decision not to run in the next general election and leave his active political career on November 15 to pursue the fight against climate change in the framework of university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister kept urging him to return to the top politics he had left two years earlier.
He went on to say that, as well as citizens, know who the Deputy Minister of Economy will be, if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce who would preside over the congress in a "transparent form."
If Bono wins this job, he hopes to convert the House into "great respect and not swearing or shouting" and making it "more and more like the citizens."
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where there is no peace of mind to speak is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate was interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
He also spoke of the laudatory words to the current president, Manuel Marín, and "his good job" and did not yet want to imagine himself in his place, lest he stooped to the way he said, what his opponents might consider "great-migmicky."
Climate propaganda
Given that the anti-Citime Change Movement subjects mercilessly persecution both to those who view his predictions as well as those who prefer other political and social struggles to prove solid cohesion.
Moreover, to have a movement leader who is the prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal compels him to explain why his government's activities or inaction have made a significant contribution to Spain leading Spain in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening and why his government, the treaty's government, did not prevent it.
Moreover, this forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to hinder climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which population habits will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective ones, we will have to accept and what the economic consequences will be.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But we have not received such explanations, nor will we see.
Precisely because you need to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, genuine measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening both corporate and private accounts.
Even one centim of the petrol price, the proposed PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), found Zapater so risky in terms of the election that he was quick to dismiss it.
In other words, this is about saving the planet so that it is not worth nothing, pure propaganda, slogans devoid of any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And treaties with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that neither speak, accuse, demands anything, but is the ornament of the rhinestones and makes him tender.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contracting party and not asking for us to ride a bike and to cool ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained on suspicion of corrupt practices in construction
As investigative sources reported, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Muria city of Totana, "Secuver" Jose Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one hospitality businessman, on suspicion of committing crimes in construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located with a number of police officers who also attended the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the management of industrial land and flats.
These three arrests were added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to reclassifying more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to land suitable for development, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses there.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged in summary proceedings in the court of the first instance of Totana.
The six first arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totany and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
He was also charged with his ex-wife, the owner of the real estate agency, registered today in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigran (Ponttevedra Province) and Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which is one of the above group and through which bribes were handed out.
The investigation is carried out by the Crime Group under the Conduct Operations Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members carried out eleven searches in addition to the arrests, mostly in companies related to those arrested in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province Madrid) and Totana.
At the time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, and in the area a very well-known owner of a poultry meat product company who could have served as a facilitator.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with building the largest residential complex of the Murcia city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa."
The company received 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, the Conycase, which manages the parking in the streets of Coruňa, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (incidentally at the start of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18, on the same day that a critique of Blackburn's book also happened to be:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the town of Jokela.
The victim's assassin, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche's work in his messages.
Pekka E, the Education Councillor responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper's website that the professors take a critical stand on Platoon, arguing that there was no need to discuss Nietzsche in a mandatory basic philosophy course in secondary schools."

A colleague reports on the introduction of the crime of downloading from the internet to the Penal Code:
A. The withdrawal of one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
By contrast, if you dispose of a board in a shop price of less than €400, this is considered a mere misdemeanor (Section 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to €1,000 in a shop, the theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for the withdrawal (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for the download (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in the brawl than the shifts of the compacts.
Participating in riots has a rate of between three months and one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the replacement of compacts would be a rate of between six months and two years
(§ 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than the download of a film on a DVD, according to Section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punished than the provision of pornographic material to a teenager (§ 186).
So if my colleague is right, someone's hand got away from him, and that's a good one.

My attending physician is sticking one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that a month's paychecks are dependent on how much colleagues make.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using MRI scans on the CAT scan, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the Life&Brain Institute's viewing of the neurocognition group: "The biggest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrongly."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was modest, but when one got double that, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Applicant for the Balkans
The Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly persecuting the Balkan War criminals of the Balkan War from the State Attorney's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague for eight years.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the documentary film by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach was taken over "Karina seznam"(2006) in Spain, who follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor's work at the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York in the persecution of fugitives and pressure the states to draw the network.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance for a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense that depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, the type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to figure out what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This undertaking takes the form of an insurance contract stipulating that the insurance company will receive an agreed insured amount of a certain amount for taking responsibility for paying the damages in the event of an insurance claim.
The insurance premium is the cost of the insurance, which is determined with regard to various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driving licence, the type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely an accident is to be, the higher the premium rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and the women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies concluded that people living in a marriage tend to have fewer crashes than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journeys and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The rise in the frequency of the journeys increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies are considering when setting the cost of premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well to choose the kind of insurance that best matches his policyholder's profile.
We will show the most important variables here for the selection of this type of insurance, which, in addition to the fact that they comply with the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 experience different drawbacks, such as little experience driving and short possession of a driving licence when they want to take out premiums at an affordable price.
While insuring against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most consumers can choose insurance against all risks with premiums discount to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would presuppose a client's contribution to the reimbursement of the insured event.
"Part of the reimbursement of the insurance claim provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the premiums, which will be the higher, which would be the lower, the co-payment," explains Luis Noguera, the senior head of First Europe in Spain, an internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other operators by the client insuring against the damage caused to other persons, but not against the damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as possible, as this will affect your bonus and make it possible to reduce your premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate held by the insurance company.
By contrast, malus is an increase in that basic rate.
"The basket and the malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the twenty-five-year mark, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance, as the client's risk index is reduced, thanks to their acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience of the pre-existence when the accident is made, nor in the driving process," assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of proceedings, when the "fear of a newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered by insurers to be clients with the lowest risk-reality index and thus their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks at a discount of premiums (which could be €300) or a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their proceedings are calmer and their purchaseability is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to have insurance against all risks at a premium discount (which is €150) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It has to be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of a crash, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a valid reason for the appropriate insuring of the insurance options that would suit us best in view of our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to earn a point at AC Milan, which means the last eight
AC Milan and Celtic will gauge their strength this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an attempt to earn a point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the 'Champions' league' as it would mean being the first for the Italians and would decide the place for the Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured promotion in the fifth game with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but he needs one more to be sure that Shahhtor will not be ahead of him with six points to play with Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round is over, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will make their first start in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the tie-riding result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, even if both teams try to compete for a victory, as the Italians will not want to be in touch on home soil and Celtic know that after the win he would be the first and would secure a better place in the last eight.
The Gordon Strachan team could even be the result of a loss if Shakhťor does not win, but he cannot rely on that, as the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow (2-1) last week, will advance to the advance, but they won in the first straight game (2-0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who are confident of reaching the semi-finals in the reorganised Champions League for the second time just as they were beaten in the same match in last year's competition by Kaká's goal in extra time (1-0) after 0-0 in the regular season.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be Shakhtor, for whom he has the prize of victory, only if Celtic had lost, both to advance to the last eight and to stay in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no option to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert as part of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls launched their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20,000 spectators since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before opening their concert at the GM Place in Vancouver, they said that the reunion of their group was "great."
About 20,000 people bought out tickets to be present for a concert that also included a video that depicts the group's history, which drew a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and the world tour take place at the same time as a new album, released by EMI in Spain, and which brings a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo."
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice," British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though a nervous Victoria banned him a few days earlier.
Prior to the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that he "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she thinks of the show."
"Sports Spice," whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the contradictions between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness in meeting with the press two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the view of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the reunification of the group, which it had disbanded nine years earlier.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been settled and we all like each other very much."
However, a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the start, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by the Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival, the army of nannies was expecting them at the airport.
The five have a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (on December 4), and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
Fears of a new gas quarrel between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute is currently underway between Russia and Ukraine over the prices of natural gas, and so there is an increasing risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is driven by a pipeline through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two reduced supplies to EU countries last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge more to Ukraine, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economics Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments concerning the level of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has caused an overwhelming fall in exports to Western Europe, raising prices sharply.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large proportion of them remain underused.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must control overseas employees'
The insurer said the Scottish NHS chambers must improve the control of criminal records for non-European employees.
The recommendation from the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have a precise idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were done in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was of interest to the High Audit Office immediately after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in the morning for staff obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, the Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using video loads charged with links to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for working in the UK before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland for the review of criminal records, the agency has no power to obtain such information outside of Britain.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations that the commissions should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which help employers with inspections in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of the personnel's records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS agrees in many ways with its own pre-employee veto policy, but also added: "Our report draws attention to areas where the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information about the number of foreign staff."
BMA President of Scotland dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" to identify the pre-employee inspections of potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employee checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what the additional value the comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities reported that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher, too, because the commissions had difficulty identifying the staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the control procedures in place for the NHS authorities in the regions of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are to a large extent carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and pre-employee control directives for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health boards, would consider the recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best procedures were developed in the updated pre-employee inspection guidelines of all staff - including the foreign one - planned to be issued next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has picked up five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Film Awards.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn, and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell until the role of Curtis.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes of Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The awards were solemnly presented at Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis's journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards - for Best Director and the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning award - as the film by Julien Templ about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the Best Documentary Award.
The Plack for Best Actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Croenberg's Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard men, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming another episode of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honoured."
Independent film awards, known as Biffs, are awarded by a jury featuring filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bif proponents and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an imminent attack on the oil facility, as well as on the clerks and security forces.
State television told the largest oil exporter that one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the ground.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned to attack an oil-furnished oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000 rapid response unit to defend the facility since al-Qaeda's failed attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in the Abqaiqu in 2006.
The story cited the Ministry's internal statement: 18 of those arrested were among the cell led by a "rock-launch launch expert" that slipped into the ground.
She also said that the militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join the al-Qaeda militants fighting the allied forces and the US-backed Shi'ite government, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider hea.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - supported by appeals by al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - have focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and power equipment.
"This war has been a tremendous effort by the security forces in the past... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
Also arrested was a 16-member "media cell" in Medina, which aimed to promote "Sortfi's thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as unbelievers and renegades.
Among those arrested were also 32 people charged with providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a look at the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live in.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more like the willful twin of Earth than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's next planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbiting similar pathways, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions were similar to those on Earth on Venus and could have been habitable.
But the stamped greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower rate of rotation sent Venus along a very different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead, and it is ravaged by storms and hurricane-multiple winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express space agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a modest glimpse of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford physics department and one of the leading Venus Express mission heads said: "It's becoming increasingly clear as to why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, even if the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police detain "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (£440,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for the presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to the video and passed them to the candidates for broadcasting.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the other side's debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party to vote next year.
It is unclear exactly how the CNN producers, one of the debit sponsors, selected clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the strongest Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the puck around when they heard something gratifying: the broadcaster noted the peaks of approval when the candidates talked about a hard-hitting approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who popped up in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as Mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two struggled particularly fiercely when questioners asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Secondary candidates, like Duncan Hunter, California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to throw their little into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in play for perhaps starting to sound the alarm about immigration earlier and more strongly than the others.
At least immigration, the candidates have roughly the same view: greater severity at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, with fears of poisonous toys from China and other worries with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimise the divide between the libertines and the Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani has been asked why he has supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word from the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the view that even though the Bible was his favorite book, he probably didn't literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all odds in the first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was unpleasant but necessary.
Under the pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning laughter.
The contest remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent successes in raising the money and the loud cheerfulness of Ron Paul at Wednesday's debate.
These two have rebounded because both wings of the party still cannot agree on the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the winning news of American Size on the lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from ambiguous.
Paints of the Labour
Gordon Brown found a trap again that he might fall to; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
There don't seem to be any orders being sold, no bills at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid for, no extramarital slopes have been sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown could have done without being discovered that a wealthy businessman had masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party for four years under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling for the election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision had not been influenced by the polls, there was hope of a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being the increasingly hilarious deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, the once-gared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The harsh rescue of the troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in the proceedings and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend the tax code brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative bungling.
The retired three of the generals set off a rebellion in the Lords' House; they protested against the cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are multi-faceted gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary General (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inexorably heading for his or her end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point, which they find to be heavy for governing.
The people don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually push back their mistrust when a new crew takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is unlikely to improve, nor may he be in office for long, this is a relegation? The civil service is becoming leaky, ministers start making briefings, the press looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, as he cannot take up the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the Northern Rock problems and the records of the IRS are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown has made as Treasury Secretary.
And while he was not directly involved in Blair's trouble, such as the long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "condematures for money," voters may well conclude that he was.
Still, Mr Brown's predicament is not as bad as they look.
The blunders are not as gruesome as the Conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was downright deceived.
And the treatment, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of the big political donors are clear, and they exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who might buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams's progress but didn't know he was illegal, would be thoroughly interrogated; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the Labour's chief money-growner who had learned of the tricky gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, although the bulk of the payments took place after he took office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaching for a well-established instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - conducted in addition by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, this is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding the permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and to cede with a real reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour, who are in dire straits, to co-operate with the Conservatives and perhaps to give up their special financial relationship with the unions - the bitter pill for a committed party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives are now well ahead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to earn a victory is to unmistakable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the lower-price mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally, the dorsal fins begin to pass around excitedly.
Now, as the US real estate market languishes, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that credit card losses, if other consumer credit options were contracted from sub-prime mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
Signs of tension are clear.
The number of default cases of repayment is increasing (with more than 30-day payment delays) and written-off accounts (bills that the provider considers to be unenforceable).
HSBC reported last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also because of insolvent credit card loans.
But it is still early for panic.
The accounts written off and the inability to repay are still scarce.
According to the Moody's rating agency, the 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating measurements can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 change in the US Passenger Rough Act led to a sharp drop in the number of reported bankruptcies that do a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciation) would therefore rise, regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate that shows how much consumers repay a month from their debts.
And trust in securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of the structured finance sector.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their emissions volumes for 2007 will be 25% larger than last year.
Direct routes to spread the infection between the downward mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when loans for equity are dries up, consumers are more likely to go into debt through credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, are more likely to view cash flow than the value of the voucher items, so the falling prices of the houses do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be advantageous for the lenders.
The incentive for consumers to repay mortgages falls when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt is moved upwards into the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the price of guarantor items.
"It's not like we're just about to rethink all the loans one-eighth morning," says Gary Perlin, financial manager at Capital One.
While the risk of an outburst in the style of inferior mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt cuts will push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud associated with former Enron financial manager Andrew Fastow changed their testimony on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially guilty of seven fraud charges, when they and Fastow were to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- to be enriched at the expense of their employers -- denied.
They were due in court in January.
However, during a court appearance before US District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to a fraud.
The case of these three former executives at Greenwich NatWest, a Royal Bank of Scotland Group's unit PLC, has been on the front pages for the two years to be issued.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of an investigation into the begun after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The allegations against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that the government's investigation into the collapse of Enron had been the target of the government's investigation.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWestsk Three" -- claims to have come to Houston in 2000 to plot the scam with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner, a partner in Fastow, controlled by Fastow, an architect of a multitude of enron fraud that nudged Enron after a spasm of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch with a zero, but our three Britons knew it was in fact of considerable value.
Under Kopper's control, the company bought the bank's stake in the branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper for a stake in the company $250,000.
According to the indictment, Fastow misleadingly informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in that Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But the 20 million were actually for the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper, and others were up to about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two instances of conspiracy to play his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one months at the facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were on the loose on bail of $1 million, which ordered them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, the country's seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, no longer being able to hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay, and former senior senior executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their roles in the company's downfall last year.
Skilling is in the execution of more than a 24-year sentence.
Judgments over Laya for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient fuel volume for non-stop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is a little bit of return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in that many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of spectacular consumerism in the mammoth showroom on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping that the newly-Granized Russians would lure in everything from the mahagon-inhit yacht to diamond-encrypted car bulkheads that would not be ashamed of even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked cautiously at the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's nickels and dimes against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private airline market."
Money pours into the Russian capital on oil waves, just as it did when Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got immensely rich and marched to Europe, where they were looked at as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spendthrials of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their installment on this Klondike.
At another site in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference of Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernardo Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH Group, drew on ideas about how to sell expensive goods at markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.
Russia, according to the list of the richest people, has 53 billionaires with a total investment of $282 billion.
In addition, the local chief institute in the Center for Economic and Financial Research published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "secular" millionaires in Russia, with a total of $670 billion in assets.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians were living below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, the sales and marketing representative of the London jewelry store, David Morris.
It was at the fair for the first time, along with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed, and the men are all for a fortune."
Walking through the halls in the evening dresses on Sunday night, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana, five years her senior, Turosova, identified herself and her clients as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who was wrapped in designer clothing as a red carpet veteran next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a home-grown puťka.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the fresh upstarts, designer Russian buyers who are willing to sit out for several hours in the roadside traffic to walk around the warehouse, which the Cadillacy Escalade, the platinum fish, the Mövenpick ice cream, the custom-made poles, the Dubai apartments, the Gund plushers and the draught.
Members of the ordinary public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57.
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stall of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting from hand-painted blue tiles in size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in the facade."
Indeed, the shopkeepers here say that the Russians with the old money (according to the Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have moved from the glittering logos to the little-known brands of limited editions that would never have been shown at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, emissaries, millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls day after day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, said he had sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, interspersed with gold threads, after $70,000 each.
Also, on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, told the A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, that his company sold the clearly orange Porsche for $17,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, which, on request, is editing luxury cars, that he has sold three bars to cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed the reporter a car's bicycle designed for the casino's Russian owner, which had a brush-covered Swarovsky crystals to look like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather bikes or a portrait of his cubic wife from a cubic zirconium doesn't have to ride on those bikes yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"They'll put them in their garage of thirty to forty cars."
While many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" at the moment was not much exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of the local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least feigned wealth at a stall run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which is engaged in asset management.
The company erected four red British-style phone booths stuffed with a column of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed out 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaire Trade Fair.
Passers-by stopped by squander around a bunch of money, or be photographed by their friends with their mobile phones, resting in the middle of a spare richer wealth, or simply stuffing a pocket for a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey possibly caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local O restaurant a soundlier and watched an ambulance that had arrived at a white New England home two houses upsted by West Scott Avenue.
Soon, a police patrol car joined in.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's delivery arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, the executive assistant director of the Newsaub Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Miss Arroyo's death, and they hope that the toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help resolve the mysterious death that sent out a wave of sadness to the leadership of the New Arma police.
Miss Arroy was assistant to the police officer, Garry F. McCarthy, since September of 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough, and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroyo in a phone call on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me."
Mr McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newryan police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Inspectorate, and that he was leaving behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and her stepdad.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the State Attorney of the Union, Theodora J. Romankowa, she said the detectives were trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died from an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one possibility," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m.
November and found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little of their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh did not say if the authorities had interviewed Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a damaged pink bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" was on the table in the open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On the hooks on one side hung two mountain bikes.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo had given him invaluable help to chew through the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"You said, 'You'd better watch out for this or this,'" he said.
"She'd always be here when I came in, and she'd always be here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that Fed cut interest rates leads to world stock markets boost
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to soothe lending terms by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by the reassuring remarks of the Vice-Chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
The stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernanke, told the Fed chairman that responding to continued pressure in the financial markets, the guiding factors must be "flexible and pragmatic."
As a staunch effort to calm the irritated markets amid indications of a resurgent credit effort, Mr Kohn said that the recent excitements "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and in October."
He also said that if increased instability persists, the possibility of lowering financial conditions for households and businesses will deteriorate further will be increased.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital benefits to US markets, and possibly further interest-rate cuts to US markets, to stabilize credit terms.
These remarks also helped reassure Wall Street amid more bad news about the US economy, with housing sales in October at record lows.
The consequences of the financial swirling were underlined by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, 4% of its world's workforce, in order to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the failed bet on providing inferior housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE 100 index was up 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, closing to 6 3062, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent, and France's CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets became apparent in full force after the auction of the European Central Bank's three-month money-making packages were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release above-standard money on London's money markets has been increased, with rates on three-month UK interbank loans "Libor" rising to their best since the end of September - 6.59 per cent after uninterrupted growth from 12 November.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be number six at bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who has to make that decision?
The second question is therefore relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the committee's collector, who holds the post at best in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, the decision-making to help, and because Hugh Morris's desk, the England team's chief executive, is starting to fill in with applications for the post of national collector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
Whoever is not put on the bat for the sixth place at bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is no longer fair.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets through a lower level, sometimes because of lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is challenging and requires a report that always has to be subjective in the end.
Is it right to get Bopara moving up?
It's fair to Shah if it is?
We might be asking the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both of the smart young executives with a good education and an overview of the field, should be promoted to the commission - the place is only for one.
Who is to say which level is right for cricketers, if you have no chance of dropping or swimming on the next one?
Naturally, the numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but so do the opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer has to catch the captain's view at the right moment to take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances in starting positions, if he should ever make the impression of a one-day cricketaker.
Capturing the collector's view is more complicated.
Last season, for example, there were many better ones that James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artillery man.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first grade at 33 sketches each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same meagre average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for more.
Whether he plays at the Asgiriya Shah stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may launch or reach the careers of both, or it may not have much of an impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth played Batty in every Test and performed well in the first grade, five wickets and 40 consecutive holidays, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time was fighting for his job, who eventually became a stable Test cricketaker who is, although he scored twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia, perhaps still underrated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in the wake of today's training session at the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful buoyancy.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 3200 in the first class, compared to the six Bopar, who is, at 22, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, only ten runs, and that, together with the immediate rejection of the selectors, when Vaughan wanted to re-run him for the next game, his launch seems to have taken something from the vigor that was so evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Espsex All-Star has joie de vivre in the bones.
Nothing beggars him at the cricket field, and his behaviour off the pitch is symbolized by a four-wheel drive overturned car-based car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-fast shear pitching on the local playgrounds, which seem to suit him, give out effectively and bathe with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to get Bopara's chance now, which I'm not saying is that Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it's he who's going to play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria started arriving in Baghdad yesterday, spilling out refugees who had run out of money or expired in the period of visas, and others who hoped the city was returning to a normal life.
Some even returned to fight with the militants who had driven them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy of a dozen buses, filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubayas, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the papers because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to abort the fight.
Kassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amaria called in calling him, saying that the local militia, with the support of the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaida out of its positions in the west of the capital, urging him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, a few friends called me and told me that he was launching a militia against al-Qaida in Sleikh, and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said to Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attraction of reassurance in the capital following the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local "groups of biased citizens" who, with a gun in hand, defending their neighborhoods at the side of the US military.
But there was more talk that they were prompted to return by obstruction around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced the suspicion shared among the refugees that Nú al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
The partial reason for weakening the violence is that Sunnis were forced out of the Shiite regions and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will once again fuel sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Tiny Saronia, good education
Germany's smallest federal state plays a leading role in vocational training, excelling even by the international focus of its universities.
In only one educational field, the same shortcoming of the rest of Germany is concerned about Saarland.
"I explained to a man who does not come from Saarland yesterday that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears in the Saarland posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarek education system, which is in fifth place in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Traditionally, colleges have co-operated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Which is the proportionally high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of Sarian children are admitted to the college - many of them without studying at the grammar school.
"A professional education system is being used in Saarsk," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's educational expert.
By more than one in five juveniles, more than one in five juveniles is licensed to study in a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany, given the population.
Despite virtually-oriented training and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Sari's Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for the engineering sector.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have conducted several reforms at general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
For children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of the nursery school is free - a model taken over by other federal states.
If the pupils' results improve significantly, future comparative studies will only be shown.
In conducting the Pisa study in 2003, the share of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of Saarland, the Pisa study does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Saarland could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools - even if the people of Saarland are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
The hours in Venezuela are about to go differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will take the hours in this South American country back half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figurehead.
The official Venezuela newspaper reported that the clock would shift by minus four and a half hours under the new law compared to world time.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the US, justified his decision by, among other things, by imposing the world on the division of time-zone for the entire hours.
In addition, on Wednesday, local time, Chavéz announced that he was severing relations with neighboring Colombia over the hostage case.
This left-wing nationalist has said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't help but for my self-esteem," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision "spit in the face" of Venezuela, criticizing Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone has caused a stir here: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you already quiet?) - that's a sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the internet.
It was said by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was so upset by the resounding remarks at the recent Ibero-American summit by this left-wing populists to silence him in this way.
Germans face lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, this year, German employees are at risk of lowering the real wage despite a strong boom.
Experts justified their pessimistic forecast with a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007, employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower wage than last year.
"Money is to pay for the small pay increase, the increase in value-added tax and price increases for food and energy," Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) told the Bild daily.
New charges for employees may also be in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of the unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% was the right and sensible for the new year.
However, the Federal Employment Agency would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties again to have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Maltese, the newspapers of this social democratic politician quoted him as saying.
On Tuesday, it was disclosed that a price explosion of food and petroleum products drove inflation to its highest level in the last thirteen years.
Overall, prices rose three percent in the year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth
Despite its life, the hostile atmosphere is more similar to Venus to Earth than previously assumed. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomena that also appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind venues at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has produced evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning between the cloud and the cloud flies at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in the Nature Science Magazine.
According to the known theory of the formation of primordial mass, life could have been created on Earth by lightning. The storm reportedly provoked reactions in the oceans that led to the emergence of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
It wasn't like that on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there would hardly be anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500°C.
"Henwe may be the Hell's twin of the Earth, but he's a twin," Russel said.
Why the Venus, which is so much by matter and size, began to develop in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the Esa mission.
Since no probe has been launched since the early 1990s solely for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in research on this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which were approached by several articles in the journal of the journal, did not just emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind whirlpools at the North Pole, the scientists found a cloud-based vortex at the South Pole that spins significantly faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the aerial currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Instituto di Astrofisica institute Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is made up of almost the same matter as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, referred to as the Greenhouse or Evening Star, or the Evening Star of the Sun will orbit in nearly 225 days.
But it rotates around his own axis much more slowly. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although the Venus with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar (abbreviation for the bar?) It does not resemble the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Both had the water piled up. On Earth, however, she remained in the oceans, while she evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to Earth in carbonates, it is the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for the end of the party's controversy over the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany's reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the feud surrounding the acceptance of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves outwardly as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
While the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this has not prevented him from defending Merkel when she has been blamed for creating a new policy toward China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not dropped the traditional policy of a single China.
China knows that, too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly made clear of his opposition to the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the Coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "demonstrative" foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the acceptance of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao emphasized China's position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located in China, is attempting to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that erupted in France
Street fights with the police, gunfights, torched cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrest that erupted in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not escalate into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior urges.
Barricades were burning, rioters shot at the police with shotguns. After the major riots of juveniles in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also concerned about a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful that we also do not develop the kind of social tension that erupts into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Hanover newspaper, Neue Presse.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with a quick change in social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to fix the problems, Schäuble said.
This does not just mean the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit on Integration to the conference on Islam, we have had our first successes."
Prudence, however, is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs were not comparable to those of the French.
Over the past nights, juveniles and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been fighting harsh streetfights.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of the "imitation effect."
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who are from a migrant family, the unemployment rate is "above rate high."
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of learning opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We must give the juveniles hope."
But the president of the Turkish municipality added that there is more social control of families in Germany, unlike in France.
Moreover, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "Nevertheless, we must pay attention."
We must "fastly allow the young to start work and educate themselves."
Meanwhile, the night remained largely calm in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were deployed, and a helicopter was flying over the area with a headlamp.
Authorised authorities reported three arrests and several littered wastebaskets and cars.
Since yesterday, the quiet has been taken care of by approximately 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
In riots in the outskirts of the Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured overnight Tuesday.
The following night, the riots of Toulouse were engulfed.
The messfire was sparked by Sunday's car accident in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the prosecution, the police are not to blame for the juvenile deaths.
In the Reich of Angela, "Guilt"
The chancellor's reality is documented by the distant outing that the coalition is programmatically at the end, and that we cannot expect anything more from it either.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferently sounding and content-poor-poor appearance at the General Debate's General Debate, we must state: not here - not in this country, which, after all, that she should administer.
On the reproach for being too concentrated on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once responded with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she didn't want to understand what the critics were up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved that reproach.
There was no real interest from Merkel, let alone a flair for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela presented herself with "Clouds": a politician who excels at the others who are fleeing into foreign policy and, even there, expresses herself only vaguely.
Climate protection, for example: it is constantly being praised for the conclusions of the Heiligendamm Summit, but it no longer says how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such a self-claim - so immodestly, the CDU president would have forgiven herself two years ago.
It is now confined to idle phrases that could make it more popular among the people.
With this approach, it damages her imij pragmatists, who do not need to be flattered because he solves the problems.
But in the Reich of Angela, the "Clouds" are a marginal issue of internal political problems.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
A few by-end sentences were left to these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is recited when it comes to child benefit.
Three times Merkel has to start from the start to speak at least the correct sentence.
Once things get too specific, it stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of the Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates' Youtube in the case of the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney has sparked a fierce debate - and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already reflected in the first topic.
Mitt Romney is throwing his rival, Rudyo Guilii, for making New York a "sanctuary for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp remorse: "I believe that his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, grooming to former Governor Massachusetts for privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates are on the attack. With the Republican base not yet in clear front-runner, eight presidential candidates are using these CNN debates mainly to discredit their rivals.
The half-minute, internet-based user-movie-based and video-language videos only serve as such clues to the key theme.
"Exactly as a policy of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain pre-empts on his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one advocating for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain spares no expense for his reproach, or to refusing to denounce the tortuous method of interrogation called "Waterboarding" in which the heater is simulated.
Response of the audience in St. Petersburg show that the important topics of the campaign include neither the war of Iraq nor the torture methods.
The audience breaks in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
That will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains contritely, asking the party base and the TV audience for forgiveness for being in favour of submitting abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civvies for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, the Pakistani ruler, Musharraaf, took the presidential oath of office.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
The president of Pakistan, Parvíz Musharraf, took the presidential oath of office on Thursday, staying in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live on a ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the Constitution and seek the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to the commander-in-chief of the army to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani, undergoing international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his withdrawal from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Chief Public Prosecutor Mintik Mohhammad Qayyum, Musharrah will abolish the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the West's demands.
The country's Supreme Court, which took the country's opposition after the state of emergency was declared in early November by its inclined lawyers, rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the head of state 6 in the past week. October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
A spokesman for the army said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
Fathers of krautrock return
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group re-raced their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival will also include the 1974 Live, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already considerably better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists of the performance of three sedate gentlemen, who at first look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and mainly buttons in front of them.
Dieter Moebius, 63, in a snow-white shirt, sits in the middle.
To his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
The 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is leaning intently at the synthesizers, is on the right from the view of the viewers.
Each contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, inadvertently, they will be the traditional composition.
The gentlemen of the musicians don't seem to mind.
Among the lovers of the krautrock, the Turathi band's revival caused a considerable stir.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, it is certainly not established enough for someone to be so painfully missed by this band for twenty-three years.
But why could a German not even celebrate his still-living seventies legends?
And especially when he values the musical style, mistakenly called the krautrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the A Echo Award for life's work to the survivors of the members of the Cologne group, the hall was filled with inquisitive views from German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! at their speech, the astonishment of the viewers no longer knew the bounds.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we unnecessarily overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at the time it was far from the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name of Cluster.
At first they played in the cellar of the Berlin theatre Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a gramophone-led church-run gramophone.
Rother briefly helped out with the band Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the band's Cluster to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in the commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed toil like a nanny.
It was more a life in such a Spitzwegov artistic being.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the garbage can.
Many of this has been preserved by the Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following "De Lux."
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting the brides was not just self-recognized.
The now-release CD "Live 1974" is said to have been edited in front of a record-breaking small, barely 50-strong backdrop at a concert in Griesse.
Roth had then expressed a wish for the members of Harmony to get excited and practiced occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebio, this was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "Browing Heart."
The band Cluster came back to life in the 1980s and has been more successful ever since, more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record company, Grönland, took the goal of cherishing the krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered at the time to be a solo work by Roedeli.
The Healing Resurrection of Harmonie will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance of the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be the Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" handbook.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This outlined the overall breadth of the Krautrock's influence on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence accompanied by the most ardent sounds float in the hall: "A unique real music, she owns the future."
There are paintings that feature a producer with Harmony in a peasant's seat.
The projection of other black-and-white photographs also contribute to the creation of the legend, with a set of instruments of wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are once again preoccupied with improvisation.
No longer by gluing the microphones to the organ and drums to extract the previously unheard-of samlés notes from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into a technique of immersed metallic.
This is not changed by the congregation of the House of World Cultures.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she is whispered under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place, emfatically sings "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
We would find the roots in the music universities (Can), technology (Kraftwerk) or flee to art and social conventions (Cluster) in the blues.
He who excites "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but even now, Harmonia will not be taken out of her peace.
Even the most obvious is thought through on the scene.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question either takes one's nerve or allows one to experience the ephemeral moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, there were two films about the war in the Balkans.
But neither of them is convincing.
The draft films either place too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too moving.
He's not prevented from doing The Hunting Party by an actor like Richard Gere.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere will find himself.
Recently, we've lost sight of this most beautiful man in the eighties, not only because he's starred in many pleasing, unseasonable roles in cool women's movies, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on Buddhism, you'll be taken away from your appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become prey (Why must the names of the films be so long and confused these days?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is essentially who Gere might have become if fate and the film business were not so merciful: a man who, while long past his best years, but still retains a certain remarkable charm to the ruins like the convoluted monument.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which is also entering cinemas this week, is just a sequel to the endless series of failed films about the Balkans war.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that the Serbs are not here presented as the cause of all evil, this TV shallow film is turning into a shooting and action too early.
The film will leave something similar to the series, Kobru 11, with no highway, but with the war.
The Hunting Party's film shows you're downright graphic to see why a really good movie has not yet been made about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who embarks on the "fox," the Serbian head of war, might be the new "Accabi" at a different time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (the two of them, Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: the little groups go to the forest to do something the army is incapable of doing, but their journey becomes a madman.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the start.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party film can be finally written off after reporters in the film's last five quick-fast minutes of the film will do what NATO, the CIA, and all the hunters of the world's criminals have failed in the last five years: to catch criminals and leave him to the righteous revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of film-making that it would be worth going to the International Court of the Hague.
Yet this film has a deeply human message.
He condemns that Karadzic and Mladić are still at large, and suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen (they are exceptionally united here) that they do not pursue persecution quite intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, the famous Brecht poem invites us to us.
It's about the Asian demon's wooden mask on the writer's desk: "Consider compassionately at the swollen veins on my forehead, he says: how ardent it is to be."
In films like The Hunting Party, there are exactly the kind of swollen heads that suggest how ardent it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
It was recently written in this newspaper that all Hollywood's films about Iraq were the great failures.
There is only one thing to add: No good film about South Africa has ever been made before.
It's almost always true: When a star wanders around in a crisis area or walks around a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Boundary of Guzby with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film - Schindler's List.
Many of the film must probably ripen - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "Hoonshine Hunter," "Apocalypse" or "The Lead's Vest" - were in no way hailed as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens right away, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then do not have the ability to do without a flawless narration of good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great dictator" had become so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how horribly the Nazi regime had actually ruled.
Maybe you mustn't want to be good to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcastically awardly aloof artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked for a parallel between his historical novel, "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he said: "The ever-both-like thing is that some things never change.
Greater cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beuste for Canceling the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from hosting the Hamburg Summer Olympics has come up against fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight to organize the games by the water.
But Von Beusts is urging realism in estimating the chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the decision "unfortunately unfortunate" in terms of business.
No other project has recently woken up as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, this sporting political enthusiasm could not be sustained to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday at his earlier testimony, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"No to Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association to decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Association would decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means to us that we have no realistic chance of a timetable for the 2028 in the 2028."
Yet this dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's remarks regrettable.
He gives the impression that Hamburg will not want to compete for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too early to destroy our chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage," said the president of HSB, Günter Ploss, on Wednesday.
The renunciation would be inconsistent with the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he made at the general meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust here did not announce the nomination of Hamburg for the 2015 University as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association of Hamburg has only nominated for the candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Senate's Hamburg parliament has criticised the fact that it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook region was hindered by the Senate for years because it bet on the organisation of the Olympics and excluded the construction of the flats," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region was still planning the Olympics, with the entire area being used for home-or-fitting purposes later, the CDU unanimously betting on the "Olympic factor."
The run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, was wrecked on Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
He who combines the terms of Sweden and the wooden boxes is not thinking about Andy Warhol, but on Ikea.
Or is it?
The wooden crates produced in Sweden are currently casting dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of him on the list of the ninety-four "Brill Boxes" of the likes of Stockholm are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the authenticity of the 1968 Warhols's "Brillo Boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Modern Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with the result that brought disillusionment; the six "Brillo Boxes" which were given to the 1995 Museum by the Moderna Museet Museum by its former director, Pontus Hultén, are copies - as are the likes of Stockholm's other "Brillo Boxes" type of Stockholm, which are in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden crates that were based on the reddish-drome-white Brillo paper boxes of the paper box.
The exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 performed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo carton-bullshit. These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but of their designs, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo crates in Sweden, but these are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses at the time now speak of the fifteen crates that rightly entered the art and auction history as the authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" with the designation Typ Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made and displayed in Sweden about a hundred boxes, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultene boxes were only made in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg in 1990.
By then, Warhol was three years dead.
Lars Byström, the head conservator of Moderna Museet, explored, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also explored three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and, after their plywood boards were painted in the base and rerealised, the brush was coiled with oil white.
On the contrary, it emerged from the 1990 copy structure that the colour was applied to the coating without a previous basic coat of paint directly on the plylich board - in addition to being an acrylic and not an oil colour.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo boxing list," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board's organization in New York will not come to other conclusions, the Moderna Museet will have to classify six raften from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies"."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into these "fright-seeki allegations" that had been raised in the matter of boxes of soapy powder.
But the organization is still in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
Rebelilial soldiers surrendered in the Philippines, fortifying themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebels commander Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for tampering and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government had previously attacked the hotel with the use of tear gas.
Hours before, about two dozen soldiers had been fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood trial for a foiled coup attempt in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to flee with his 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to be watching him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's loyal forces have cordoned off the area around the hotel's selected.
The president called an urgent session of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for major demonstrations to take place against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been blamed for corruption.
The Manila financial area had already become the main site of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo in 2003.
As the rebels were refused to join the army, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines at least seven times.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
The company is now said to own 20.05% of the share capital.
There had been speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is thus seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5 % to 15.1%, there were arguments about entry on Wednesday.
The financial market says this financial institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet at Drillisch, a mobile telecoms provider of mobile telecommunications networks, was already worth a share.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put another 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million in sales.
Of this, the 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing co-ops on DSL and mobile network products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
In order to take over Freenet's competitor, the companies jointly established a joint venture between SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies would be comfortable with a share of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and would not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49% of the business.
The companies are considered to have kept all options open so far, in particular the possibility to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
The United Internet and Freenet's talks on the strategic partnership were terminated in mid-November.
This already months-long and hard-to-preparse game of Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile network contract customers and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections at the end of the third quarter.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It is now said to have been agreed that Drillisch would get around another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
