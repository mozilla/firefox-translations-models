An unusually open and unique painting by Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature documentary
This unique film feat from Olga Špátová's workshop will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In the middle of September last year I got a call from Ivanka and Karel Gott, and they asked me if, after ten years, I would again make a documentary about his life with Karl. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who has endured more than half a century in the glory of Czech culture through his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable hardships, was and is a great honour for me. I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, which brings joy to three generations of listeners with his arts, as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
The first shooting day, thanks to a quick agreement and an agreement, took place already 22. October of last year and the last footage of Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who is given away to his supporters, as a painter but also a loving husband and father of his children. A man who, with his songs, gives out the joy of several generations with his songs not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has entered the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a parade of the undisputed glory of Karel Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film The Phenomenon Gott with this present one. Everyone is different. At a minimum, by filming them in another life stage of Karel Gott, and this will be very reflected in his personal, even intimate confession he provided to us, which has confirmed to us all of us in the way the legend we have the opportunity to work and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, in meetings with his fans in the Czech Republic and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. The film will thus be completely authentic and unique thanks to the sincere openness of Karel Gott.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with his narrow team so that we often got carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let it into our privacy, which made me talk about topics of relatively confidential. She and her husband, the cameraman Jan Malír, actually became a part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my jubilee of my life. But because I had a lovely summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. Well, and since there was a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was to be released in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary is a thank you to my supporters and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession," says Karel Gott himself to the film.
Insects are up to 60 times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Bugs, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are more reports that the insect kingdom is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and the situation is even more serious than humanity has ever realized.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As the report says at the outset, the insects are now "ten to 60 times less" in the forest. This is a decline in the whole population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research involved not only insects but all the members. The extinction of insects is then dwindled by the population of other fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards.
The authors of the research put their conclusions directly in the context of climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius in the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. The study thus shows, according to the author's team, that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously believed.
The report was published Monday in a major article in the Washington Post, which presents the new findings in the headline as hyperallegant. "This is one of the most disturbing articles I have ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, who is quoted as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also applies to Europe. "For us, the decline is also of the order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, in addition to climate change, it is necessary to take into account the transformations of the landscape, which play an essential role in Europe. "We only run significantly longer than on Puerto Rico," Čížek adds by explaining why scientists could have measured such a rapid decline in the forest compared to the 1970s.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia reject the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? Three times NO
The undated picture depicts Adolf Hitler's visit to the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies joined in.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia were to reject the Munich Agreement and then face a German attack, what would take the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or artillery? It might not be one of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the most losses - because of the blisters.
Police union president Stepanek resigned, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Union, Milan Štěpánek, decided to leave office. It was presented on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. The union has been led by Stepanek since 2005. He will be president of the union for two more months. He will remain with the police and after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that I have handed over to the Bureau this week my written resignation, after which I will continue to serve full for two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have chosen to be a free man who does not want to be bound to the union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said, explaining the reasons for the departure.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. The Association participated, among other things, in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. He also got into a dispute with the then Interior Minister Radek John in 2011, for example, and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed to leave John.
Museum in Semily returns to the velvet Revolution with the exhibition
Imitation of a normalization room with a television, in which footage of the brutal police raided the police against the students on 17 November 1989 in Prague. This, too, is at the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the exhibition's curator, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere with the first demonstration in Semily on 22 November, and then other people gradually packed up every day," he said. Among the most active were a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one in the city and immediate vicar to sign Charter 77, and Mr and Mrs. Grandfather, who were expanding the Several Sentences petition. Quite quickly, according to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was created at the time. "One specific thing is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
The events in the city at the time should be drawn by some 50 photographs, the pictures were taken by Karel Bárta 30 years ago. A video of the general strike on 27 November 1989 preserved by František Tomíček, who will be played in a loop throughout the exhibition. He spoke at the demonstration at the time and also sang Ivan the Voice. The Semil archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition. "On them it was: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some of the changes in the city were very quick at the time, for example, in December, people decided in a all-South vote that the square would be Riegrovo and the previous name Gottwald's had been revoked.
The exhibition also depicts events before the events of the November events. "In the first part, we present to the old-timers and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze record from the then museum of the labouring movement at the time," said Chvátal. One room is just meant to make you feel the sense of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It is aimed at the first free elections. "We've injected one of the room with campaign posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters With Us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for His Village," the curator added.
Let the fans be positive, Hasek wishes. Sparta awaits a hit in Pilsen
"We'll play to the limit, we'll do everything we can to succeed. In order to manage the match in the game and the result," Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview on club television.
In the week, the goal was scored by a cup duel in Jihlava (2-1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She was relieved, but the game is still in trouble.
Even though the season is slowly spilling over into the second, Soccer Sparta is still looking for a face, which was being discussed by coach Václav Jílek at the outset of his engagement.
'But it's still Sparta, which has very high quality players. We are going to have a difficult match," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in the Štruncovy sady for the last time, in mid-May it was a clear-cut affair in the superstructure. The visitors left after a mindless performance with a 0-4 thrashing, the biggest in the history of the Czech league in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the gap between the clubs in the table was eight-point at the time before the match, Sparta now loses nine points after ten games played in the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst entries to the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club in a completely different place than they are at the moment," Hashk feels. "But we'd like them to continue to support us, to stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if he will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match penalty for being eliminated in Pilsen but appealed against him on Friday.
In the numerous sickbay remain Costa, Dockal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the cadre to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home side, who, including Wednesday's Cup in Hlučín, won the last five matches, should only miss the midfielder Čermák. And as captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, the Spartans' outfielder.
Download for free Metro 2033 Redux and Everything on PC, time until Thursday
The link to both games is on the Epic Store here. You can include games in your library and directly via the web, but you need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play. Time is until 3. October.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original game from 2010, adding both graphic and game changes from the Last Light sequel.
The story, based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's book of the same name, takes place in 2033 in Russia after the nuclear war. The Earth's surface as we know it no longer exists. Humanity had to take refuge under the ground, in our case to the vast complexes of the Moscow Metro.
"Take the post-apocalyptic world and the oppressive atmosphere from unfamiliar environments, take it away from the vastness of the world and add a lot of spectacular scripts and action passages and trada: Metro 2033 is in the world," we wrote on Bonusweb in a contemporary review.
Everything, on the other hand, is a relaxing game-nothing in a procedural-generated world that bears the message of the English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. A player can become anything from animals to trees to the planet.

"The terrifying result of the study." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable incredulity for Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of the Austrian population fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on the construction of mosques. For more monitoring of the centres of Islam, 80 percent are asked.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, and argue that they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country because of the presence of Muslims.
"The study's result is terrifying," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "This tendency to ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. The religious freedoms admitted to the Muslims are in danger of being narrowed."
For believers, the critical stance is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but among cultures. The help to blunt polarization could, according to the sociologist, dialogue and education.
The most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by the extreme right, with people without a university degree, or seniors over the age of 75, according to the study. The most welcoming, on the other hand, are the Greens' voters, the people under the age of 30 and the college students.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, there are approximately 700,000 Muslims in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: Czechs were kicked out of a hotel in Mallorca. The guarantees were not enough
The petition for insolvency in the week was also filed by the Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group. The future of the Czech branch is being discussed at the moment, a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic Jan Papež, there are three variants of possible solutions in play - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or the team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which of them it will be, but it is not possible to predict, it will be up to the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to the two prematurely terminated tours, the TA also addresses cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own, although the company tries to provide guarantees to the hoteliers. TA promised to reimburse its clients for the payments, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient collateral for this.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to the Czech News Agency one of the cases in which the hotel there fired all the tourists' offices. "The hector couldn't determine who belonged to the German and who under Czech society. He therefore fired everyone from the hotel even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up by almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, fell by about seven million to CZK 15.3 million. However, from previous years, the company's outstanding loss remained in nearly CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions - alongside CK Neckermann, it is the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump considers revoking US registration of Chinese stock
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking Chinese firms' permission to trade on stock markets in the United States. Reuters was told by an informed source today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately went down after the news, pulling the entire market with them.
The withdrawal of shares would be part of a wider effort to limit US investment in China, the source added. He confirmed a Bloomberg report that had recently caused a shock to the financial markets. Shares in Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, the US Nasdaq and NYSE trades shares of 156 Chinese firms. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg pointed out that an exact mechanism had not yet been developed to secure the withdrawal of Chinese firms' shares from the US exchanges. The possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who gave the green light to discuss the matter.
China and the US have been fighting a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has had negative effects on the world economy and is raising concerns about the recession of the global economy. Washington is using customs fees to get Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's surplus in US trade.
According to CNBC, trade negotiations between the US and China should be renewed on the 10th. October. His goal is to end a trade war.
Police accuse CzechTourism manager Aleš Pangrác over promotion contracts
Police have charged the former manager of the state-run CzechTourism agency, Aleš Pangrá, over contracts to promote them. Pangrác confirmed to the server SeznamMed with the news that he took the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that officers were examining contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. Police say some of the money was being returned to Pangrác, the site reports. In the case, the criminologists were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Kládra Dostálová (for YES), to whose ministry, CzechTourism. The investigation in the case continues, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Organized Crime Center secured evidence in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, the headquarters of CzechTourism, the autodromu in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The service computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court's search warrant at Dostálová, which was previously quoted by ČT, said that the minister had made decisions in 2016, when she was deputy, the expenses of CzechTourism in favour of the chosen persons, through the mediated and outside the standard official procedure. At the time, Dostál said she felt absolutely innocent, she had not made a mistake, could document everything and cooperate fully with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual's misconduct. The media has previously reported that it is the former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrá, who was dismissed for the results of the audit. This showed that the CzechTourism agency had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, I've been accused. But I don't want to comment further," Pangrác told the North List of News.

Religious school in Nigeria freed hundreds of enslaved children
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, reported that there were over three hundred children from the age of five above. Some were chained to each other, others were chained to the iron circles in the wall.
The head of the police in Khazov, Ali Janga, told the BBC that the raid at the school was conducted on the basis of a tip-off. He described the school as a house of horrors. The starving people there were being forcibly held, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was a razor wire above the wall. He says it's a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakub Sabo, the teacher there.
The children told the police that they were taken to the school by parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most of them were brought here by parents from the Nigerian states in the north," a Sabo spokesman said of the victims' identity. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The imam Ahmad bin Hanbal school was posing as a religious school focused on studying the Koran.
The liberation was taken to the stadium, where they are provided with assistance and food. Some have met with relatives.
The French chef is suing Michelin over the removal of the star. I suffer from depression, he claims
The renowned French chef, Marc Veyrat, lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. He intends to sue the publisher of the red guide in order to receive the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competencies of the Michelin-starred inspectors, who he believes have mistook the saffron for cheddar. The first court hearings are due to take place in November.
The chef of La Maison de Bois, the famous restaurant in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy, lost one of his three Michelin stars in January of this year. He will sue the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Guide, as he said the commissioners' conclusion was not properly justified. The removal of the asterisk, according to him, also occurred without any notice. "I have been in depression for six months. How dare you mess with the health of the cooks?" Veyrat told the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have given the chef only vague reasons, such as putting the chef in the soufflé cheddar, which the inspection did not like. 'I put the saffron in it, and the gentlemen thought it was a cheddar because it was yellow. I have worked with love with the savoy ingredients from the beginning," Veyrat said. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin-starred commissioners: "You are fraudsters who just instigate disputes for commercial reasons." The outraged Veyrat doesn't understand "how could they afford to say we put in our soufflé cheddar." "They insulted our region as well, my staff made mad. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said.
The distinguished chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin-starred commissioners, and therefore calls for the removal of his restaurant from a red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do so. "If the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, the international director of Michelin.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies to the fact that he does not yet have any meaningful accusation and the lawyer is yet to help him formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat is cogranous with us. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two three-star restaurants.
A technically perfect confusion with a weak scenario. Glory with Will Smith's criticism did not rally
The Dytrack sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will face his younger version in the film. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be watched by 100. October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute top of his business. It kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. One day, however, he decides to hang up his career. This, of course, does not sit well with his employers, who will send another assassin to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, to be more precise, his younger clone made of DNA. Can one determined man win the fight over himself? This time literally.
A sure guarantee of quality was to be three-time Oscar-winning Oscar's Ang Lee. It may be his first sci-fi, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated in the aforementioned Tigger and the Dragon or the Western Ride with the Devil. The screenplay was attended by six screenwriters. The most famous is surely David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. But according to the first feedback, even all this was not enough for a good movie.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do big things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have the character to highlight it," thinks Fionnuna Hannigan of the Screen Daily.
"This unsatisfactory film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his opinion.
"The collider is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an impossibly unhinged action film," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge says.
"A confusing product with a bizarre idea," the film summarized in her review by Ella Kemp of the IndieWire website.
"It's hard to be interested in the fact that one man is a double of the other when neither behaves like a person," wrote Nicholas Barber from The Wrap.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
The banks provide child accounts for free. But the offer needs to be considered because some other services to accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is free, is straightforward. The financial houses are counting on the forgiven fees to be refunded one day. The small migration of Czechs among the banks is probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Small accounts," she says, are pretty much at all that adult accounts do. The child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, track the movements in the account, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. The banks will set up the account, but it is up to the parents to teach the children how to use them and also check their payment.
"After a flexible, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services and the like. Above all, however, it can monitor what is happening in the account, either by looking over the internet or by using an information text message. Attention, they don't have to be free anymore," Kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, he or she should consider his or her abilities and options."
Strict but fair, we enjoy the clock! That's how the Benes Gymnasiums see their favorite teacher writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, a novelist and a fistwoman of literary life in a small town.
Over the texts of Pavel Hoza, Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, shimmering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and the people who have been after them for centuries. Mourning, cursing, blessing. This Reynek's contemporary continuator teaches at the Gymnasium in Benešov's Czech, literature and history, runs the word for a word in the word for his word at the local Café, and annually holds the Benešov Literary Festival.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! Ended up in the Institute
It was about nerve. The allegedly troubled son, Ondřej (9) was harshly punished by his father every now and then. "He came home from school and lied to his snack. Lukas looked at me and said he would kneel as a punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukas made little Ondra kneeling in the corner for several hours! Outside of the cameras, he said, he had to suffer like this on a wooden pad for a foot massage! "Ondrej came to me after the shoot and he told me - auntie, I'm just making trouble and notes so I'm not here because I want to go to the institute," Lucie said, describing the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the set door. And the wishes finally came true for the boy...
His condition was so serious that the family was taken from it after filming and placed for a month at the Centre for Education Care in České Budějovice. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) briefly, but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I got home, Aneta immediately posted to Facebook, we wrote to each other for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I hardly responded to that. But then she texted me that the little one was in the institute, that he was returned to them afterwards, now he's in the diagnosis. They are both out of work," says Lucia's mother from Pilsen.
Lightning, of course, addressed the other side, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call back later," Aneta said, and hung up the phone.
Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against a double-header penalty
Soccer Sparta has appealed against a two-game penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, who was received by the player from the disciplinary committee for dismissal in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0-3).
The Letenský klub informed about this on its Twitter feed and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his penalty in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now seeking to have the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker in the 11th-round draw in the first leg of Sunday's first-leg in Pilsen.
The situation from last October could be repeated. At the time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who was given a one-game suspension from the Disciplinary Board on Thursday for his suspension against Liberec.
The appeals committee failed to hear the case, so it dropped the effectiveness of the penalty and Falta was able to start on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The committee finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the next week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
The disciplinarian Tetteh stopped his activities for a foul on the Glory's David Hovorka, for whom he received a flat red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spit of the Ghana player on the captain of the opponent's opponent, Tomáš Soucek, has not been proven.
The Germans chose Keller to lead the Football Association
The new chairman of the German Football Association, as expected, was the Bundesliga's current head of the Bundesliga side, Fritz Keller. The 25-year-old winemaker, gastronomist and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, with no opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over the unacknowledged income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger, and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go to trial for possible bribing for hosting the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said one of the main goals would be to restore the union's confidence and take it out of the crisis. "It won't be one Man Show, many people will be responsible. The union is better than his reputation," said Keller, who presented all his assignments under the slogan: Together, we will be able to do it.
After being elected to head the union, Keller left the post in Freiburg.
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. No one was injured in it, however, the spokesperson of the mining company Ivo Čelechovský told the Czech Press Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 at the loser at a depth of about 1,200 meters. "No employees were hurt, no one was injured. The on-site immediately attended the Mane rescuers, who disposed of the fire by direct intervention and carried out examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special committee.
The former Ostrava-Karviná district is already mined with coal only in the Karviná part, in the mines of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-South. In Dole Lazy, mining should finish later this year, with a gradual downturn awaiting the other mines. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, with last year's production of 4.62 million tonnes. There are 9,000 people working in the mines.
Berlin responds to public pressure and addresses the housing crisis. From a private company, they buy 6000 flats
Berlin buys from Luxembourg-based company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros ($23.8 billion) of 6,000 former social housing that the city sold 15 years ago. It responds to public pressure that is rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left Party (Die Linke), it is the largest such buyout in the history of the capital, Germany. The opposition is critical of the move.
"The intention is to keep the rents stable in Berlin and give the tenants certainty," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new flats and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal firm Gewobag will take over thousands of flats located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensive. He told Bloomberg Rothäusler that he estimated that the housing units had overpaid by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the Liberals (FDP) of the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation by their actions. The FDP tweeted on Friday. The move was described as "waste by money" the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Already in mid-July, Gewobag won back to 670 flats in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The award was not released by the council at the time. The dispute over the flats on the former exhibition class from the time of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the plight of tenants in major German cities, the paper wrote.
Meanwhile, the German metropolis used to be renowned for low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained attractiveness. According to AFP, the prices of rents have doubled over the past decade, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing the Brno-based company over the name Lokia. People don't mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia lodged objections to the Lokia brand application to the Industrial Property Office. According to the CCV, however, the product mix-up is unlikely.
Brno-based software firm CCV is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns don't like the fact that the Brno-based warehouse management company's program is called Lokia WMS, the daily E15 wrote. Nokia therefore filed objections to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. The CCV reckons that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that two dozen customers have been using the program, and has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone attempts to register a stamp that we believe may lead to a mix-up or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said spokesman for Nokia Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they did not think of the brand famous for the brand famous in the past with mobile phones when creating a stock program. The designation Lokia, according to CCV, is based on the Latin name for one type of weighing agent, whose rapid movement is supposed to be an analogy of warehouse movement.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of substitution is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies equip their warehouse operations with, and we really don't go to the production of mobile phones. And we don't want a comparison to a brandy that may be running a train in his field," responded CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák in E15.
The CCV applied for the brand's protection in August before the programme was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "The protection was requested for products and services in Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to the class 9, related business business management services in the warehouse are in Class 35 and the development of computer software into class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier mark Nokia is valid in all classes of goods and services, thus applying to the widest possible range of goods and services and, therefore, of course, overlap in classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the allegation of the allegation in relation to conformity in these product and service classes. Realistically, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups," Ondrášek said.
The brand dispute can take months, according to E15, and it may complicate the company's activities.
From Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, perhaps reality
The Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to powered the aircraft at twice the speed at the Concordes. "When the Sabre engine is put into operation, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And the distance between London and New York, for example, could be covered by the plane in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is five times in excess, are complicated because of the engine overheating. But this problem should be dealt with by the Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) by using the super cold helium to prevent the rise in temperatures.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it is a hybrid rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a jet of exhaust generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "The sorts of sorts of have not undergone such a big development in the last 70 years, while the aircraft's have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very lightweight and efficient propulsion system and basically create a spacecraft," he said.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to start around the middle of next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
Kovosvit is selling the administration building and other halls. Expects a worse time
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million, with a consolidated turnover of CZK 1.3 billion. Last year's main problems include the Chef's shortage of workers and subcontractors' shifts. Demand for machine tools has fallen this year, by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also linked to the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," the Director-General said. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and land, which it is either not using or minimally. This also applies to the administration building, where it uses two of the five floors, and not yet quite. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan, it is to downsize Kovosvit to streamline its activities. The sale of assets is not part of a current solution, whether it is cash flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," the CEO said.
About half of Kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, to a lesser extent to Asia last year. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting in India, where Kovosvit won a contract for five-axis machining machines worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis CZK 30 million worth of machines to China. "An next contract is agreed in the same volume that we would like to fulfill before the end of the year," said Kuchař. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions over sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a subcontractor for Airbus. She supplied it with another machine in May this year, with one more to deliver at the end of the year or early 2020.
The main corporate investment this year was the transfer of heating from a steam to a hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for cast bricure for the foundry, machinists, latheers and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and arms manufacturer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company had as many as three thousand employees in its time.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen for itself! Says Andor Shandor
There is still ambiguity around the funeral of the brigadier general Milan Jakubů. The media speculated in the week that the army's final farewell to the deputy director of Military intelligence had planned, despite the family's wishes, as the soldiers could. There were also discrepancies about the date of the funeral. Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the arranged Friday's funeral date has been valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. As do military honours. We will just still deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Lightning on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place really on Friday and will not be missed with all military honours, including the flyover of the fighters.
Around the final farewell to the popular general, however, the atmosphere is tense. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by the decision of the organizers by the people who have worked with the general in the past!
These include the former head of military intelligence, Andor Shandor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Shandor remembers the former colleague as a hard-working, intelligent, and "good guy."
In addition, he has met regularly with him in recent years at the anniversary celebrations of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," said Blesk Shandor. But he can't.
"I know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates are usurping for themselves. I think that privatising a funeral in this way is not right," the security expert said. Nor does he have a supposedly considered closure of the ceremony for the public due to the secrecy of the army's top brass.
"The leadership of the army is not undercover, and the military intelligence leaders are not, either, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the information from the media is true and the family has actually been seduced by the army, it is, of course, a matter for the family. Personally, I would never allow the army to overwhelm the family and its wishes," concluded Shandor.
Milan Jakubů died in a car accident near Špindlerův Mlýn on Saturday. The front-run collision between Milan's Rapid and the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer on the bend was supposed to enter the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the encounter. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police interviewed the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Comment by Jan Šindelář: Running Trajectes as a Company
The Heavenly Election, though apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the railroads a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday night, it doesn't change, as one of the members resigned. The makeshift is taking hold.
The selection process itself was a farce from the outset because the requirements for candidates were significantly mitigated, especially in the area of practice. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was to operate in the past have been reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.
Heavenly submitted arguably the weakest professional biography of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company he rubbed off experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transportation businesses. The participation of interesting private sector managers was perhaps the brightest point (and best hope) of the process. By now, those concerned know that they played only the role of narcude scenes in the political game.
Perhaps Sky will surprise, show great talent, and eventually turn out to be the best runner in all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of the political tobacconist. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, it has to cope with competition in market liberalisation and a shortage of staff in operation. There are no drivers, shifters and mechanics. What are the motivations to keep working and respect for management when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in a chinaire?
The second important group is the creditors. How to unload the games at the top of the runways, we will see next spring when the runters defend the rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. Sadly, someone else goes to the Moody's agency for Czech Railways to defend the rating every year. The agency's frequent changes in runway management and political influence on the company have not escaped, it has criticized them as early as this summer.
The ANO movement spearles, among other things, the slogan that the state needs to be run as a business. For starters, it would be enough if he ran one large state-owned company as a company rather than as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be a good idea if the best run them. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive the shenanigans with the selection process.
The pair wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the sack found the children
The case took place at the end of July in the village around Valašské Klobouk. The 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. Her partner, ten years older, but didn't like the fact that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated his vocal delivery. He put the dog in a jute bag he bound. Then together the animal was taken to the river, where they had thrown it in the bag. The dog was demonstrably alive when the dog was thrown into the water," said Zlín police spokesperson Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, the children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called to the woman passing by and ran. The woman reported the incident to the emergency number of police 158.
"Thanks to the knowledge of the town's residents, the police found out who was probably the perpetrator of this incredible act. And they were right. The man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," the police spokesperson said.
Expert comments in the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a clearly harrowing manner as a result of as a suffocation, when the animal suffered in a matter of minutes before the death.
"The actions of the perpetrators no doubt point to clear their intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible manner, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in accessory to the fact. Both hitherto non-punitned charges could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková said.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen's last album posthumously released
The album Thank You for the Dance (Thanks for the Dance) will feature unpublished material and various musical collaborations that have been put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically cows to the approaching death. He died a month after the album was released at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials he was left with. He has invited a number of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or the singer Beck.
"When we invented music for the father's words, we used his own characteristic musical techniques. So he's always with us," Adam Cohen said of the album. "What impresses me most about him is the reactions of those who have heard it before. One by one, they say that Leonard is still alive," he added.
The album's first swallow is the short song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost home," Cohen sings in her characteristic honeyed voice. He sang of death, suspecting he would not live to see the release of the new material. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker a month before he died. "I am prepared to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable,' he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published his father's poetry collection called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the name Flame on 31 December by Argo.
First Miss Christ came at last into herself: She dropped a few pounds and immediately saw through
The first modern-day Miss from 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had a problem with overweight for years, causing her not only physical problems, but especially the mental ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it looks like she took the reproaches to heart and went into battle with the excess pounds. Even if it's a long shot.
It used to be a first-class beauty who conquered Paris. But it's been thirty years since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty pageant. Not just for the fame, but also for how skinny she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to the strict modeling rules that ordered her to be as skiffed and often not eaten as possible. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she was in the mood for.
But she went from hunger strikiness to overeating, which immediately signed up for her figure. In addition, Kila tried to disguise various loose clothes, which added to the hip-treated shapes on the size.
Now it looks like Ivana really went into herself. She lost weight visibly, began to dress tastefully and suitably to her fuller figure.
She surprised everyone at the christening of the book by Miloš Zapletal (75) that she had seen through again and already had back the features of the glamorous brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first Miss winner after the revolution, but also the controversy her victory caused.
Christová will forever be the first beauty winner, but also the very first one, which the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistleered as a slander when she put on a crown.
"Parodie to justice." Scientist warns of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Sik and other scientists participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. It concluded that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer in local residents.
Scientists mentioned mainly the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which is about 80 kilometres from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallinky plants are based. People living around it, they say, suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for the coup, international criticism notwithstanding
It seemed to Sik that the government, notwithstanding the clear findings of the study, was not taking any action on the matter. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently prosecuted him for leaking classified information.
"The study has clearly shown the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of the studies directly related to public health may be kept undercame. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"The Turkish authorities, instead of persecuting the alarm-beating people through the courts, should investigate this important problem for public health," said Andrew Gardner of the AI branch of Turkey.
Organisations engaged in environmental protection and human rights have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing environmental protection regulations in certain regions, despite the rapid development of industry.
After the thwarted 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime began a massive wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of employees of the Cumhuriyet daily. The authorities also suspended the service or fired the total 150,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organizations have accused the government of using the attempted coup to persecute its opponents. But the authorities argue that these are the measures needed to ensure national security.
The fastest man on the planet missed tests. I'm not taking anything, he's fighting back
The traditionally highly watched contest for the fastest man on the planet will be a hurry at the World Championships to defend the silver champion Christian Coleman. The 23-year-old American is the world's world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. His start at the height of the season was, however, at risk due to a case with missed doping tests.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case without being charged on formal grounds for formal reasons in early September. Coleman did not take three doping tests last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense was dated back to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) by April 1, 2018, at the start of the second quarter, but the test itself did not skip up to 6. June. And because the third omission took place on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit the offense in the form of three untested inspections within 12 months.
Coleman argued that he had only forgotten to update the data in the athlete's residence application. "I don't take drugs or take anything legal. Many athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about," he said before the start of MS.
His only defeat of his six starts to the 100 this year was when he entered the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was outnumbered by compatriot Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run a two-hundred at the World Championships.
The paper's second fastest competitor, with a performance of 9.86, 22-year-old Nigerian player Divine Oduduru, who has only done well at U.S. college competitions.
Defending the title will be the now 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who scored a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb but only in 10.29 because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
The favourite circuit also includes South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic gold medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican with a time time of 9.96 is the 2011 world champion Yohan Blake.
The men's 100 will begin on Friday with a pre-season and heats. The semi-finals and finals are on Saturday. The medals will be run at 21:15 GMT.
Fall of plane at Žinkov in Pilsen: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were travelling on the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The aircraft at 8:30 p.m. applied for permission to land at Chaloupky Airport near Klatovy," police spokesperson Dana Ladman said. This was also the last recording, at that time it was supposed to be located at Vojovice near Žinkov, according to the GPS coordinates.
It no longer reached the Klatovy airport. The lost aircraft, which had sent out a distress signal, was immediately searched. "A military helicopter was involved in addition to the police," police spokesperson Martina Korandová said. But there was no happy end to the search operation.
In the woods near Petrovic, near Měčín, about six kilometres from where the plane was last rounded, the wreckage of the helicopter's crew noticed the wreckage before 9 a.m. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korand confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of the trees, with pieces falling to the ground nearby. "We will be investigating the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and the staff of the Institute for Professional Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Civilization in the lent-loop
Recently, I was reminded of a beautiful "catchwatch" from one of the great stories of Simek and Grossmann, set out in part in the cemetery, which reads like this: "I pointed out to her that she is crying well, but on a stranger's grave!" It occurred to me that very similarly now behaved by many of the world's politicians involved in the senseless fight against climate change.
They act like people reign on planet Earth. In fact, we're just a speck on its surface, which she can blow out with her ginger-food forces like a fierce breeze of wind with a candle flame. Perhaps few of them look at the famous British and American science documents about the destruction skills of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to be properly "dumped" and our advanced civilization will poop.
And that it will happen in the near future is highly likely. Many of the big volcanoes, according to the leaders' volcanologists, have "charged and armed" (for example, Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen, had happened as soon as possible. Before the billions of dollars are wasted, a measure to reduce carbon dioxide production, for a needless one, because any of the harshly angry sopers, along with the dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release it into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than has been spared at the expense of the people of Europe.
Violently, therefore, to limit CO2 production makes no sense. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that at its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants are more biological matter and are also more drought-resistant. For humanity, any warming is considerably more favorable than the rapid return of the Ice Age, for example.
If we make aware of the still under-explored impact of the solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try to keep the Earth as clear as possible and make it easier for other changes to which we cannot measure with force, let us try to adjust to the smallest cost!
Repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The Administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) has pushed the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabi. The original deadline for the opening of the envelopes was on 20 September, said the spokesman of the national park, Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for submitting the bids is to reduce the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with the prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, it is a price that we expect to be offered. If someone makes a bid that will be acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the museum's repair is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor of the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Authority, the European subsidies for the CZK 123 million for the project are not at risk.
The administration of KRNAP is failing to choose the construction company for the museum's repairs. The second contest was announced this summer because in the previous tender all the company's bids far exceeded the then projected price of 65 million. The bids exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is housed in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exhibition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The now-creaked building should be created by the end of 2021 after the KRNAP visitor centre converting the exhibitions.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people perched in the mountains and build on the successful Stone and Life Exhibition, should serve as a representative gateway for visitors as a representative gateway to the Giant Mountains. The visitor centre should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains as understand as possible in the most understandable form and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of the traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans include building a new entrance to the building, creating a research room or a café.
Toyota of hydrogen still believes, preparing second generation of Mirai
The Toyota Mirai was never supposed to be just a concept. Toyota was so serious about her that even though there was virtually no hydrogen-pumping infrastructure in the world, she put it on the menu. Not to the very standard, the customer had to go after this car in a really targeted way, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota's chief executive Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will be coming next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be price-efficient to hybrids within a decade. Of course, this is linked to the development of petrol networks. However, the future is as much aligned with hydrogen as much as electricity.
The conference often used to bring down the word hydrogen with the needs of ecological operation not for passenger cars, but on the contrary for large trucks, ships, trains, etc. Just the means of transport that need to be traveled for a long distance in one. The pure-accket-powered versions cannot offer this. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover, believes in hydrogen drive.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
When choosing red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - check out the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if green, then you are among the warm types. When choosing a new red lipstick, put it in the first row on the line just for the subtree-based. Only in the next one, look at the texture.
If you rank with women with a cold undertone, then you are suitable for you with purple, plum, cherry or mauve paints.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose such lipsticks as well. You can tell them by the fact that they gravitate to orange, coral, gold or brown glare.
It may be the case that some veins look green and others in blue. In this case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your colour preferences.
Purpose gossip? The Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
Most recently at the end of this month. The city's management blames this on the rumors that sprang up around the former zoo director, as well as the veterinarian Václav Poživil, for purposefully killing the exotic animals he cared for. For example, the female rhino Zamba, the elephant Kalu or the orangutan ňuňák.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated fulfilment value of CZK 3.5 million excluding VAT and for the Municipal Centre for Animals in the Children in the Urban Centre for Emergency with an expected fulfilment of CZK 2.8 million without VAT," said city spokesperson Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city was announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unsubstantiated suspicions. I consider it an outrageous defamation of such a quality expert," she noted.
Experts specialising in exotic animals are very few, she says. "It's certainly not pleasant. The zoo, meanwhile, provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same money. "But the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of funding," explained zoo spokesperson Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is among the respected experts. He participated, for example, in a unique operation in which the Ústí cheetahséka Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total prosthesis. He served as director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He made no comment on the anonymous slander. Yesterday he did not receive phone calls or respond to text messages.
As far as the commission for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians think that there is not necessarily concern for it of such expedient allegations, as in his case, but simply a little awareness. For example, the veterinarian in Ústí, Jiří Král, has never heard of her. "This is your first time I've heard it. No one approached us. Such a thing will, I think, spread quickly," he added.
Line D will be overseen by new to the metro architect, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has selected an architect to oversee the shape of the metropolitan metro. Anna Švarc will become it from October, her first task will be the look of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. According to her, the metro cannot be viewed only as a transport structure, the underground travel should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who co-authored the reconstruction of three London metro stations, won a tender launched by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to it, a further 14 applicants took part in the tender. "Part of the selection process was a letter of motivation and a resume. Apparently my previous practice from London decided, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the metro there in the team of three people," says the new architect of the metro. In her view, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the City Council could have also been decided. Prague.
He doesn't just see the subway as a traffic foscock. Stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the subway will change, how the space will be improved, I have to. But how it will be realistically will be, I will not know until in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to its ideas," Švarc says.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed at maintaining the context of all stations in the event of being reconstructed," the manual says.
Whether it is a similar tool in the way to improve public space on the Prague metro is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. "Whether the manual is an ideal or whether a personality can be roofed, I really don't know yet," Švarc concludes.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, with public commemoration on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. This is reported by French media, citing the Chirac family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at the commute at Paris's Invalides, where a coffin will be displayed with the Chirac's remains, the Elysee Palace announced.
Crowds have been pouring into the presidential residence since Thursday evening, according to AFP, to sign the condolence book. That will be possible until Sunday. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a national mourning.
Meanwhile, there are further reactions from the world and from France to the death of the former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, who was now described by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe as "Francouze in the truest sense of the word."
Chiraca was remembered by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love for their country and the sum of sport. The news of the former French president's death appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sportsmanship, the French press is being noted.
The tribal arts museum on the Quai Branly avenue in Paris, which was founded by Chirac, will not collect admission for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
Opening of the Pumpkin World delayed the maturing of pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farmhouse in Nové Ves u Leština na Havlíčkobrodsko opened Pumpkin World today for more than a month. Decorations stacked from thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by a mighty orange pyramid in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, as pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipkov family's fields have matured for longer. There are still a lot of them in the field now, Jaroslava Pipková told the Czech Press Agency today.
The Pipes have been cultivating many types of pumpkins, but they have not enjoyed the weather for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some species failed. "Orange pumpkins for Halloween are plentiful as usual, but some species have failed for connoisseurs," Pipková said. Nevertheless, it is possible to choose from several species on the farm, from the aforementioned large pumpkins suitable as well as to carve and pave the decorations through pumpers to boil hokaido or long "spaghette" to ornamental pumpkins of various colours and shapes.
Pumpkin cultivation is laborious. Farmers use the plants to hog with their fruits, cutting off the pumpkin with scissors from the stem. The Pumpkin World has been regularly opened to Pipka since 2010, with thousands of people attracted the previous year's. The decoration from the pumpkins is complemented by the attractions made of straw or the mazes from the logs. Visitors will also see animals bred on the farm. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, even pumpkin muffins or juice. Other options for the pumpkin treatment in the kitchen are called by the visitors themselves. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, we get inspired, too," Pipková said. She noted that some of the handlers also pickled pumpkins on sours like cucumber.
The Stravenka lump sum is planned by the Ministry from 2021. Taxation is unchanged
The I.M.F. is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for the diet directly. According to the I.M.F., a quarter of employees, or about a million people who do not receive meal vouchers, will benefit, according to the Ministry of Health.
However, according to the chairman of the Association of Voument System Operators, David Rýc, a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, such as importing food or an agreement with restaurants.
"The point of the intention is that we are not changing the tax advantage. It will also not be paid for health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. It added that the threshold for the maximum employer's maximum contribution applicable as the tax credit would also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal ticket. The remainder is paid for by the employee, in some cases paid for by the employer, but no longer paid for by the tax credit. The most advantageous value of the meal voucher for both employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayaking drivers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec as well as canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Canoe Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. The other three Czech representatives will be in Spain looking for a semi-final start in the afternoon's corrective qualifying run.
Vavřinec Hradilek failed from a strong representative group of kayakers, who was penalized for passing the goal at the start of the run for a 50-second penalty. He and Prskavec, on the other hand, can already rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I got the finish line up with the first run to the 30s, which I did. Not that I don't care how I turned out, because it starts very early in the morning on Sunday, so I was hoping to be a little bit higher to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising the comfort in Sea. "Before the watch race, I felt at the worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then in the race it was good and today it was better. It's beautiful, nice races here all the time, the crowd came, so fine," he smiled.
He was also happy with Prskavec. "In qualifying, one does not want to make a needless mistake. In the first few gates I didn't really get it. Then I did a great job of the middle, no problem, and I knew I had a mileage, so came the second mistake when I wanted to go down right and I turned the erucca. Overall, I can't be unhappy. The form is, we will see how it goes from there," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that they would go to the start at the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not a rinse bird, it's cold in the morning, and when you're here for eighth, it wants to have a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Cover. "Overall, it takes an hour and a half to the semi-finals, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Prskavec agreed.
Of the trio of Czech singles singles, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advancing score, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went the top of the game to my liking, in the middle passage it felt like I was late and not going as planned, but I was able to get into the comfort track I wanted to go. I made two jokers and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová said.
Coal will give way to both gas and core. Renewables will not cover the increased demand, says European ExxonMobil chief
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future demand for energy. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be replenished with additional alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the US-based ExxonMobil, one of the global oil drillers, says so. At the same time, he mentions that large repositories to store unused energy for later from days when both the sun and the wind are plentiful are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil centre in Prague, which houses 1,200 people, which is tasked with supporting the company's business activities and providing logistics and other services needed for the company's operation.
The Declaration of the End of the Right in the House or Jakápak the "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Reports have recently been appearing in the media and commentaries about the upcoming coalition of the parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I am more likely to ask why these parties are still calling themselves right-wing.
Leips about the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects are referred to by themselves or what the names are parroted by the mainstream media. The ODS, in its average of top politicians, is hardly a centrist one, with TOP 09 clearly the party of the city's pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism, and so hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, through its conception, ideology, and voter targeting, it essentially merges with TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU even labels itself in the long run as a centrist one - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.
Do you think I took everyone from one of the waters for a clean? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is individual freedom, the free market and minimal state interference with the life of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfill this general assumption of the right-wing? How many laws to slashing people's freedoms with a salami method, raising taxes, affirming new regulations and increasing oversight, increasing the link to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender madness have been supported in recent years? A lot, really a lot. Not their own labels, but the actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of decrees or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wing.
I would not be surprised at the Coalition Cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, on the political map, they simply belong together and, apart from the Christian or, conversely, the homosexualist and gender aspects in them for voters in the sense of the influence of the state on their lives, I don't see an obvious difference. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as the "only right-wing" and by linking it to the three entities, it is already openly revealing its true political assignment.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the labels. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite agree and cheaply refer to critics of dirigism and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Nor do they fail to understand that there are many people who are not as strongly comfortable with Eurosocialism and growing non-freedom as much as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not by chance hide their complete argumentative incompetence and the groundless or blind adoration of the Euro-EU conditions?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, other than centrist politics, has no chance of more success. Maybe the voters really want to connect like that. Perhaps they want the left-of-center politics under the guise of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or they can't even identify it). Dunno. But I am certainly not one of those voters.
The unveiled death of a little girl (†8) in Příbram: The culprit is not facing punishment
Undeterred cases are called "savings" in forensic slang. But they, too, are investigated if new information comes up years later. Especially when it comes to the death of the child. Criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley in Prague for 12 years. "A story from 1955? That's going to be tough, very hard. It would take a start to find a file, no longer have to exist, to talk to those who investigated. There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovic.
Under the previous regime, the public did not inform themselves about the violent crimes, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they were being investigated laxly. "It's always been up to specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although unfinished cases should not be shredded.
Lucie Bílá's father was not a fan of her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and his own name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when, as a young girl, she performed at a cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the warblock still lives.
"And I'll remember exactly where my mother was sitting. A singer was born in me that day," she admitted to Impulse radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future, recommending that she follow the path of the trade that has a golden bottom.
'My dad always said, 'Great girl, craft. Take your feet on the ground!' He even talked me into saying if I wanted to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks aren't working anymore, I kind of. I'm a trained seamstress and at home I make various rosaries and pendants out of beads, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs with the money," she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new myth is not at risk, reports the Kremlin. But the operator change is at play
The Ministry of Transport on Friday started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. This is a backup plan that would be used by the state if the current toll contract was finally cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing other makeshift solutions if it failed to complete the tender in time. This was made on Facebook by Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO).
The Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) on Thursday banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the consortium of the CzechToll/SkyToll consortium, with a one-year suspension. The Ministry will file an appeal against it.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the consortium CzechToll and SkyToll," the minister said.
The state would thus be looking for the tender to the operator of the currently planned myth, which will be launched from this December. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
According to the Kremlin, however, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not have made the new tender ready in time. "Based on the experience of the toll tender so far, I am deeply convinced that the OBR is mistaken and that within its 12-month period it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex procurement procedure and to hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a makeshift solution to resolve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state has found a full form of solution.
The state is unlikely to take up the offer made to it by the current toll manager Kapsch in recent days. The Austrian firm offered to operate the current system in case the toll contract were cancelled.
The Kremlin also reiterated that he believes a backup plan will not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
The OBR issued a decision on Thursday in which it prohibited the performance of the toll contract. But the ban will not take effect until a year after the Office's ruling becomes final. This is not final and may be appealed to the chairman of the Office against him. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator was won by the consortium CzechToll/SkyToll. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for the ten-year operation. The current operator, Kapsch, protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, having failed to offer over 13 billion crowns in the competition.
I still see myself as a guy who's just getting to see around, says Jan Cina
"That was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with an afro dance there. The way I have something Romani in me after my dad, it completely enrovises me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
Much fresher memories than the First Step series has a part of a painting in the new film, the National Mall. Cina revealed that director Stephen Altrichter must have been tempted by him a lot. "It was a challenging job, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Heavely and honestly, but also entertaining. It was filmed on National Avenue, where I drove as a non-driver. A lot was also shot at the South City in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is nominated for a Thalia Award for a role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the highlight of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a guy who's just getting used to it. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the top far ahead of me,' he said, noting that he had not even thought about the acceptance speech in the event of a victory. "Not really, but as a child, when I listened to the radio news shows, that's what I always imagined, talking to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What's his recipe for a happy relationship? "To enjoy each other and see the problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, reminiscing about the Czech Lions Awards when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He wore new slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So it wasn't long before he was on the ground. He could make it a priority. He had a workshop on Vanchur's Steps, where he taught how to fall safely down the stairs at the VIP events."
The zoo in Děčín rejoices in a small macaque
"Our band currently has seven members. Her youngest member was born on August 17, was born by a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father of the male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female carried the cub firmly pressed against the body, and for a long time she did not want to show the world whether she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of the cub's age, however, she has already started to put him away for a little while, and the nurses have known for a few days that it is a male," said zoo spokesperson Alena Houšková, noting that the zoo of Děčín has successfully bred 12 chicks of this species.
Makak's plumbing is the so-called endemic of Sulawesi, which means that they do not live in the wild elsewhere in the world. A typical feature is the black fur and plume on the head, according to which they have a name. Makak plucky live in the rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
They do as they do most primates with plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by the fruits of the forest trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves. The need for proteins is dealt with by eating small arthillas, larvae and, to a lesser extent, birds' eggs and chicks.
"If we nominate the natural enemies that are the pythons, everything else was written down by man. Local residents hunt the macaques as a popular prey with tasty meat and fur. It is also fatal for these animals to burn and to cut down the rainforest," the spokesperson said.
Germany reports the first case of the West Nile fever of the mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change
In addition to West Nonile fever, mosquitoes can also carry malaria, for example.
Germany on Friday reported the first case of a man infecting West Nile fever in German territory after being pinched by an infected mosquito. DPA reported the news. Until now, all the sick have contracted the virus while travelling or contacting sick animals. Experts say the breakthrough case of the disease is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said the virus was contracted by a 70-year-old man from Saxony. His disease was in serious progress and was treated at a hospital in Leipzig for brain inflammation. He's healthy now.
The West Nile fever virus was first demonstrated in 1937 in Uganda. In the meantime, it has spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe and, in the 1990s, the United States. Its wearers are mainly birds and mosquitoes, who infect with their infected blood.
Managers of state-owned companies are to newly undergo a selection process. The law will be circumvented, says the opposition
"This is a typical draft law that is unnecessary," said ODS deputy chairman Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved the changes to prevent opaque the distribution of functions in the future - critics speak of tobacconists - in state-owned companies. Newly, candidates should go through a selection process at the ministry and will also be considered by the Government Committee for Personnel Nominations.
However, it is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like, because it will reportedly allow ministers to make excuses for the possibility of a poor selection of state managers for the selection committee. In addition, the opinion of the aforementioned committee for the Minister will not be binding. The new one must still be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: Driver crashes near the village of Kokory: Died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident took place on Friday on the straight section between Přerov and the municipality of Kokory. The 28-year-old fabie driver couldn't handle the rut and drove off the road. The car rolled onto the roof and he was wedged underneath. He did not survive the injured injuries.
"According to the initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle travelling in the direction of Kokory outside the road went out of communication, where it rolled onto the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," police spokesperson Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
And where are the viewers? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, as the journey to Doha, the athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the stirring atmosphere at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and the European Championships in Berlin last year.
Giant banners on the walls of the skyscrapers in Doha invite the "greatest sporting event of 2019." However, the fear of how dignified the backdrop will be is mounting.
"Tickets for the target are sold out for all evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The top gallery of the Chalífa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with brightly colored sails, which also depict the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics went to a territory in Qatar where it has no roots, despite its annual Diamond League meeting.
So let's not be surprised that last week, a combined total of only 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the Championships, although their price started at 60 Qatari rivals, i.e. at a rate of less than 400 crowns.
The organisers have now set a target of filling the uncovered parts of the stands at least half. That is why, according to the British newspaper Giuardian's sources, (although the organisers themselves deny this) are reportedly handing out free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as children. Which Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can also comment positively: "That's how we can inspire future generations."
The rich Qatar has won the world championships in handball and cycling in the past, with football coming up in the 2022 after athletics. The oil superpowers, even for the wealthy sports federations, will always be lucrative. This is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accede to it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't help but wonder that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletes Championships in the Arabian Peninsule was supposed to be timed better - and for a different year. The extremely late term, coerced with climate, is hacked by the entire scheme of the pre-Olympic year's season and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start for the athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for it with technological innovations, with which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. That it's just 37 degrees? The stadium area is already being artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built in the blocks, are also supposed to give TV viewers detailed what takes place in the athletes in the hundreds of centuries of a second before and just after the starter's shot.
Sparta is really loaded this year, acknowledges Hradec beck Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Playing hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go on to play in Friday's match against the club where he recently played. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be similarly affected, albeit they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everybody wants to pull out against Sparta," says the Hradec back before the 5th extra-time match.
In it, Hradec Králové will try to stretch their series of wins, which at the moment is three consecutive three-point wins. After Kladno, Pilsen came the fans of the most appreciated on Sunday, Mountfield went for it in neighbouring Pardubice.
"But we can't watch the games that were. We need to focus on the matches ahead of us now and play in them the same way, if not better," the Hradec defender points out.
The Castle people should not look back at last year's record with Sparta. They lost in three of their four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, the Sparta management brought in some significant forwards in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what are we going to talk about, they are really charged this year," admits Nedomlel before the first game of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It responds to the direction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoin and ethery to the central bank and then to pay the builder's suppliers of the oil firm with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying a proposal for the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in the foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to the 30-year low. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
The sanctions imposed by the United States on President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This further deepened the economic crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in comparison globally, forcing officials to use a mixture of different ways of moving money. While Maduro's efforts to launch a state cryptocurrency as the world were the first to succeed, the ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither the Venezuela Central Bank nor PDVSA responded to the request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoin and ethers, nor how much of the value of these currencies it possesses. The company has problems obtaining payments from customers by conventional channels, as large banks are unwilling to trade with those subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the $700 million ($16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties failed to find financial institutions to make the transaction possible.
PDVSA may not be keen to sell cryptocurrencies in the open market, because it would require it to register on the stock market and submit to an in-depth check, the so-called due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and pay with it to the entities to which the PDVSA is owed. Officials at the oil firm believe the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that could arise when paying cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers are used to authenticate and record transactions by a decentralised online ledger known as blockchain. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are made possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of problems with money laundering and client information that are related to them and complicate compliance with the regulations.
Cryptocurrencies after the 2018 debacle are experiencing a return to the limelight this year thanks to the expectations of their greater adoption by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with their own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent in the last four days, but has a profit of about 130 percent since the start of the year.
Neckermann cancels all flights, involving five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of both the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, did not file the insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"However, CK Neckermann is forced to continue to cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, noting that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6. October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of the flights will affect around 500 clients. The 800 Neckermann clients who are abroad at the moment, "will be taken care of and are assured of their safe return to the Czech Republic on their scheduled flight."
The travel agency admitted that some of the clients had been asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for the clients to contact the CK Neckermann SOS line immediately," added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook's collapse occurred on Monday. Meanwhile, in August this year, the travel agency entered into a deal on the basis of which creditors were to inject £900 million into the company.
It was to receive half of the sum from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. It was to become majority owner as a majority owner on the basis of this. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, information surfaced as early as 20 September that creditors had demanded the traveler to raise the £200m reserve, or the deal would fall. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Under the bridge, someone killed a non-confrontational homeless woman. Police looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the evening until the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police appeal to possible testimony relates.
"Some of the drivers, who were driving on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or the street Pod Krejcárek, could have filmed the killer on a dash cam, for example. A witness might have just seen him and might have described him. In short, we will welcome any testimony to this case and receive it on line 158," said the spokesman for the regional police headquarters, Jan Daněk.
According to Daněk's spokesman, the homeless woman was murdered, did not drink alcohol and did not seek out the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "She most often moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she was carrying large blue shopping bags," added Daněk's description of the victim, who could also help potential witnesses.
Slovaks succeed, only to pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association has succeeded in appealing the stadium closure for the racism of the fans. The team was originally scheduled to play a European Championship qualifier with Wales without spectators, instead the union will only pay a fine of €15,000 (about $387,000).
The UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of the fans at the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which the visiting charges of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. The stadium was closed to both unseas for one match and fined the two unfinished euros by Slovakia by €67,000, while Hungary was fined €67,000.
The Slovaks, after the appeal, were only fined €15,000 for offensive political shouting. The most successful national team match in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales 10. October in Trnava will thus be made available to fans.
Basketball players failed to reach the medal of the Under-17 Championship, finishing fourth
The third World Championships of 17 were also won by the Americans, who beat Spain just 77-75 in the final, despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvado draw.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't hold on because they rolled us under the basket," said captain Karolína Malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an unreal experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two three-pointers and dominating the first quarter on the pitch. At that moment, it seemed that he would repay their opponents with a qualifying group defeat in the 85-88 after extra time. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary back into the game with a 12-2 draw with contentious decisions.
"I'm sure it was enough to put the other two or three baskets, to run to 20 points, and we wouldn't have let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent get caught," said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we'd had a lapse in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't release anything and fought to the end. But the opponent was very good quality," he added.
The Czechs were particularly kept in the game by Petr Holešínská with accurate shooting from the distance and by the pivotka Tereza Šípová. However, the Czech scorer's best shot had a problem with fouls and missed a large part of the third quarter on the pitch. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they had already held, despite the Czechs fighting until the final seconds.
"For the first five games it was very difficult for us, we turned the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. Against Spain, you could see that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to go. We weren't consistent with the defense because of the physique. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we missed a rebound. And the Hungarians are of such quality that if you don't get everything together, you can hardly win," Fousek added.
He believes his trustees have a promising future. "In two years, the girls have managed to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the European 16-year-old's European Championships, and now they are fourth in the world. By our standards, it is a quality team with a good character and it is necessary to continue to work with and develop talent. Now it is up to the federation, which the coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories," Fousek added.
End of political tobacconists? The new law, according to critics, won't help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to play into depriving ministers of responsibility for the election while continuing to select their candidates.
Greater transparency in the selection procedures for posts in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 MPs were in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of YES, KSČM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through a selection process before the government committee. The Pirates, for example, were seeking to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't work out in the end.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD are concerned that the nomination law will be uploading to ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide for some of the commission's decisions and will therefore not have a clear transparent responsibility," SPD chairman Tomio Okamura thinks. ODS Vice-President Martin Kupka also speaks.
The GOP Committee should reject candidates who do not meet the conditions in full. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free debt, a minimum age of 25 and expertise should also be the main selection criterion.
The bill will still have to go through the Senate and then get it to be signed by the president.
Tough competition for Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed is betting on a wealth of equipment, at what cost?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult-to-classify model. It is clearly among the compact SUVs, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves the larger Sportage sibling, which is as direct to cars such as the Škoda Karoq, the Opel Grandland X or the Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also bets on the more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the back can remotest remotely of the world of SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market, especially among the premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be included only alongside the rinsed versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, the Koreans made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so who doesn't want to see the news in the shapes of the news may not even be seen.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed estate, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric 14-seat. The XCeed launches with a supercharged litre and also offers a 150 kW supercharged 16-cylinder, reserved for the GT siblings. Don't expect a sports level here. Turbodiesels 1.6 CRDi is only available in mild-hybrid design, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps with reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon the range will grow by a plug-in hybrid, a variant that travels roughly six tens of kilometers just for electricity. The battery can then be charged from a normal socket.
Simona Krain: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia White!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar (translated M*dat age) Simona Krainová posted her latest photos of her completely naked! "I was a little afraid of people being condemn, that I was taking naked pictures when I was my age. I'm a shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, it's possible to have a solid figure at the age of 46. Of course, it's hard work and renunciation, but there's no other way."
"Lukáš Dvořák and I took about three thousand pictures, selected about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for its moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked," confided the Lightning model, who came to her baptism very exposed.
She had an extended jacket from Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they couldn't be seen, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. The day-to-day jogging tightened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so pleased with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening. Husband, friends, even Slavic Lucie Bílá.
Carrotist brought voice of digital soul
Everything you know about obesity is wrong, says the headline of the long text, written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative illumination then states that for decades the medical community ignored the facts of obesity and waged a fierce (and also useless) war against overweight people who not only marked public opinion but also destroyed a lot of lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes puts at the outset is that from knowledge and knowledge of the facts to putting into practice is often a very long and tedious journey. He mentions the case of scorpions, with some captains handing out lemons, limes, and oranges to their garb to their crew in the seventeenth century, believing that they would prevent the diseases. However, the British Navy withdrew from the practice because of concerns about the increased cost. The clear effect of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the navy to consider it. Even the seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but it did not become mandatory until the 1960s, as did the first confirmed asbestos-related deaths, dating back to 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every discovery in the public health field - and no matter how important it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial incentives within the society into which it was to be implemented," writes Hobbes. In American society, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and around one-third of children now meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Meanwhile, obesity is seen as a supremely personal failure of an individual who is claimed to be burdensome for the health service and reduces GDP. The fear of fat is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. But the truth is that diets don't work. As far back as 1959, research showed that between 95 and 98% of attempts to lose weight by failure, and two-thirds of people on the diet would subsequently gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes also describes the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. Here, personal meets systemic, where, for example, at faculties, when teaching future doctors, he devotes just 19 hours of nutrition issues from the whole study. Which, at a time when the 60 calorie process that Americans are receiving comes from ultra-processed food - that is, over-processed food.
Obesity stigmatized, in turn, is illustrated by reports from surgeruses where overweight people usually experience shorter examinations, doctors approach them with less empathy, and view them as more problematic patients.
But overweight is far from the American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980 the share of obesity in 73 countries around the world has doubled and it has grown in the 113. And in that time, no country has managed to shrink and stop the increase. Absolutely none.
Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of price hikes for tickets
The most expensive item is the freelance fee each year before the Grand Prix. This year, it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno at the Grand Prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the legging fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the plant is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno doesn't have so much of the world's tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors there as well as from abroad. For Brno, it is as important as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the Exhibition Centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- cost of the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money to organize, an increasing leaching fee for the Dorna promoter
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of the advertising space, increase the price of tickets
- current state: negotiations for a new contract for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix is draining money from public budgets for other matters. But to a certain extent, it is a political and not an economic question," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motorsport event may be even higher. In fact, the option of increasing the enrollment fee is almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the race. Should the worst-case scenarios come to fruition, I fear it is not realistic for the city and the county to pay the sum," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As the daily Equality reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno due to difficulties in obtaining money for the Grand Prix are also discussing the possibility of using advertising. "The condition of Dorna is that the advertisement must be placed in places that are not taken up by the cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then the company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor," Vaňková explained.
Organisers can also get more money from tickets in the years to come. "We've got to sit down and say what the cost is going to be. And we have to adapt the revaluation of tickets to that," said the opposition ANO representative and former Mayor Petr Vokřál.
D5 accident: Freeway closed by collision between trucks
The incident was reported at about 08:00 at the 22nd kilometre in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight transport. Passenger cars can go through the gas station," police spokesperson Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. The preliminary damage, according to Richter, is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident is being investigated by officers.
A spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire department, Petr Svoboda, said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other with a plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the vehicles transported were shifted, which firefighters had to first arrange against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank that leaked about 200 liters of diesel fuel. Another 200 litres were drained by the firefighters. The accident was called to the accident for the escape of the fuel by the environmental department of the Beroun City Council. The recovery of the crashed vehicles and the freeway was cleared by a private firm, which also extracted contaminated soil.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800 metres and the ranking of the carmaker Romana Maláčová and the hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková did not make it through, defending the eighth place she had surprised in London the previous year.
The run on Friday will be attended by the hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Safrankova threw a third attempt of 65.46 metres and fell almost six metres short of her year's best, which she would have to improve on the progress. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was beyond her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to climb the 460 cm limit.
Muzicanikova, who reached the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF International Federation, finished in fourth with the penultimate run in the penultimate sixth, and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to advance to the semi-finals. She trailed her year's best by one and a half seconds. "It was pretty quick for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent on the bend there, which kind of robbed me of my strength. I felt like I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start running again, so this was a little awkward. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech representative.
She was glad to have overtaken at least one opponent at the finish line. "She really wasn't well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she said. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie Nanyond of Uganda in 2:00.36.
The best eight-time female eight-hundred-year-old in the last few years, Caster Semenya, is missing from South Africa, who has too high herat testosterone levels in her body, but, like some other runners, is refusing to receive the treatment ordered by IAAF rules since this year.
In the 100 metres heats, the number one favourite was confirmed by American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one to come under the ten-second mark. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is seeking to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semifinals. The start was not played by Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is number two in this year's standings with a 9.86 and was expected to face Coleman, who has a 9.81 to play this season.
He showed great form in the qualifying of longtime long jumpers Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría, who flew to a distance of 840 cm in the first jump. No athlete has jumped so far in the qualifying World Championships for the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's standings with an output of 865 cm.
French Oskara Les Misérables candidate to launch Be2Can parade
The Golden Bear and both winners of this year's Berlinale, the Cannes Journey and Jury Prize will be presented with the 6th annual festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, too, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and inspiring things that have presented the competitions of the three most important European Film Festivals.
The opening film of this year's show will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly took the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The preview of the film in Prague will be presented in person by the representatives of the two main roles of the criminal unit police officers, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-author of the film's screenplay.
Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas in Prague, as well as in Brno (the Art Forum), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8. October.
Director Ladj Ly's directorial feature debut was released and awarded at a number of other world festivals after his success at Cannes. He won the IFF Durban Award for Best Picture and Best Screenplay Award, as well as the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be shown in San Sebastián.
As part of the festival, however, the audience can also look forward to the films Synonym, The Young Ahmed, The Intruder of the System, Goodbye, My Son, Sorry, We have not caught up with you, The Anthology of the City of Ghosts and the Golden Glove. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to Czech distribution: sci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of the Painted Bird.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed a well-known rumour for days: Canada has revoked honorary citizenship for the former legend of the fight for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Barmany), who spent years under house arrest for her country to bring freedom, lost her honor for her honor because of her involvement in genocide against the Rohingya minority nation.
The decision to take honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and the senators have now unanimously endorsed it. "This is the right message for both her and Myanmar and the world," commented the decision of her colleagues, the independent senator Ratna Omidvar. "We must make it clear that the co-conspirators of the genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, however, it is a strong message for her on a symbolic level. The silence of a longtime human rights activist for atrocities that the Army of the majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for months with the Muslim Rohingya minority is unbearable.
The fact that there is an officially organised genocide in Myanmar, and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the country's government - has completely failed in the obligation to protect its citizens has been brought about by the UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - "shock both by the terrifyingness of their actions and in a huge scale." Su ivy and its administration under management, according to the United Nations, committed an accessory primarily by protecting the soldiers' actions to cover and launch the fog around them with the protection of lies - such as a "counter-terrorism operation."
After the redelegation of Suu Kyi, five personalities remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karima Aga Khan IV, 49. imams of Shiite Muslims and Malal Yussufzai.
The developments surrounding the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy were also reflected by the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information about the atrocities against the Rohingya was added to the profile of Suu Kyi and the parliamentary decision to take her title as an honorary citizen. "We have also dampened the illumination of her pictures on the blackboard showing the timeline of the fight for human rights and are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," the Canadian media quotes the museum's spokesman, Rorie McLeod, as saying.
The only thing that will remain in the current upheaval of Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the fight for democracy. "While the current actions of Ms. Suuu Kyi are regrettable, her award will not be annulled," the head of the Nobel Foundation, Lars Heikensten, told Canada's CBS.
Microplastics have reached the human intestines, the study confirmed for the first time
Scientists have been confirmed with years of suspicions. The team, led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwabl, published a study that first proves the presence of microplastics in the human stool. While the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, small particles of plastics measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in samples of all the individuals surveyed. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them did not avoid marine fish, all drinking plastic-packed water and plastic-packaged food.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are made either directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the disintegration of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and lemonades; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive tract of man was only officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 particle amounts of microplastics per ten grams of faeces, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, both layman's and scientific awareness suspects that this is not a good thing. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and the effect microplastics have on "hostern" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind, and it confirmed what we have thought for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate exactly what this means to human health," Schwabl says.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And there is no known solution other than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. This will be difficult, however, - the first task faced by governments and the authorities will at least stop its steep rise. As far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years, mankind will consume a fifth more than it does today. The current pace is a stirring million bottles bought per minute. Every year, some eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive marine systems.
Some states have already taken restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example - under threat of draconian punishments - banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws) and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures, while they are pretty, are wholly inadequate.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she caused a stir when she visited Africa and, in particular, the minefield. The images, on which he is wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face, have become iconic. And no one could have known then that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would breathe a last breath in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Her younger son, Harry, had now scored a mark on his way to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine removal post in Diric, Angola, and also put on a special protective suit, looking very thoughtful. He certainly couldn't resist remembering his beloved mother, who he lost at just 13.
Harry had a speech on the scene, where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to disable the minefields and other explosives in the countries where the war took place. "The minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them, we can help the community to find the peace with which it also comes to opportunities," he said, also appealing to the rescue and maintenance of the wilderness and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huambo to rename the local orthopedic centre after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honoured to visit a place and a community that was important enough for his mother to get acquainted with their tireless mission and speak to everyone she (Diana) thought they most needed to be heard, even though the problem was not popular worldwide," a post on the Sussex Royal Instagram.
The royal fans may be frozen by the fact that he did not take his wife, Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months), to such an expedition to remember Diana. They both have had a separate program for Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a small baby into a minefield, he doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to threaten his beloved family at any price.
Individuals. We don't have a reproduction, but we don't have to haunt
Some words have unfortunate connotations, though they just tell the state of affairs. They include the word only child. He refers to a child growing up without siblings, but he does not sound neutral. "You know, an only child," it says, with nothing to add. Interestingly, this trait has been borne by the "single" since time of time, back from the days when terms as demographic crisis were widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is required to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state achieves this value in Europe today. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but the simple level of population reproduction is not assured by European states. (Within the West, only Israel is out of the ordinary fertility of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation like a done for alarmism. That's why it's no surprise when even the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Maláčová, is also sinking for him: "There are almost as many individuals as children's families," she said in an interview with the LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in the detail.
Yes, it is good when the problem is drawn to the attention of the problem instead of downplayed or ideologized. Like in Germany, where a campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "that's what Hitler supported it"). It is good to be reminded that many couples of children plan directly. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (perhaps the weak expansion of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But let's just point out one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many people," there is a drop of demagogy. The statement was appropriate 20 years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic was last provided with simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). It then declined to a formidable 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty per cent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, a European above-average. It is not yet enough for a simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is in order. Only with the alarmism can they take a little less.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
The title was given to Costa Rica for several reasons. For starters, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but a lot of countries have pledged to do so under the Paris Agreement. The Central American nation, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 per cent of taxis buses or cars to run on electricity.
The official tourist organization says that already around 95 percent of its energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017 Costa Rica operated for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
The increase in emissions is also contributed by the density of the afforestation. The rainy forests with its diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "The costume is a pioneer in nature conservation and gives the example to other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot, given the country's small size (51 100 square kilometers). Rain or misty forests, coral reefs or mangroves swampes are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls, and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
Shared to the planet. In Prague, the Scientists' Night Begins
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Medical Faculty, to which there is no access to the public at other times," advises the National Coordinator of Scientists' Night, Jitřenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try out the work with surgical instruments.
"Then I would have run to the CWU and watch the film The Green Desert," Navratilova adds. Guided tours will also be offered by nine laboratories. The slogan of this year's Scientists' Night is "sacquiring to the planet."
Attorney General resumes prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Attorney General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of her mother, who has long manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering upbringing. The district court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. In a similar conduct, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a criminal offence can be seen.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary from the point of view of directing further application practice," according to Zeman's appeal.
The Svitavy District Court first found the woman guilty last year of abusing a person in charge as well as endangering the upbringing of a child. She and her daughter were creating a solid, even symbiotic, even in a situation in which she was to be entrusted with her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation was marked by the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm in the event of being handed over to the care of her father.
The Svitav court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year non-parole period. The Pardubice branch of the regional court, however, acquitted the woman on appeal, saying it is not a criminal offence. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court after the Supreme Court had already ordered him to rule again.
The regional court found that situations where one parent is manipulating a child against another is not uncommon. It is dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or social protection authorities of youth. Only rarely is the solution to criminal law.
According to the Attorney General, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangering her upbringing. "The accused was quite targeted when she aroused negative feelings about her father in her daughter, and purposefully reinforced these negative emotions. By doing so, she not only pursued an illegal intention to restrict or exclude a father's intercourse with a minor, but she must have been necessarily aware that this would provoke negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," the appeal reads.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to refer the case back to the regional court once more. The appeal implies that the child is now in the care of the father.
Step back, he called on Schiller for words about the opposition scum of Czernin
"I find it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such a totalitarian statement anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir in the discussion of the draft constitutional action against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the draft constitutional action brought up by the Senate was thrown off the table by the MPs.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like spending taxpayers' money here, hitting empty straw. And I even dare, I don't use hard terms, to quote one of them: It's opposition and senatorial filth," the Chancellor of the Exchequer said.
"These terms were hailed by the Nazis of Jewish citizens and the Communists of their political adversaries. It is the rhetoric of the totalitarian, without a hint of respect for the man and the opinion," wrote the minister's deputy chairman TOP 09, Czernin, who will compete for the party's chairman in the autumn with the current first vice-chairwoman, Markéta Pekarová Adamová.
"I've been quoting one of the many reports I've received dozens of in the course of the House. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal defamation we witnessed in domestic politics on a daily basis, which was also the main motive for Thursday's House session. The fact that someone applies to one's term to themselves surprises me," Schillerová responded to the Czech News Agency.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 college students in Ayotzinapa disappeared, and despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been cleared up. The students were alleged to have been detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened after that, according to the investigation, but the students appear to have ended up in the hands of the local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, reports APTN.
A memorial procession was held in the capital of Mexico on Thursday, with families wanting to express their frustration that it was still impossible to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
But the mostly calm march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, destroying everything in their path. Vandals were destroying shops and hotels, not shy about destroying monuments, setting fires around the city and blowing out windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do his best to catch and asked the public for any information that would lead to the clarification of the case.
Over 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but neither of them have been convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly were supposedly tortured by the suspects, APTN adds.
Mahulena Bochanova interrupted the one-year detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bochan confided in Lightning that she had quit alcohol. "On holiday, I thought I'd give my old, garlanded 50-year-old's body a breath. I've given myself a deadline forever. I feel very rested, I have a lot of energy and, most of all, my psyche has improved. I haven't been well mentally in it lately. I get up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, money.'
She said her a year's abstinence was enough and the actress found her way to alcohol again. "Sometimes I'll have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I've done before. I'll have one drink and have fun until morning. I've got a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed the non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," said Mahulena, who still forms a couple with the Brno businessman Petr.
Bochanová also returned to the theatre season after the holidays and will newly enter the series Ordinace in the Rose Garden. "I'm ashamed of the first two shows, I was really bad, I was overtelling. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He is mainly happy
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not be alarmed by any questions. On his show Call and Write to the Boss, he publicly comments on various topics. Nor is he strangers to the tabloid cases he glosses about, sparkly and wittily. Although he wasn't laughing about this time.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karl got sick and said it fair, without having to dig it down somewhere by tabloids. I don't want to comment, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I would like him, of course, a successful treatment and, of course, a calmness! The peace he needs now," the TV owner Barrandov said.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And she waited for the news the Master himself chooses to provide to the media. I don't even much like the various expressions that his old friends and various celebrities think of his health. And I can say for our media that we will only address his illness and his person if he shows himself an interest. To me, the other media should consider a similar approach."
Young Czechs think they know how to do it with money. Survey did not confirm this
"It turns out, then, that young Czechs have a bit more confidence in their knowledge of finances than is reality. Women and respondents without a high-end maturity had a significantly larger share of the wrong answers in this case," said Jaroslava Palendalová, director of KRUK.
His knowledge of financial products is more likely to be believed by men and young high school students or college students.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), the internet's self-study (23 percent) and only the third row in school lessons (21 percent).
Questions about finance are mainly consulted with female parents, while information online is more sought by men. The extraction of information about finances from parents is predominant in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Practically minimal influence is the prospectuses of financial institutions, professional journals and publications.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all the main areas of life, is proving. That is why the level of financial literacy of parents who pass on their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key," Palendalová said.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 per cent of young people.
Young people are clearly on the question of whether it is better to save and buy their own house or apartment, for example, or to enjoy and spend the money, without saving and living their own.
The strategy of savings and investment in long-term tangible assets is espoused by 94 percent of those surveyed. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The strategy of the investigation is then 100% espoused by people in a marital union with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, it is more like people living living alone and with an income of over CZK 30,000 per month.
Hunter injured in a fall from a sitting, carrying him to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before 7:30 p.m. in the top parts at the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we dispatched five of our rescuers to the injured man with the proper technique. At the same time, we asked for cooperation from the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. Paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, dispatcher of the Mountain Rescue Service of the Beskydy Mountains, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the hunters in a pinpointed locality with multiple injuries. He was immediately treated and then gently, but with difficulty transporting him on the so-called Austrian cart through the impassable terrain.
"Transport on the route of about a kilometer and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the ambulance crew after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
Fortunately, according to Radan Jaškovský, the commissioned chief of the Mountain Rescue Service of Beskydy and the intervening rescuer, a fellow hunter was able to describe in detail the whereabouts of the injured.
"We found it relatively quickly. However, if he had had the Záchranka app on his phone, our rescuers would have been with him sooner, and at the same time he would have known about the accident and its situation immediately by the dispatching of line 155," noted Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with the activated app, Rescue should be commonplace in the mountains today.
Zeman by the monument - The man of the tension of the Institute calls for law enforcement
Those who move in the camp's divided society and don't want to be completely fooled will welcome situations where they don't have to root for their own. When he can admit the pluses to whoever he otherwise criticizes. For one thing, so that he doesn't feel like he's just oriented by the previously assigned stickers. Such situations include a list of badly damaged monuments by which President Zeman fences during his favourite trips to the regions.
Everybody knows what's going on. And who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic, sees a number of those devastated monuments - from the centres of historical towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farmhouses - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagogy can come to the word here, too. That if we reproach the town hall for not receiving monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it could be the work of the former administration. Or a privatized object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state of local politics calls on: "The Parsagraf of the Heritage Act allows you to fine the owners of objects who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is unseesible, it must be admitted that the President calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending constitution should be seen as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman considering all the details and formalities of the complex problem. But he stands up for a good cause, like squatters, whom he doesn't recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the swearing, squatters point out the problem of outside the current interest. For the fact that this or that structure is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is doing de facto the same thing.
If you come to the historical centre of Jáchymov, you marveled at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Joachimov celebrates 500 years of silver and minting of dollars for the mines of silver and minting dollars. What for? They say it's because of the quick-fled sale of houses in the '90s, officials there say. But how is it that seven kilometres away the Island, the seat of the Shushkas who minted the Jachmov tolars, has the historic core nicely repaired? It is good if the President draws attention to these things.
Babiš in memorial to the victims of the terror called for security cooperation
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monica visited a memorial to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City on September 11, 2001, by Ground Zero.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all the world's nations should fight together against. At the end of the US's five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said so today at the New York City Memorial of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. The Prime Minister honoured the memory of two victims of Czech origin on this occasion.
"It's a very moving place," the Prime Minister said, accompanied by his wife Monica, laying a white rose on the names of Lukáš Rambousko and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2750 dead who were claimed by the attack by the hijacked planes on the former pair of World Trade Center skyscrapers (WTC). The towers of the World Trade Center collapsed after the crash, with a memorial in their place now with a name list of victims.
"It is necessary to remind yourself of what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The attack on the US on September 11, 2001 was described by the prime minister as a reason for the UN to work together in a unified campaign against international terrorism. The terrorists then crashed the kidnapped Aircraft into the Defense Department's Washington-based bombardment in the Defense Department, in Washington, in addition to destroying the WTC skyscraper, and were planning to strike another strike on a target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. But this aircraft crashed when the passengers of the hijackers were confronted.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.
Slovenians beat Polish world champions and are in the final of the European Championships
Slovenian volleyball players will be sensationally playing for the European Championship's premier title. With the support of nearly 12,000 storming fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions defeated the Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in the climax in Paris on Sunday will be decided between France and Serbia on Friday.
The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. They were only the start of the opening set and with luck to the finish of the second set, but the home volleyball team outdid the defence and the players in the red and white jersey were basically scored only by the native of Cuba, León.
But in the home line-up, both the dunkes of Chetick and Urnaut presented themselves in the form of their life, as well as the second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the unimpressive Gasparini. The Poles paid for winning all previous matches at this Euros in the sovereign way, while the Slovenians gained confidence after heavy playoff battles with both the Bulgarians and the Russians.
The Slovenians lost 1-3 to the Poles in the Olympic qualifiers in Gdansk this August, but were beaten at home. But now he will leave the sold-out Ljubljana Arena, Stožica. However, they have already had a second medal in their history after today, in Paris they can improve the unexpected silver from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championships, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history has been somewhat dug up. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man, "What we are perhaps witnessing... is the final point of human history and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are rather witnessing the more than illiberal models winning from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are thriving. The current ninth Fukuyama book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment attempts to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview with George Eathon shows for the New Statesman, he rethinks many of his former views: he argues that the ideas of socialism should be back to the public domain, and Marx was right about much. While he also insists that his thought development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics of the End of History and the Last Man is said to have not been understood correctly.
"What I said at the time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that it provides for peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracy does not even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the point of association, and therefore grouping together according to the identity that give them a sense of belonging."
In its day, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who, as the final stage of history, perceived communism. When asked by Fukuyama how he now perceives the rise of the Socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about owning the means of production, then except when the public's clear services are demanded, I don't think that will work. But if you mean redistributive programs that attempt to address the huge imbalance in the income and wealth that we are witnessing, then yes. I don't think he'd just come back, he should come back. The long period, launched by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the floor, had in many ways a disastrous effect."
Finally, Fukuyama is trying to calm the current situation, and all the liberals are warned that the emergence of new not-quite-democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
The soldiers are rehearsing, pull the drapes. China to hold celebrations at the site of the massacre
The Army rehearsed the parade during the recent weekends. Shops in the centre of Beijing had to close, and residents near the square were ordered to close their drapes. Military cars pouring into the square and rolling in the sky with warplanes.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud to display their countries with their military strength. But one woman said it was difficult to deny that the celebrations would be unsettled by other states.
She was apparently referring to Taiwan, which China claims and where the election is imminent. But they may also be worried in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, in which thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against China as a senior administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The South China port of Xiaone had already put out a special light show on Thursday night. The Xiammen is opposite to the island's Taiwan and is among the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things grows. It already features drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio-wave devices, The Guardian reported. He added that China's popular social network, Weibo, erases "harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who deals with China. "It's a moment when a party can demonstrate order, control, and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, won the nationalists in a fight with Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the Tiananmen Square regime of Tiananmen tank-shows massacred thousands of pro-democratic demonstrators from among students and workers.
Since the late 1970s, China has been increasingly taking over the elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, the blend of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickens) capitalism (exploitation of workers) is now a mixture of the worst of the country.
Czechs or children's entry forbidden. Choi discriminates in restaurants
These included, for example, erroneous information about prices and non-compliance with the principles of fairness of sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to let smaller children into the establishment. On his website, according to the CTIA, he writes that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "To the consumer's electronic inquiry, whether it is possible to book a table for four adults and one child at the age of four in the mentioned restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that the restaurant does not accept the presence of children under the age of eight," Fröhlich said.
In the second case, another Prague business did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while allowing it to the English-speakers. "Czech inspectors, in the position of consumer, was not allowed to sit at a table in a restaurant and make an order. English-speaking consumers have been allowed this," a spokesperson for the CHI described the situation.
Both cases are now dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they are not yet terminated, the inspection spokesman could not give further information on the mentioned restaurants.
Discrimination, however, occurred only in a very small proportion of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it revealed other errors in 64 cases. These were mostly shortcomings in respecting the principles of fairness of sales and not informing the consumer of the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Earlier on Wednesday, the inspection reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged amounts higher than the Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been issued.
A holiday with a credit card only? The NEO account offers free ATM withdrawals around the world!
Directly paying by card has already been used to by card by roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad. The main reasons include in particular comfort, safety, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with the credit card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travellers in almost every corner of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, don't have time to go to the exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even "vacoters" don't want to rely on the fact that the cash will get by. Moreover, some foreign currencies do not even have Czech banks or currency exchange offices. We have therefore solved this with the NEO account so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communications and press spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way than in cash not to lose its money. With the loss of a wallet full, its owner may not see the money he brought in it. However, if it loses only its debit card, it can easily be blocked immediately by phone or via internet banking. In a quick negotiation, he may not suffer any financial loss at all. "Kinding money in a bank account has other benefits in addition to protecting it reliably. For the NEO account, for example, it is an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among both current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit the branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to €100,000 and the account is absolutely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. The option to arrange it and pay by card online can be done even at the last minute. However, the ownership of a credit card alone often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with the MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business embossed cards, travel insurance is an integral part of the country in foreign trips to all countries around the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with which they travel. They often lack any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to verify the extent of the insurance, i.e. whether it applies to all the activities that the travellers are planning to undertake.
We're looking for motivated immigrants. The lead of the children's clinic is building an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
Ledjona Toni, an Albanian, studied medicine in Czech, and today few will know she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad are studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. Some of them were attempted by a pediatric clinic in Motol, Prague.
To arrive at the Motol Motol Hospital in Prague around 5 p.m. to get up. A chicken woman with her short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleymania, a city in northeast Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in a hospital and treats small patients in private practice in the afternoon. He also teaches at the university.
Spilk in the par. Indianapolis is on the verge of promotion after the first round
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of reaching the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys, and finished the opening day at par with par. With a result of 72, it is tied for 69th, which is the expected cut.
Spilková, 24, returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month health break and failed to make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took the rest because of fatigue and exhaustion after a previous illness.
The first Czech winner of the professional tournament for the European LET series is a first-year member of the LPGA Tour and is not doing very well so far. She made the cut three times in 12 tournaments, the best of which was 32. in Hawaii. He is struggling to keep his card for another season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by the Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, he scores -9 and a two-shot lead over a trio of opponents.
Prague Stock Exchange rose slightly, doing well for Czech banks, O2 or Avast
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a modest rise. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45. He was pulled up by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 or technology firm Avast. On the contrary, Austrian titles and media company CME failed. This is clear from the trading results on the stock exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in a slightly positive territory and eventually finished with a small profit. "However, he lost slightly over one percent (the PX index) all week," said Josef Dudek of Fio banka.
Domestic banks have partially corrected the declines from the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 per cent to CZK 72.80. Avast's shares were up 0.89 percent at CZK 113, and O2's operator added 0.46 per cent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. The tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640, were raised less than a percentage.
The securities of the energy firm ČEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 crowns.
Three titles were lost - Erste Bank was off 0.87 percent to CZK 779.20, CME 0.73 per cent to CZK 109 and insurer VIG 0.40 per cent to CZK 618.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four pennies to 25.85 CZK/EUR by the euro, and three halves to the dollar at 23.62 CZK/USD. This is according to data on Patria Online.
My heart is like a bell and a non-smoker's lungs. I'll just have some IVs, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent a several-hour medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "challenging conditions" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
The president's doctors at the check revealed mild signs of dehydration. His low-pressure problems were caused by the inadequate irrigation. "To fix the dehydration of the organism, I will take a few infusions that will get into my body by the minerals," Zeman said.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president." The president mentioned in this context that Zavoral had received some hate messages for the medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single place on the body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if he were not a smoker, the liver works as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are fine too and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's health statement.
The question of Zeman's health became an issue primarily at the time of last year's presidential election or in some public appearances in which Zeman has a clear problem with his walk. According to Prague Castle, the president is walking badly because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and hears it harder. Because of his health, he reduced smoking.
Scientists search for toddholatons with birth defects, called ankhnae valgosy, in their study
The valgosita (towing) of the ankles is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of the children. By default, they are treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special footwear that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototype shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with diagnosed to map the effect for both groups. Participation in the research will have no risks for the children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimun, head of research at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both children's groups can report to the study via the web, where the registration form and all the information are available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children diagnosed and fifty healthy children. From each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should enroll their child is when they embark on their first separate steps, typically embarking on the furniture they follow while trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements in the course of seven months from the first steps of the child, each taking about 20 minutes, for half of the participants it also includes wearing the tested footwear," Gimun points out.
Pike in a pond, or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view of statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), a low unemployment rate, a low level of unemployment, a low national debt. Or the figure that our country is, according to one recent study, the 24th in quality of life from the 140 countries evaluated.
In a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and the Development Summit, Dušan Kunovský, the developer Dušan Kunovský and the architect Josef Pleskot, reported other, in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit, however, as well as not as "pink" data. For example, the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" does not leave behind any significant builders' heritage, as it has in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic lags significantly in the overall quality and performance of public administration for developed countries.
Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are rising, people with a better standard of living will also want to have a place to live, modern and quickly travel, to have quality cultural stalls, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.
But for example, in the capital city of Prague, the inner and outer ring roads have not been completed for years, or to build a speedway or a metro to the airport. Nor does Prague have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall, or a national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd wrangling over architectural competitions, land-use plans and building permits, but also a kind of specific Czech conservatism that adheres to the slogan "each more daring change is for the worse."
And when it seems that something more daring might be done, it will almost certainly be thwarted by preservationists or other somewhat stubborn associations, or by politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding the "blockbush" of Jan Kaplický, designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the backpackers.
The list, however, does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor is it able to start building train speedways, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "track" through Bavaria. In addition, the shenanigans are sometimes heated by repairs of existing infrastructure. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is a puzzle now.
Babiš came to politics with a promise to "them people to arrange." As for meaningful investments and the acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, much has happened so far. An amendment to the Act on Accelerating the Construction of Transport Infrastructure has been in force since 2018, but we will have to wait for more extensive positive impacts, for example, to facilitate the expropriation of land. And the new building code, approved by the government, which is said to be to reduce the current average construction workflow from 5.4 to one year, will start to apply from 2021, if we are lucky. But a lot of people probably wouldn't bet on it.
Unexpected wants 45 million from the state
The Justice Ministry, according to the spokesman of the office, Vladimír Řepka, has received six applications in this connection so far and is now analysing them. The teenager was in prison for assaulting the woman for two years, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by both Attorney General Pavel Zeman and Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradecká prosecutor's office accused the then 20-year-old student of the Egraduate Gymnasium. The prosecution claimed that he had hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life saved by the doctors at the Hradec hospital.
Uncombed from the outset, he denied any wrongdoing. "I'm innocent, and I swear. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he had been in the salon's house on the fateful day, said earlier in court. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him she was closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as an aggressor at the time of the interrogation, but later called the Aboriginal an attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradecký Regional Court gradually handed down five sentences in the case. First, he found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, the appeals High Court reduced his sentence to 13 years. The uncombed gradually headed behind bars twice, but each time he was freed after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After a court-ordered exchange, repeatedly acquittals were eventually handed down, with the last one upheld by the High Court in March this year.
However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the grounds of his findings that the decision was wrong, but he said he had no better choice in view of the procedural situation. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this is not that there is a lack of evidence, but an assessment of it. We believe that sufficient evidence was gathered in the pre-trial proceedings that would be more than enough in other criminal cases to be found guilty," Lněnička stated.
But the Hradec, but also the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not be changed by further overturning the acquittal.
Epilepsy has made his love of sport difficult for him, thanks to the surgery she has a new hope
Honzik's parents first noted that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He would always stare into the space for a few minutes, to stand still, and not respond to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to a pediatric neurological clinic, where doctors, after a series of examinations, gave him a diagnosis of epilepsy and immediately put in medication, but they did not immediately work.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of medication that made it completely impossible to have seizures. At the age of five, doctors dropped his medication off, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to the sport. He cycled, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and his friends. But he had another seizure at the age of 11 and it all started all over again.
Doctors tried various medication combinations again, but this time nothing worked up, the abscaleten seizures kept recurring. As Honza always stopped perceiving in the seizure, his parents were terrified that he would get it in sports and get hurt. Gradually, Honza stopped riding his bike and traded downhill skis for cross-country skis and snowboard. Although the sport had a seizure from time to time, he never gave up completely. He even made up for his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him at all times to help in the event of an emergency.
When Honza was 15, the parents decided to try to change doctors and contact the experts at the FN in Motol. After a series of examinations, doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the lesion from his brain - a source of epileptic seizures. "I had to do two surgeries in a row, first the doctors injected probes into my brain that scanned his activities, then they could remove my deposit. It was a weeks-long hell for me. I just had to lie down and barely move, wires that were connected to the computer jutted out of my head," Honza recalls.
The surgery was successful and the doctors removed the rather extensive deposit. "The first days after the surgery were very mentally challenging, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and barely talking. In contrast, how he is normally alive and communicative, it was a frightening change, but fortunately, after a few days, everything returned to normal," the mother describes, adding: "The month and a half after the surgery had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors it happens. It's been a seizure for three months since then."
This year's school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, he enjoys languages and has started working with the E Society, with which he travels to the schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza is not fully engaged in sports activities yet, he is starting to return to the sport slowly. "I'm learning how to play the sport right, how to breathe well so as not to expose the body to sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, she will not actively attend the traditional EPPI of the boating triathlon, on which the sick meet epilepsy and healthy athletes, which takes place this weekend on September 28, 2019 at the Cheerful Sandpit. But perhaps next year, I do.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kik, the authority has authorized. But there's a catch
"The Office for the Protection of Competition authorised, subject to the fulfilment of the structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition for the merger of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Nábytek and Lambda Properties Czechia on the other," said the spokesman for the ÚOHS, Martin Švanda.
XLCEE- Holding owns the Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If the Kika chain were absorbed, it would occupy too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. They must therefore sell off part of the purchased company.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, the transaction must be authorised by the antitrust authorities. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kiku last year for a symbolic award.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it had been owned by the Italian company Steinhoff International Holdings, a South African company. She faced problems when she revealed discrepancies in her accounting. Kika has nine outlets in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been active in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Asko-Furniture, and Kika are among the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner has the Möbelix brand. After taking over Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about $114 billion).
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with a manuscript exhibition
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and on Saturday by people in Klementinum, Prague. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the rare originals in the display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free of charge, it is open both days from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The exhibition of documents called Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and the Václav IV Library, the library was prepared together with the National Archives. The written heritage from the reign of Václav IV is viewed by the National Archives from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, the author Jan Vojtíšek said of the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on the agriculture of Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically an encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, a prayer book by one of the Benedictines of the Monastery. Jiří at Prague Castle, from the early 15th century," he said, listing the reasons why he thought people should look at the exhibition.
The Epistles of Peter of Blois, where the semiaca of King Henry II of England is depicted in the opening miniature H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Bible, was also involved in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin anthologé of John Wycliff's tractualism from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book has been preserved from the Václav IV library on Czech territory. This library, according to experts, was one of the most extensive and most beautiful book collections in what was then Central Europe, because the young king wanted to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library was extinguished soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed in the conquest of the castle of the Hussites. But several codes have been saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the digital library Manuscriptorium," said the director of the National Library, Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition called What Plains Below is Streets will also be open in Klementinum, which presents the archaeological discoveries here.
Kristýna Plíšková failed to reach the final, her second title is missing so far
Plíšková's environment in Tashkent was testimoured, she won her first tournament on the WTA circuit in 2016 and was very sovereign this year as well.
After wins with Paolini, Kawa and Kužmová, she made it to the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Christine. The Belgian kept her serve and double-crossed Plíšková's serve in the first set. Then, in the second set, Van Uytvanck went ahead 3-0 at the start of a 3-0 lead and Christine's turnaround failed, even though she eventually managed to convert one break point. In the last she averted one match point, but the other came the end.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! In the bright hair she rejuvenated
Film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she celebrates her jubilee of her life in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she helped. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who wore her hair in gray color, wore sedate things and set off sporadically to the company. She's always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can unwind in the look of her image.
Luckily, she didn't follow the plastic surgery trend and takes care of her skin with good old-fashioned indulons. And her anti-wrinkle recipe pays off. But now she'd changed her hair color and completely saw through it.
When she came to a social event where the celebrities said goodbye to the summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did she have lighter and shorter hair, but she was still dressed in a yellow jacket that brightened her even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate that even on the cusp of the seventies, they can take their looks at the halt. And it paid off for Peter, it looks to be 50 at the most.
Traveller Sigismund or General Boček. Senate handles commemorative medals
Boček, 9a, who was a fighter for the British Air Force during World War II, thanked all the awards for the medals awarded. "The Senate was one of the first to remember and do not forget war veterans," he said, among other things. "The awards I received today also belong to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
Kubera warned against dividing society in his speech. "Let's not forget about our roots, which all of us, whether or not we don't want, unite and shape us. After all, it is from these values that our successful present comes from," said Kubera.
The awards were cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, the long-time rector of Tomáš Bata Bata University in Zlín, Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveller and populariser of science Václav Cílek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Union and Vice President of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěk. The upper house praised his heroism - he saved the life of his neighbor and his two-year-old granddaughter in January this year when he pulled them out of a burning car. The medals were also given to the former chairmen of the upper house Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch.
Sigismund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, made a series of travel expeditions around the world, in which they gathered a number of documentary material. Fištejn was a commentator and director of Radio Free Europe's broadcasting, now he is working with the public media. Steigerwald also serves as a playwright and screenwriter, musician Kocáb being the head of the parliamentary commission for the oversight of the expulsion of Soviet troops.
The medal was given in advance by the astronomer and emeritus head of the United Nations Office for Space Affairs, Luboš Perek, on the occasion of his hundredth birthday in July. By the end of the year, the same awards are to be awarded to the Czech native and the first US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called Underground Underground University during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
