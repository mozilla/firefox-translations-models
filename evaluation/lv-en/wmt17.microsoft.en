28-year-old cook found dead at San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a supermarket .
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone wanting to hurt his brother, pointing out that: "His life finally started to improve."
The body, which was found near a Westfield supermarket on Wednesday, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Sciences said.
San Francisco police said his death was found to be a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, tells San Francisco broadcaster ABC KGO that Frank previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he got to his dream job at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a cohesive family and we will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
During this difficult time, we are with Frank's friends and family in our thoughts.
Luis Galicia says that at first Frank had stayed overnight in hostels, but lately life had finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Lewis tells radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia says he doesn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by making a delicious meal and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in disputes.
He was that brother who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that glowed brightly every day," he says.
Anyone with information about what happened is invited to call the SFPD Information Hotline at 415-575-4444.
Young doctors' strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of young doctors are demanding that their union start protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association's (LMA) Young Doctors' Committee (JAK) is set to ask the council to support broader protests in early September.
According to the JAK, ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the treaty.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JAK councillor Ellen McCort said the government continues to remain silent on the issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, as a result of the JAK vote, the contract proposal has been completely rejected and the decision has been taken to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA council to authorize the drafting of new treaties that would take effect in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors have taken part in six strikes, including cutting off work for the first time in NHS history.
After a vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johan Malawana, a representative of the young doctors of the LMA, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that a contract would be signed with English medics.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of the Marginalized?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But Vladimir Putin's greeting of the Turkish leader in St. Petersburg's palace gave the impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
However, the two shook hands.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked artificial and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual restraint.
In contrast, Reed Tayyip Erdogan at least five times called Putin his "dear friend," according to a review of the meeting.
I was upset by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm arouses conflicting feelings.
But the radiant coolness from Putin suggests that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the downing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
It was then that Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a dagger in Moscow's back.
The abuse was even more painful, given that it came from a friend's side.
Restoring true confidence will be very difficult, if not impossible.
Since November, however, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations that Erdogan's own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied this.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it's time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia might see this as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from peace reconciliation is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was attempted to overthrow.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused severe damage, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually provide an influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe a sigh of relief when scheduled flights are restored.
They are hoping for a vacation fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, state TV is predicting a fall in fruit and vegetable prices due to the resumption of Turkish fruit and vegetable imports.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "Tourists to them, tomatoes to us."
But the visit also had other political motives from the Moscow side.
Ankara is angry with the West for what they consider to be a weak response to the coup attempt.
Dissatisfaction with the protracted negotiations on EU accession and the intervention of Putin, who is happy to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has become estranged from the West, can also be seen in everything.
The Russian leader undoubtedly scored extra points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it itself has a deep-rooted fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, an "outcast alliance", two countries that feel excluded from the West are joining forces.
But despite the unity publicly demonstrated, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, unwilling to divulge information, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish president purposefully avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of openly hostile relations and a potential catastrophe when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SKB brand will continue to play a supporting role, the bank's CEO has announced.
Outside Scotland, the SKB will no longer be available.
Ross McEwan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because, eight years ago, the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts in branding strategy have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided to bring other national brands to the fore.
Royal Scottish Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and official stock exchange list, will be changed to NatWest.
In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the brand name The Ulster Bank is already in use.
Smaller private finance brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also now gain prominence.
McEwan was interviewed during a field trip with customers and employees through Inverneshire.
He told the BBC's Scotland channel: "SKB will become the brand of our investors and that our employees work with because now we are becoming more of a brand bank."
With time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"It's the right time to become a brand bank because we've long asked ourselves the question of how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs rather than our own needs, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the time.
Frankie Detori wins his 3000th victory, taking first place in NewMarket with the horse Predilection
Detori uncorks the champagne, earning his 3000th victory twice finishing first in a race at Newmarket.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Detori earned his 3000th victory in British history, earning first place at Newmarket.
He achieved this by earning his second victory in this race , held in his hometown, riding with the Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved such a result in horse sprint racing.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Ederia and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won with horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and chanting.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in hurdles racing - champion Richard Johnson and career-ending 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who set several records in his career, winning more than 4300.
Lester Pigot, a nine-time derby winner, has won 4493 in his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys and it's no surprise that he's achieved success that few are able to achieve.
He's stylish and strong, but his sense of tactics sets him apart from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attract fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, at the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he would have already won 6000 if he hadn't only participated in weekend and big races.
But seriously, it's a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning UK racing for 30 years.
He's cheerful, which is great for British racing, plus he's a brilliant jockey.
Frank Detori celebrated this achievement with his trademark - the flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventurous journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seventh" in Ascott, and survived a plane crash and disqualification for taking preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after a six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by challenging those who questioned him, returning to his best form.
And he could participate in the race for some time yet - Detori has previously said he would love to continue participating in the race until at least the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses administration chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the circle of people closest to Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old politician has now been appointed special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin's statement said Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the job duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration", without giving a reason.
In place of Ivanov, Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was appointed to the post.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a terrified diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI), and later worked at the Tokyo embassy.
According to the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he later headed the Presidential Protocol and the administration of government employees.
After his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main job of the administration is to support your work as President of Latvia by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave office and recommended Blame as his replacement.
Are smiles convincing?
The move has embarrassed Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked for the Soviet security service in the KGB.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a meeting broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the camera-focused smiles, few are persuaded by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the struggle for power?
No one knows that.
But the official claim that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy himself, is perceived with great skepticism.
In notes published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, one might even say, problematic position, for four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He has previously served as prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the KGB's State Security Service, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, Ivanov held the post of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusts the most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, since re-election of Putin to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But it was then that another close ally of Putin became president - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the post of president.
The enigmatic appearance of fish in some garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the conditions of what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banf.
Kevin Bein thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels that have been cancelled with a watershed .
Mr. Bein, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, released a fish video on the website Periscope, hoping someone might know how these 5-centimeter-large fish ended up in his garden.
Queensfery Junction: The bridge is now connected to Faif.
The £1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of Queensfery Junction and the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The structure of the Faif Bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The £1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensfery Bridge."
In this project, we see an unsurpassed engineering solution, where more than 30, 000 tons of cement and steel were used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires tremendous accuracy.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the final section connecting the bridge with Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says, "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end civil engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the support of the north tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road with the ground part, or viaduct.
This was done by sliding the viaduct part of the northern driveway 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled obliquely by about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions that the team worked with was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything worked out fine.
Simone Bails wins gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Bails isn't bothered by all of this.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortlessly performs exercises on the log.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Perfectly flawless.
And finally the Olympic champion, too.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won the gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62.198 was head-to-head superior to that of silver medallist and her teammate Aliya Raisman and bronze medallist Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simone Bails performed an exercise on the beam in the individual multi-fight final of athletic gymnastics for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailsa became the fourth American in a row to win the title of multi-fight champion and the fifth-best gymnast, gradually cementing her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and probably the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears as the long road to the moment was over.
This achievement puts him next to such unsurpassed athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Bails has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such brilliant, accurate and ambitious exercise combinations that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Reton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
In Brazil, she was met with the final ordeal, where she had to compete heavily with the expectations placed on her rather than with the other female athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simone Bails (left) and Allie Raisman are hugging after winning gold and silver medals respectively in the women's 2016 Summer Olympics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailsa won her first gold medal on Tuesday, making a special farewell party for team coordinator Martha Carolji.
Although Bailsa claims she hadn't expected anything like this in her long journey to the peaks of fame, it's not true.
Part of her performance in free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the arena of the Rio Olympics.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still an infant and discovered by coach Amy Bourman's mother on a field trip to the gym where Bourman's terns were held, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn't lost in a multi-fight race since the summer of 2013 and the winning streak can continue for as long as Bailsa wants it.
Although Mustafina took the lead somewhat during the two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The balance log and free movement - the part of the competition where Bailsa will defend her title as champion is yet to come.
She took the lead with a score of 15,433 on the log and consolidated the lead with a score of 15,933 in free movement
Raisman hugged her gently while they waited for the results, which was just a formality and she burst into tears of joy as the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raisman's result was like a bit of revenge for four-year-old events when she shared third place with Mustafina, yet lost her fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom Americans call "grandma," took a convincing lead.
After performing in free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to devote herself to the crowd of air kisses.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old Bails' viral Twitter post r, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahay Brown "bullet-smashed" survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot dead in Philadelphia, saying it was already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS's Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells television, "His little body was just bullet-shattered."
I can't believe it.
The boy has been admitted to hospital in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start going first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in a part of the city of Jermantun.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the condition of the other two victims is stable.
The channel says the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of them were the attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that it was likely that several shooters were involved in the shooting.
Shells of gun cartridges belonging to various weapons were found at the scene.
It looks like it's been a long-running shooting.
Shells were found on both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were a number of armed shooters here who took an active part in the shooting," says Philadelphia Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
Several homes and cars were also damaged.
No one has yet been arrested and police are reportedly probing surveillance camera recordings.
On Tuesday, a stray bullet hit a 6-year-old girl in the arm while she was playing in front of her home in the West Oakley area.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simona, Gaby and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athletics Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team includes three female athletes, Simone Bails, Gaby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many girls of young descent.
People can be proud that this team also includes Aliya Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Cozian, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast has been an American of African descent.
Last year, Simone and Gaby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympics, Gaby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by triple world champion Simone Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win a gold medal in the women's individual multi-event.
Her teammate Aliya Raisman won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but in the rest of the country the situation in gymnastics lessons is completely different.
Simone, Gaby and Laurie entered the Olympic team just as did Allie and Madison.
They're the "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is coach Martha Carol's final year as a coach.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts mainly train in private athletics clubs and are maintained by parents who pay for workouts, facilities, travel, uniforms, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in areas of cities that can afford the sport.
In these clubs, athletes conduct all their training, and this is an expensive and long investment for athletics families.
Amy Boerman - Simone Bails coach and Maggie Haney - Laurie Hernandez coach has been coaching her athletes since both girls started doing athletics.
We need to provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gaby and Laurie with cheaper gymnastics training options.
I founded my own athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is based in Haarlem and we offer over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Spanish) gymnastics training for free or at a low price. We have also coached national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and striving for a goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it's fantastic.
Practicing this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Allie, Gaby and Madison for the great demonstration of "The Power of Girls", winning gold medals at the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer is rejected, the new doctors plan to roll out more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the controversy by reaching an agreement to change the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association. But it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to sign a contract, saying the NHS was in a precarious state and further delays would only hurt staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in the conditions for working night shifts and weekends in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, BMA's spokeswoman for young doctors, Dr. Ellen McUult, said young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labor crisis and it does not put all doctors on an equal footing.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of young doctors sign the new contract, so progress needs to be made, because there is not much time left.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiation have been met with the government's unwillingness to get involved and sometimes with complete silence.
This is despite the fact that just last month, Jeremy Hunt said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action , stop inaction and cooperate with young doctors.
If he does not do this, then the young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike in late April, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone picketing.
Ministers hoped to end the controversy by reaching an agreement to change the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate for working weekends for the 54,000 young doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS employment chief executive Daniel Mortimer urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes solve nothing but only increase the pressure on strained workers and worry, create stress and disincentives for patients, caregivers and their families.
For the past two months, we have spoken to the new medical committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about trustees and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as employee placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, dropouts and gender pay inequalities in medicine - show that employers, England's health authorities and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements reached with BME in November, February and May.
The drug by 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend taking it to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This drug is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a recurrent heart attack.
NICE, represented by the NHS, recommends taking this product 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NINE, currently under the responsibility of the NHS, recommends the use of this product 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Every year, around 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack and a quarter of them experience a repeat heart attack or stroke.
A heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the blockage ruptures, it can produce a thrombus, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the clot detaches from the wall of blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block the access of blood to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of recurrent heart attacks.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years of 60 mg twice a day with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, director of health technology at NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of medications to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences."
Fear of a repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have already experienced it.
By provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options for thousands of people, which is thus the winner.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when using this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness encourages electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to a management report, former Tauerhamlet Mayor Lutfur Rahman was fired from his post due to corruption.
The government's report reveals that a culture of political correctness turns a blind eye to large-scale cheating in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pikl criticizes police, election watchdogs and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the election process because they are "afraid of offending ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organization, says voter intimidation for religious reasons is so common that police should be allowed to deploy guards near polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present an ID when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only need to provide their name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of voted voters with special ink to prevent double voting.
Whistleblowers also need to be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have greater access to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the scandal surrounding the Tauerhamlet city election.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove Mayor Lutfur Rahman from his post as mayor due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious outlook of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the position that it is the religious duty of believing Muslims to vote for him."
About 300 votes were fake or questionable because one person had voted multiple times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that the fraud in mail-in voting, where senior members of the Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their preferred candidates, is particularly worrying.
Sir Eric suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to establish a person's identity.
His report reads: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for candidates chosen by community elders, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There are concerns that county authorities are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness because of the potential to offend ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists from handling mail-in ballots to prevent "vote collection."
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent voter rolls from being used for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider requiring voters to present an ID before voting.
Mark the fingers of voted voters with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the nationality of persons to ensure that a person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Ban political campaigners and activists from working with votes cast by mail and ballot envelopes for mail-in voting.
Provide the police with the power to order security guards at polling stations.
Make changes to the law to make it easier for individuals to be held accountable for intimidation under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Ban photography at polling stations.
Require only English to be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Step up training to ensure that voters go to the ballot box one by one.
Sir Eric sharply criticizes the Metropolitan Police, expressing puzzlement that no charges have been filed in the Tauerhamlet case .
He says: "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was conclusively found guilty by the standard of criminal evidence based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "tick-check" of city council voters at voter registration precincts.
Sir Eric states: "Last year's court decision is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the alarming and covert spread of election fraud and the authorities' pretence of fraud threatens this good reputation.

The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer allegedly 'died like a pig'.
Byron McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanha's finish in fourth place in the 4x200m freestyle relay for women, sparked a storm of outrage in CBC viewers.
Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators commented that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "flown out of the race that she only smelled" and "died like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when the women's 4x200m freestyle relay set out his personal opinion at the conclusion of the finale .
McDonald, who was included in the CBC's panel of commentators to give the comments liveliness, said, "That little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep up."
"Too run, she flew out of the race that she only smelled and died like a pig."
Thank you very much!
14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana's score in the second stage was 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rucka's, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted on the Internet, as they were shocked to hear such a tone and expressions.
Emmett McFarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did a direct CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'ended up like a pig'????".
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the live air.
Ai Yanha from China in the 4x200m freestyle final for women was named "the little fourteen-year-old from China who does not keep up."
Criticism of Byron McDonald quickly took hold, as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users couldn't believe it when they heard Byron McDonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote, "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and because of you, we all sound like racists. #pretīgi.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who was directing the CBC livestream at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying, "We apologize that the comment about the swimming result went live on the air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded on Twitter to the comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
The CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and that they went live on the air.
Yesterday, we immediately reacted and apologized to all live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that Byron's comments were made about the swimmer's performance, and not addressed to her personally.
But these were unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements in any case, and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized on the live air and tried to explain that he didn't think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
At the CBC Olympics livestream, he said: "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not about her personally.
Needless to say, I hadn't meant to show disrespect and I'm really sorry that it happened.
Primark shoppers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly tries on underwear in the middle of a store.
Shoppers felt uncomfortable when a woman began to undress to try on panties in the middle of the store.
Making things worse, she tried them on to make sure they suited her and then pulled them off, putting her panties back on the store shelf.
She continued to look for clothes at the Bouverie Place mall store in Folkeston and tried on four more panties.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston – the place where this woman put on her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children, was also in the store at the time, who says the unfamiliar woman put on her clothes after fitting her underwear and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people couldn't believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underpants off the shelf, took off her tights and pants, and measured them right there on the spot.
She wasn't even trying to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just tried them right there on the spot.
Everyone watched her take off her panties and apparently the woman didn't like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She measured up three more panties until she decided she didn't like any of them and left the store.
It didn't look like she was worried that someone was watching or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she was trying on.
Miss Davidson, 33, from Kent, says, "The idea is that someone will buy clothes that have been tried on by another person and have not been washed afterwards."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson adds, "I'm assuming the store staff took those clothes out of the store shelves after she left - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying new underwear and finding out that another woman has tried them on and then they haven't been washed.
A Primark spokesman said Primark was aware of the incident, which happened on Tuesday, August 9.
The clothes in question have been removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To figure out how to protect ourselves at a close distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga's grandmaster from New York, Ron Mizraki.
Whether you're being attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and prevail over the attacker.
Mizraki points out that if an attacker attacks from the back, then you must first turn around to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then you need to grab the weapon between your front arm and shoulder and make a blow to the opponent's face with your free elbow.
Then follows a blow with his knee through the groin and while the attacker freezes in pain, you need to take away his weapon, hit him in the face with the gun clip and retreat, continuing to point the weapon at him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - you need to avoid the trajectory of the shot, grab the weapon and fold it so that the villain cannot fire.
At the same time, you need to put pressure on the weapon and strike the opponent on the chest and finally deprive him of the weapon and retreat while continuing to aim at him.
Sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you are not a master of Krav Maga, then it is safer to return your money to the robber.
The Vandal family vandals the Saltash Cornwall social house and is evicted on the street.
The Vandal family has been evicted from their residence for terrorizing neighbors by causing £50,000 in damage to a social home.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were evicted from their property in Saltash Cornwall because of a number of complaints filed against them.
When they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property had been completely vandalized.
Holes had been knocked out in the floors and walls, garbage had been tossed everywhere and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now been evicted from the property and is likely to live on some private property.
Donna McEwoy, manager of the Cornish Housing Service, says there are concerns that the home will not be able to be renovated.
She says it's been extremely difficult for the people who lived here and she believes people can't live that way.
In this case, a number of factors need to be considered, since in the future this property will not have a good reputation in Cornwall.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who have periodically stayed on the property and police say their terror took the form of violence, sneaking out on the street with baseball bats, intimidating local residents, using drugs, selling drugs and loud scolding and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, whose name was the property, was sentenced in June for antisocial behaviour.
In several rooms of the vandalized house, tossed garbage was found.
In a house where drugs may have been previously sold, several floorboards have also been pulled out.
Neighbors say they regularly climbed the street and constantly called the police.
They were evicted from the property forcibly by the Cornish Housing Service after being given 11 weeks to remove from the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about the eviction, because their life had been absolute hell.
One said: "They didn't care about other residents ."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
It's unbelievable how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is head of neighbourhood protection at the Cornwall Housing Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police are regularly called here.
In the overgrown garden of the house, various old and unusable items were found.
He also said: "It is very unfortunate that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour as evictions are always the last step considered by the Cornish Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and their neighbours had to watch their behaviour very hard.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall police and commune members who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information, have put into this matter.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbors and show that antisocial behavior is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived here in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after being evicted.
Service workers will now have to clean up the pile of garbage left in the house.
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of possessing Class B drugs with the intent to distribute them.
She insisted the money was for a monument to her son, Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it became known that they were currently renting some private property in Plymouth.
Graffiti was drawn on many of the walls of the house.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their leases.
Devon and Cornwall police spokeswoman Angela Crowe says the eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said that: "This is a warning to those who believe they can behave as they please and it will have no consequences."
Criminal and antisocial behaviour is unacceptable to Devon and Kronwall police and police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort town of Cannes has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the beaches of that city, which almost completely obscure the woman's body and closely resemble a wetsuit, local officials said Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"A beach gown that ostentatiously demonstrates religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may pose a risk of public order disturbances (crowding, clashes, etc.) that need to be prevented," the order said.
"We are talking not about a ban on the wearing of religious symbols on the beach, but about ostentatious clothing associated with loyalty to terrorist movements that are at war with us," explained Thierry Migul, the head of municipal utilities.
He added that burkini swimsuits have not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since July 28, when Linar, a member of the centre-right republican party, signed the order and it went into effect.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille canceled a planned private event for Muslim women dressed in burkini swimsuits, as outrage over such an event was expressed by politicians from both right and left circles.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face covering the headgear of Muslim women, but religious symbols or relevant clothing are not prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the resort town of Nice, close to Cannes, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State brutally murdered a priest in a church in northwestern France.
"Jysk" grew its turnover by 5% last year
Sia "Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" ("Jysk"), a retailer of household goods, grew its turnover by 5% last year, reaching 23.66 million euros, according to information from "Firmas.lv".
The company's turnover in 2014 was 22.57 million euros.
The company's profit also increased slightly - from 781 235 euros in 2014 to 785 896 euros last year.
The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, on Slokas Street, and closed the store in Riga, on Kurzemes prospekts.
Also this year, as in other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
Meanwhile, last year's profits are recommended to be left undistributed.
"Jysk" is an international network of stores that offer goods for home improvement.
Jysk Linnen'n Furniture Ltd. was founded in 2001.
The share capital of the company is 3 500 264 euros.
The company is owned by the Icelandic company "Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC".

In Lucavsala, the festival "Kubana" has begun.
On the evening of Thursday, August 11, one of the last festivals of this summer was given a start in Lucavsala - "Kuban" will be held there until Sunday night.
On the first evening, the gathered were pampered by such groups as "Enter Shikari" from the UK, which was expected last year, but disappeared unnoticed from the program, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival, the program contains noteworthy names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", drummer of punk rock legend "Ramones" Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergei Mikhalok at the forefront, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full program of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" is taking place in Latvia.
Last year, it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but this did not stop the organizers from rehearsing - they added a length mark to the name, also included a Latvian group in the program (on Friday evening at 19:15 "All Day Long" will take the stage) and announced that now the festival has become "closer and has acquired local color alongside such symbols of Riga as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified is still too early to judge, since the festival has only kicked off, but as "Delphi Entertainment" observed on the first evening, at least for the time being, huge crowds of people have not been attracted and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British track cycling team twice corrects the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
Britain's track team broke the Olympic record twice on Thursday and won the men's sprint race.
The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in qualifying, but in the first round of the competition it was re-corrected by the New Zealanders.
In the sprint final, the British team met New Zealand, and the British stripped the New Zealanders of the title of Olympic record holders, leaving them with silver medals.
In the final, the British team won by a score of 42.440 seconds, beating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for bronze, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification for the women's pursuit drive - the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The president who remained in the shadows: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
Friday, August 12, marks the 145th anniversary of the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the State of Latvia, but undeservedly remained in the shadow of the widely described first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last President of the pre-war period Kārlis Ulmanis.
No one else of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, writes Arnolds Auziņš in a book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgals, published ten years ago.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi", Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-ranking politicians who has had a sense of humor.
The rest such stiff, always very correct.
He couldn't be, nowadays it could be similar to what Raimonds Vējonis is.
"He was someone who was close to the people," Austen says.
Modern politicians know history poorly, they referred to Karl Ullmann as the good leader, but rarely does anyone know how abominable he was.
At government meetings, the only person he hasn't yelled at was General Dove.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democracy, leaves exactly the opposite impression", says Auziņš.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with "Delphi", agrees with Auziņa's assessment of Zemgale as a calm and balanced statesman.
He also notes that Zemgals distinguished himself with respect for minorities, regularly inviting Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time it was not a common practice, after the presidency of Zemgals, Albert Kviesis took over this tradition", says the historian.
He was such a quiet and measured man who had to be persuaded to become president for a long time.
He himself did not strive for it, just did not crave fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but believed that the president must have been able to do so.
"During the presidency, the basics of French were learned," explains Strang.
Zemgals did not allow himself to be persuaded to run again, he did not really like it at all.
In every way, he is a very respected personality in the history of Latvia, even before he got to the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Zemgals also headed the famous Zemgala treasury at Suvorova Street 3, where the Society of Savings Makers and Loan Lenders was located, where practically the Latvian state was created in government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
He was not a big fan of Ulmanis, but in public he also did not object.
"In private conversations, though, he has sometimes said that it's not really Ulman's actions that he is sympathetic to," says Strang.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How is Zemgala remembered today?
It is a pity, but for a large part he associates himself only with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were centrist.
"There weren't any major upheavals in his time, which is that he could be associated with such a truly stable presidency," Strang sums up.
During the presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's state visit to Sweden also took place, which at that time implied full recognition of Latvia in the neighboring country and integration into the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals came on a state visit to Stockholm.
The reply visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on June 29, 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with anger attacks.
I often have to deal with the fact that the appearance of anger, rage in a child is considered by parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, psychologist Ekaterina Kess points out in "Econet".
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these such natural and human feelings - the anger and rage that everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression - this is already a physical act addressed to another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, upset - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and rage in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can kick the couch in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, hit a kulak around the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not direct our aggression towards others because we know different other ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they experience anger, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name it and how to live with it.
They can say: "Go away!", You are a fool", "Bad mom", "I don't see you", "I will not be friends with you" - and very rarely when they are able to say: "I am angry with you".
Children live in the literal sense, they are completely right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and sincere in the expression of their feelings, and often also find themselves captive to various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, do not be ashamed of it and do not show up, but, on the contrary, help the child.
Do you need a pause in a relationship?
A long working day in which everything has not quite gone as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "disconnect" from the whole world for a while, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a while and breathe a little?
Or does it show that each of the partners has its own way to go?
His opinions are shared by gentlemen of different ages.
John (23) is short and concise: "In my opinion, if you need a break in a relationship, then you are not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that can possibly help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get on your nerves for every little thing, then definitely - this is the right moment when you should look at other hunting fields to understand if you miss him, whether you especially think about him or do not even want to see him again.
So the answer is - yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Kaspar (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, it is necessary to take a break from each other in the relationship on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then quarrels are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every little thing that the other is doing and it begins to fall on your nerves.
People start to bother each other, especially when there's not even anything else to talk about, just what you've done through the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven't endured a relationship for more than a couple of months either.
If you think for a moment about the fact that elsewhere or with another is better - then why does this woman you are with deserve one who can think about the fact that it is not good enough and there are fields of paradise behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is already a little betrayal.
If not, then there is none.
"I have, so I condemn those who don't a little bit." says Edmund (46).
Charles (33) has an almost completely opposite opinion.
I feel like everyone needs a moment of respite.
You can't look each other in the eye every moment, all the time, from morning to night, and rejoice in enduring love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, also for a girlfriend or wife, however, if both know how to keep that balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live to the very edge of the grave.
So and only so.
Martin (27) says this: "It's hard to say whether you need it or not, may or may not take that break, but one thing is clear - its initiator doesn't have something in the relationship to the end, something that's missing."
If this question comes up, then one should expect that in the near future there will be some changes - for the better or for the worse, it depends on themselves.
I mean, while you're still young and crazy, you need to pause in the meantime - all the time, but when everything gets serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there can be no talk of rest.
You do decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't stand each other's company right now and need respite once in a while, then what will it be like when you're retirees commenting on how passing cats sneer or argue about what day the garden should be better razed," explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozentāls was the first to awaken in the Latvian people an interest in fine arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable," romans Suta once wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when opening the old master's extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition opened on August 12, but already from August 13 it is open to visitors and will be on display until October 30.
The Latvian National Museum of Art pays tribute to the painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916) with an extensive retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall, whose one hundred and fiftieth birthday is included in the UNESCO calendar of celebrated days internationally.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the Janis Rozentals anniversary year program.
The selection of artworks is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic's creative activity, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
At the turn of the century, the atmosphere is enlivened by the presence of photos, the exhibition's mobile application reveals the convocations of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter with his own camera for creative purposes.
Meanwhile, the Finnish-Latvian friendship society "Rozentāls-seura", named after the Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art simultaneously offers the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition "With a Gaze in Finland, with a Heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with an outline of content in English, Finnish and Swedish will open in the autumn at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki.
Matt LeBlanc is looking forward to returning to the "TopGear" show.
Matt Leblanc, the host of the television show "TopGear" ("Gas in the Floor!"), has said he is looking forward to returning to the second season of the car show, but admitted he doesn't know what awaits him in the future.
So far, nothing officially happens.
"If there is, it will be announced by the BBC," LeBlanc revealed in a conversation with television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas in the Floor!" arose in July, when Leblanc's companion, Chris Evans, announced he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and "Gas in the Floor!" were "made for each other."
Evans describes the former star of the series "Friends" ("Friends") as a "real and good man", thereby dispelling rumors that the friendship of the two broke up during the filming.
When LeBlank was asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
Telechannel BBC reports that there are no plans to replace Evans in the show's new 24th season for the time being.
Calvin: Meldonium could be removed from the list of banned substances for athletes as early as this year.
It is expected that meldonium, which is part of the Latvian drug Mildronate, could be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, academician Ivars Kalviņš, said in a broadcast on LNT for 900 seconds on Friday morning.
He said he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the meldonium issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Mildronate would be removed from the "blacklist" as early as this year.

Behind the scenes of the U.S. model business, in his interpretation, the gloss of a perversely sophisticated photo shoot and the intolerability of a horror film.
In essence - a very provocative work, balancing on sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the boundaries between the territory of a European art house film and the Hollywood genre product are difficult to draw.
The film, starring Vigo Mortensen, highlights the question of whether parents' conceptually chosen life patterns (ecologicality, vegetarianism, alternativeism, and distancing themselves from the gluttony and values of consumerism) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.
The father of six children, the idealist after the death of his wife is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and real values.
A touching, life-long film written by Matt Ross won the Cannes Festival Award for directing this year..
Of course, sharks do just that as attacking fair girls - In the jaws, it was a swimmer, in this case, a brave surfer, played by Blake Boatley.
The work required profound heroism from her.
This survival solo can be compared to James Franco's acting showcase in 127 Hours and Ryan Reynolds' play in The Buried Alive.
Mila Kunis, the protagonist of the main role, may also be to blame, whose transformation from a role model mother into a creative settler and a ridicule of almost familial values seems to have been created solely by the fantasy of quite desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2000 civilians in Syria.
Militants from the terrorist group Islamic State have taken captive about 2000 civilians used as human shields while fleeing Menbij, Syria's Aleppo province, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers said Friday.
"We did not shoot at them because they took civilians with them while fleeing to Jerabulus," a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced Friday that Menbij had been liberated from the jihadists.
The Islamic State occupied Menbij in 2014.
The QSD had already driven most Islamic State militants out of Menbij last week, but some held on and showed fierce resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking their captives with them.
Islamists go to Jerabulus, which is located on the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian activist organization Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State kidnapped about 2000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists hijacked the cars of city dwellers, forced people to get into them, and then took them to Jerabulus.
Islamic State militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, while conquering territories in Deir ez Zora province in eastern Syria.
Later, about 270 of the captives were released by the Islamists.
How many Islamic State militants fled Menbij is unknown.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council reported that the QSD had managed to rescue 2500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbij.
Information gathered by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the battle for Menbij.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kolegova refuses to run for the post of head of the SRS.
The head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the agency LETA informed the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has multiplied the controversy between the parties of the ruling coalition.
The real reasons for the discussion seem to be related to the visible, but more often invisible, interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the evaluation of my professional abilities.
"This is also unacceptable to me", emphasizes the now former candidate for the position of SRS manager.
In the event that her candidacy was approved by the government, it would be clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow her to fully work and implement the necessary changes in the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, full-fledged work would be impossible, concludes Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is overly politicised," the official explained.
"Thank you for the trust and support shown to me, it is an experience that I value as a benefit," Kolegova writes in a submission to Reizniece-Ozola.
Unity said Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegova, "significant discrepancies" were revealed between the candidate's explanations and the information available in public registers about the dividend costs of SIA Pallogs, since the publicly available decisions of the Pallogs participants' meetings provide for the non-distribution of profits.
Currently, the duties of the head of the SRS are performed by the Deputy General Director Dace Gray.
In Livani, the police are involved in the rescue of two small children left unattended, according to the Latgale Region Board of the State Police.
The news of unattended strollers with babies was received Friday around 7 p.m.
They were located in Livani near the building of the former store.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the medics for help.
A purse with documents and a mobile phone was also left in the trolley.
In less than half an hour, law enforcement officers found out the possible whereabouts of the children's parents and went there.
Upon arriving at the home of the woman's civil husband, police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was under the influence of strong alcohol.
According to initial information, on the evening of the previous day, a woman born in 1992 visited her girlfriend, where she used alcohol.
Already walking home after sitting together, the woman decided to leave the children near the store under unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphanage court about the incident, which will also decide on the further fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the VK regarding the Krievu Sala project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (SAO) regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development on Krievu Island for the transfer of port activities from the city center, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Freeport of Riga Board.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the insight of the SAO, when preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Freeport of Riga Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte at the Freeport of Riga Authority and the recommendations provided for the improvement of project management in the subsequent stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations today has also been sent to the SAO.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the VK on the expediency of implementing the Krievu Sala project, we take a very responsible approach to the implementation of the project and the provider of financing - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasize that all the construction works planned within the framework of the project are fully completed within the specified deadlines and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, VK and also stevedores, that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the VK regarding project management and monitoring issues", says Sanita Kaire, project manager of Krievu Sala.
For the control and monitoring of the achievement of the project goal, the existing long-term action plan was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the involved parties and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as definitions of the most significant boundary points.
The approved action plan for the achievement of the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, has been supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the deadlines for activities of other parties involved in the project implementation by the Freeport of Riga.
For the improvement of project management and reduction of potential risks, a project management plan has been developed anew, defining the areas of project management and indicating the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a structural diagram of project management has been developed, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of employees.
In order to improve the communication of the Freeport of Riga Authority with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the stakeholders of the project has been developed, which, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders, principles, types and periodicity of information exchange for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve control over the use of financial resources, it will be necessary in future to justify in more detail the necessity of concluding a service contract or launching a procurement, and the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, a port infrastructure that meets world standards has been built on Krievu Island - four new deep-water berths, railway accesses, as well as engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of last year, achieving savings of 10.6 million euros in the planned funding.
The threat has led to increased security at airports in Slovakia.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia on Friday stepped up security measures at several airports, the Interior Ministry said.
"In light of the threat, we have stepped up security measures at the international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," a spokesman for slovakia's Interior Ministry told the AFP news agency on Friday.
"The Center for National Security and Analysis is currently analyzing the information we have received," he added.
On September 16, an informal European Union (EU) summit will be held in the Slovak capital, which will be attended by all countries of the bloc except Great Britain.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of Britain's Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are debating the number of "victims of the Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the death toll at the communist yoke on the former East German border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims remain unsettled.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1841 people who tried to escape from the territory under their control were murdered by communist authorities on the border with western Allied zones and later West Germany.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and adjusts the number of victims from time to time.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned as his family tried to get to West Germany through what was then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also deserters of the Soviet army.
"The final extent of the damage caused by the double evils of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," says Alexandra Hildebrandt, the museum's director.
"Our job is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape from the communist-controlled country are maintained and do not disappear," a statement released by Hildebrandt said.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is inconclusive," says Johen Stath, an expert in East German history at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, along with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that just off the Berlin Wall, 138 people were murdered by communists.
Taking into account those people who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or get to the West through the territory of neighboring countries, according to Stadt, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
But that's significantly less than 1841 anyway.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be the different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors between the ages of 70 and 80 died of a heart attack after shrinking with border controls," that must be a consequence of this 'murderous boundary', according to Hildebrandt.
But Stath is convinced that a distinction needs to be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of the treatment they experienced, and those whose deaths were caused by prolonged waits in hot weather on a bus at the border.
Regardless, accounting for victims is not easy, as communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistics, and researchers have to dig through documents in various scattered archives, according to Stath.
However, Stath's group has recently come across new documents, and so it could come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF president Pone has gone to Rio with coaching accreditation; It's a surprise to yourself.
In recent days, the infamous president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone, has arrived at the Rio Olympics with the accreditation of a coach, but he himself feels surprised by this.
On Wednesday, widespread hype erupted after the statements of Olympic swimmer Alyona Ribakova's coach, German Yakubowski, who revealed that he had decided to go to Rio de Janeiro at the last minute while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially, the list of riders included confirmed swimmers Alyona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as federation president Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation announced five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the departure, Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that German would be there and he was looking for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he was not," Pone said, expressing the opinion that this did not affect Ribakova's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvya's coach undertook to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the LOK's executive committee, sharply criticized the activities of the LOK, shifting the blame to the organization overseeing Olympic sports.
In my view, it is unethical for the LOK Executive Committee to approve five persons and not take one of them.
"I don't know why exactly there wasn't enough room for the Swimming Federation," Pone said of the public's lack of appreciation for the work of the federation and its presidents, recalling that federation presidents don't get salaries.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not confirmed among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone, however, couldn't tell why he's at the Olympics with the accreditation of a coach who most likely should have been due to Jakubowski.
"I had been announced as president of the federation ('team leader'), but for unknown reasons I received coaching accreditation and now I'm not getting anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
Until the last moment, I thought German would be, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the agency LETA, a couple of days before Ribakova's start, she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni and after that the swimmer had tears in her eyes, however, the LPF president himself expressed that it was a mundane conversation with a desire to tune the athlete before the start.
Pone recalled that LPF oversees five sports that are in the Olympic program, and four of them are training for children in Latvia as well.
The president of the federation expressed that drowning issues are also very important in Latvia, and he has also talked about such programs, having been in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup stage could take place in Latvia.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, waste my time and try to implement four-year programs.
600,000 juvenile salmon will be released into the Daugava River.
During the Latvenergo AS fish resource recovery programme, salmon and sea trout juveniles are being released this week in the Daugava river near Mangaļsala, and this year it is planned to release more than 600,000 juvenile annual salmon and sea trout grown in the fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Dole.
Latvenergo agency LETA informed that the introduction of fish will continue for the coming months - every year a total of 6,300,000 juveniles and larvae of various species of fish are allowed into the water bodies of the Daugava basin.
In the spring and beginning of summer 2016, pike and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - whitefish, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zanders and vimbas.
Māris Kuņickis, Latvenergo's production director, said that taking care of the environment is one of the cornerstones of Latvenergo Group's sustainable development.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, each activity is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, carrying out both the rearing and release of juvenile fish into the Daugava basin, as well as implementing other activities," said Kuņickis.
This year, more than 600,000 juvenile annual salmon and sea trout will be allowed into the Daugava estuary.
For the second year, fish fry are marked before being let in by cutting off the buttercup.
The cargo brought today contains 25,000 juvenile salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, in a scientifically based species composition and numerical volume, juvenile fish and larvae are introduced into the Daugava river and its basin water bodies.
Reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River and the water bodies of its basin in accordance with laws and regulations shall be performed by the Bior on the basis of an expert-examination of the losses caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo's economic activity and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures should be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
In turn, the State Environmental Service, on the basis of the abovementioned expert-examination, shall take a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo's annual compensation amount for the fish resource recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We fish", for the fifth year placed 400 artificial fish spawning nests in the Daugava river near Kaibala and Ikšķile.
Cooperation with the association in promoting natural spawning of fish is an additionally supported initiative of Latvenergo within the framework of the fish resource recovery program.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the watershed is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River.
At the festival "Sanssouci Concert Hall" there is a country yard, a forest, a felling site.
Sleep in a tent, eat like in a restaurant, walk in sneakers and listen to exquisite chamber music, enjoying the quiet tranquility of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival Sanssouci, which invites to the Akniste region for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former parish house of Susāja - a village that no longer exists - in adjacent forests and felling sites.
In three days - from August 12 to 14 - on five stages you can combine the carefree exquisite enjoyment of nature and academic music.
This is where theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations come across music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to the smile on your face and lightness on your feet in just a couple of minutes.
"Please do not look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sanssouci can only be captured by spending all three days in it", invites the initiator and host of the festival, opera baritone Armands Siliņš.
The festival's gates open on Friday at 7 p.m. 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be programs on the site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from noon to 10 p.m. 9:00 a.m. until the next dawn.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv",says Armands Siliņš.
The magnificent bouquet of artists includes, for example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartets Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who, together with Latvian musicians Ēriks Kiršfelds, Mārtiņš Zilberts and actress Ancis Strazds, created a contemporary circus performance Confines about the artist's inner struggle.
New works have also been created specifically for the festival.
In the show for children "Insect", composed by Oļesja Kozlovska and Jēkabs Nīmanis according to the motifs of F. Kafka's story Transformation, along with Armands Siliņš, the entomologist (insect researcher) Uģis Piterāns will participate in the musicians and actors.
Oskars Herliņš has composed the first String Quartet, while Anna Ķirse has composed the Tree Opera, a performance whose main characters, directed by Andris Kalnozola, with video projections by Katrīna Neiburga and the scenography of Andris Eglīsis, will be trees in three small clusters in a three-hectare wide clear-cutting.
Singing in the voices of Laima Lediņa, Dinara Rudāne and Sigmar Graš, they will enter into a romantic relationship, just like in the study Tree Wedding (1729) by the Swedish naturalist Karl Linney of the Age of Enlightenment.
The Rio Olympics are launched today by one of the Latvian delegation's biggest hopes, seven-fight athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will start the competition in the 100-meter hurdles race at 15:35 Latvian time, but at 16:50 the competition in the high jump is expected.
Meanwhile, on the night of Saturday at 2.35pm, the bullet push will begin, while at 4.05pm the 200-meter sprint will begin.
The seven-fight race will conclude on Saturday with the long jump, javelin throw and 800-meter run.
Before the Olympics, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won bronze at the world championships last year, was mentioned as a medal contender for the Olympic Games.
Back in May, the Latvian set a new state record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-fight competition in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won ninth place with a repeated Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, the athlete has corrected the state record four times.
Latvian judo wrestler Artūrs Nikiforenko, who competes in the weight category over 100 kilograms, is also scheduled to start today at 16 p.m., having played a fight with Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukauri in the first round.
For a judist, this will be the first Olympics in his career.
The agency LETA has already reported that on Thursday, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms, the Latvian judo wrestler Evgeny Borodavko suffered a loss in his first fight.
He conceded to Japanese Hagu Ryunovski, who later won bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zelonijs brought Latvia an Olympic bronze award, but in the next four Olympic Games, Latvian judists have won only one victory in seven fights, which Borodavko did in London.
At 16:30 Latvian time, Dainis Upelnieks will start the qualifying competition in bench shooting, but the selection will end on Saturday.
Upelnieks received the Olympic road sign only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, however, he later revealed to LETA that he had been quite safe about driving since April.
The athlete has arrived at the Olympic venue as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the shooting range of the competition.
At 19:05 Latvian time, the final three races will be made by the debutant of the Olympic Games 17-year-old Latvian sailor Katija Birzule, who competes in sailing for surfboards in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine runs, Birzule is currently in 25th place among the 26 female athletes.
On Saturday, however, the decisive final race for medals will take place.
Today, the competition in academic rowing is finally scheduled to take place, with Sanita Pushpure, a Latvian representing Ireland, to take part.
On Wednesday, the race was canceled due to inclement weather.
Pushpure will compete in the C/D semifinals for the ladies at 19:10, fighting for 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, she finished fourth in the quarterfinals, from third position, which would allow her to continue her fight for the medal, falling behind by a paltry 0.65 seconds.
Pashpur finished 13th four years ago in London when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be distributed at the Olympics - archery, athletics, track cycling, equestrian, fencing, springboarding, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid says if Clinton is elected president, then she will appoint Garland as a Supreme Court justice .
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid is confident that if she becomes president, then she will nominate Merrick Garland as chief justice of the Supreme Court .
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's confirmation since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose who would replace current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Skalius.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid said he was confident Clinton would choose Garland.
A spokeswoman for the raid later said he had not personally talked to Clinton about the subject and that was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "rock the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "inserts" and act in the best interest of Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said Trump is not fit for the presidency.
Treats announces a nude calendar for women and men.
Treats magazine will collaborate with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar Pirreli in the style of the 70s of the last century.
In its 2017 NU Muse Calendar, it is planned to showcase young supermodels, not naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Steve Shaw, president of Treats magazine, announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine."
This magazine is for women.
It looks like he's talking about the calendar as well.
In a press release about creating the calendar, Shaw says, "We need to go back to depicting enduring and classic nudity in pictures where a woman's body doesn't confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is a great work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person during casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
In the rembat, the buyer, trying out the motorcycle, lets go.
On August 10, at 10 a.m., a "Yamaha YZ250" motorcycle was stolen from the yard of a house in Rembate parish, which has not been registered, according to the State Police.
The owner of the motorcycle, with the help of an advertisement, had wanted to sell the vehicle.
At the agreed time, a potential buyer arrived, climbed on a motorcycle as if to try it and left.
Employees of the Ogre police station of the Riga Regional Administration of the State Police are asking to refer anyone who can provide any information useful for the investigation in connection with the criminal offence that has occurred.
Please call: 65002403 (office hours) or 65002400 (around the clock).

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life of all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says the longevity record belongs to a female that could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters tall.
A French court rejects the request to demolish shops in the "Jungle" refugee camp.
A French court rejected a request by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At a hearing in Calais this week, authorities said the state should demolish 72 self-made boutiques where people in the camp area sell a variety of goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
Calais's prefect's office said these self-created businesses need to be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made boutiques and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the people who set up the 72 self-made boutiques, but it understands Calais's prefect's concerns.
Judge Jean-François Molla said food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food to people living in "extremely sublime conditions."
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the jungle book kids camp café, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French classes, and provides asylum counselling to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect a children's café.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the dissolution of the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities, Aid for Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, reported that the number of residents of the "Jungle" camp had risen to 9000 people, the highest rate since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Great Britain wins silver in the rugby-7 series fight when the Fiji national team masterfully wins gold.
The British national team's impressive performance in the rugby-7 series stage ended on Thursday when, in a thrilling final at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio, the Fiji national team convincingly crushed them by a score of 43-7.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in ball management, ball play with the foot, support game and brute power play, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a respectable consolation award, a silver medal that was Britain's third medal that day. The British national team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough fight in the semi-finals, in which the Bok team suffered a defeat with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably rebounded for Great Britain in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji national team is currently in its best shape to win the 15-man team as well.
Although unlikely, however, a certain consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton won a gold medal. This is the head coach of the Fiji national team Ben Ryan - a former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all their games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The defeat is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji made an impressive start to the match, fending off Britain's power plays for fun.
For captain Tom Mitchell and comrades, it was like racing with several opposing buses and the World Series champions took the lead with 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau scored his first touchdown.
In the final four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also further increased the lead by realizing a groundout on the right wing.
The score was 12-0 and the British team hadn't even really touched the ball.
Mitchell's superb power play prevented the humble Leoni Nakarav from scoring three points, but that only slightly affected Fiji's score.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a grounder in the right corner, cementing the lead over Great Britain to 17-0.
After the rematch, Nakarava further increased the lead and had more than a minute left until the end... the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some clumsy British power techniques and crossed the line, scoring points.
The groundout secured the score at 29-0.
Fiji seemed to have been born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were still learning.
In fact, that is also true.
The British team made a profound change at halftime, breaking the Fiji players' line... a full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team matchup, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score for the British team, making a landing in the left corner and making the score 36-7, but the game was already lost, meanwhile fans of the South Sea Islanders were singing, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
One cannot help but admire Fiji's cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another touchdown at the end of the game.
With the final whistle of the game sounding, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British were able to sit down in the grass after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, in the semifinals, Fiji defeated Japan by a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams scored a touchdown and the South Africans lost by only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown put the Bok team in the lead, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant skill and delivered the ball between the posts, securing the victory for the British.
The excellent power play of Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England rugby-15 team player Anthony, at the end of the game ensured the team a win and another silver medal.
The coach's battle with cancer has inspired Helen Glover and Heather Staning to win the rowing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Heather Staning had a special significance on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two female athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by an echo of Robin Williams, which inspired them to win their second Olympic gold medal in pair rowing for women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such success.
They undoubtedly dominated as they scored an unbeaten, unprecedented victory for the 39th time.
Both great athletes with swan elegance gliding along the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal won in rowing stands a whole team that works hard for athletes to continuously improve their performance and the biggest contribution to their success came from a coach who until 30 months ago did not know if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and that's what happened.
If it were not done, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would get out of hand.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William was able to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 off-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you like.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked distances of 6, 10 and even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it all started.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who had been very anxious all morning and talked more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "It's been an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much me, Helen and Robin have worked.
With Helen and Robin, the past 3 years have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have achieved anything, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better training companion or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning have not lost in any race in five years.
The pair reaches such a tremendous speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, the dominance of Staning and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Not losing concentration is really important.
We got off to a good start, but at the same time we didn't have high expectations.
We had no intention of overthrowing records that day, but just rowing well and winning races and that's what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and television adventurer Steve Baschal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Kolegov will be "promoted to the last" in the position of head of the SRS.
According to him, now it is already "fundamentally important" for Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (Union of Greens and Peasants) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Peasants) to approve kolegova, a candidate promoted by the Minister of Finance, as the head of the SRS.
Rajewski estimated that for both Kuczynski and Reizniece-Ozola in this government, the approval of the head of the SRS is the "first big decision" that may affect their future as politicians.
If now begins to change the position in the choice of a candidate for the position of the head of the SRS, then this will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The agenda of next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of the transfer of the head of the VVD, Kolegova, to the post of director general of the SRS, according to the government's agenda.
Koļegova was promoted to the position of SRS manager by the Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after Ināra Pētersone resigned from the management of the service and when the competition for the position of director general of the SRS ended without result.
Dace Gray, acting head of the SRS, conceded in an interview with Latvijas Radio on Thursday, August 11, that if she was offered to run for the position of manager, then she could agree.
The Minister of Finance, however, later admitted that she was not considering other candidates for the position of SRS head for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, the head of the Saeima faction of the National Association, also admitted that NA still supports Kolegova in the leadership of the SRS.
In Spain, the prospects for reducing the budget deficit are threatened by the inability to form a government.
On 12 July a month ago, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken measures of sufficient magnitude to bring the deficit level down to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
It is estimated that, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP and Spain's deficit was 5.1%.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near term.
One of the reasons why the EC did not, however, introduce sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only add to such a negative sentiment.
Critics, however, point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, first agreeing on uniform rules and then failing to apply them in practice.
Thus, for example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, has pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, giving citizens the impression that the rules of the European Union are recommendatory rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved to extend the deadline for correcting their deficits until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts suggest that Portugal's target could be achieved on time, and that the deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product as early as this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP annually over the next two years.
What makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives is the fact that for eight months now the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the formation of a government, and it is becoming increasingly likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that a third election would not significantly change the political landscape in the country either.
The most popular party remains the people's party led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, which would again win less than 33% of the vote in the election.
Only the Socialists have slightly increased their popularity, while the anti-austerity parties Podemos, or Together We Can, and Ciudadanos, or Citizens, have declined somewhat.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and Ciudadanos involved in government later this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
As Rafael Hernando, a spokesman for the People's Party's parliamentary faction, has stated, if the government is not formed and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a mockery of the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After surveying the beaches for the fifth year, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of garbage found is increasing every year, and most of the visitors to the bathing areas are to blame here.
The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
The capital city council explains that bathing areas are cleaned up every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land during heavy rains can be washed into the water, thus significantly damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement was made this week by volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
After walking along the Gulf of Riga for the fifth year, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by residents has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, that criticality rating has set in.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of garbage on the beach for 100 meters may even exceed 200 units", says Jānis Ulme, a representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Called by Latvian Radio, he was on the beach of Tūja, where the procession of volunteers along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, among the various household waste and remnants of picnics, activists have had to collect even fluorescent lamps left tossed in the sea sand.
Ulme, a participant and organizer of the hike, says it is the residents who are to blame for the pollution.
"The main source is the beachgoers themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the stage of degradation, it is no longer possible to identify them, and mock-ups, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also swimming areas in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrīva, on average, almost 800 units of waste are collected every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
Campaign organisers also explain that there are also mock-ups and warning or prohibition signs not everywhere at every turn.
"Unfortunately, the average figures for all three bathing sites in Riga together - Daugavgriva, Vakarbuļļi and Vecaķi - are large and far exceed the desired or the goal to which Latvia is supposedly moving to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", concludes the environmental defender.
Cleaning of bathing areas in Riga takes place every day, on the hottest days of summer even twice, explains the representative of the city council Uģis Vidauskis.
However, the struggle with dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We come back to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who eat alcohol, smoke and do all the things they can't, even special signs don't work," Vidauski says.
That's why Vidauski is urging bathing visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point out these violations and in this way everyone will fight.
Perhaps some new warnings can be imposed, but as I said, this is unlikely to radically change the situation.
"Because everyone together just has to turn around and be intolerant of such offenders," he stresses.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, however, as in other years, the water quality everywhere is good and satisfactory.
At the moment, the situation is such that in all 56 bathing areas the water quality has been good all the time and there are no restrictions on bathing.
"One last time we will take the tests at the end of August," says Normunds Juniķis, senior environmental health specialist at the inspectorate.
During heavy rainfall, waste left on land can be washed into the water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to an environmentalist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - in the Putin administration, the change of leader.
Left office himself?
Vladimir Putin has told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov wanted to leave the post himself and will henceforth be the president's special representative on nature conservation, ecology and transport.
Announcing the changes, Putin paid tribute to Ivanov in front of the television cameras: "Dear Sergey Borisovich, we have been working together with you for many years and are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you are fulfilling the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well of our agreement not to use you in this position as head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I am sympathetic to your desire to change the scope.
And I hope that in your new position you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Considering that elections to the State Duma are expected in Russia next month, rumors have sounded that this move is connected with the struggle for power among the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible replacement for Putin as president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the post of presidential representative on nature conservation and transport issues has raised doubts.
As the archives of Lsm.lv show, Ivanov is a general colonel of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his career in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, at the end of the reign of the first Russian president Boris Yeltsin, he was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Doctrine of Information Security" developed by Ivanov was approved, which, among other things, in Russia provided for the revival of state censorship mechanisms.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, and already in 2005 - deputy prime minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of enterprises in the Russian defense industry and the export of weapons.
Now, after leaving the post of head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain his seat on the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will now also work.
The blame comes from a family in the elite of the Soviet party.
The post of head of the presidential administration, Vaino, was allegedly recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
Back in the days when we worked in government under your leadership.
And for the past nearly five years, we've been communicating virtually every day.
"Therefore, I am sure that by all professional and personal character traits, he is ready for this job", said Ivanov.
The blame comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including serving as its first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The Internet publication "Meduza", with a reference to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence", writes that in the late 80s Karl Vaino allegedly asked Moscow for permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was refused and soon lost his post.
Shortly after, Vaino has moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and is fluent in Japanese.
However, he has retired from the diplomatic service to work for the Presidential Protocol Administration.
Russia has been reportedly shaken by the suspensions and even arrests of several high-ranking officials in recent weeks, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several counties.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is rearranging the ruling elite ahead of the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features - more and more often representatives of power structures are brought to managerial positions.
Also, judo wrestler Nikiforenko loses in the first fight of the Olympic Games.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo wrestler has finished his participation in the Olympic Games by finishing in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskin admitted to Latvian Television that Nikiforenko's expectations were very few, and this was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the judo wrestler suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is noteworthy that in order to get to the Olympic road sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than is customary - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been said that Yevgeny Borodavko in the fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Ryunosuki held on for two and a half minutes, until the opponent managed a throw worthy of a clean victory.
Consequently, Latvia has concluded the judo competition in Rio.
Dreams disappear into the sands of Rio.
Thursday was preceded by judist Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent in return, but the ambitious ones are able to come as a surprise at times.
He didn't budge.
For Arthur Nikiforenko, the task was even more complicated, since the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectable.
The outcome was similar, although on the tatami he held on for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvian judists have lacked the most ambitions.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial stute Vladimirs Šestakovs passed from the leadership of the federation, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, the "Golden Score" no longer takes place, - the development of judo is moving along a declining curve.
Jackevich, who advises Kazakh judists here, and Vsevold Zelonius do not see heirs.
But if you don't grow up, there won't be either.
And this is the prerogative of the federation.
Therefore, as from another galaxy in the "Morning Panorama" sounded the promise of the president of the Latvian Judo Federation to win medals in Rio.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we eagerly and anxiously awaited the beach volleyball match Samoilov/Šmediņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - for the losers, the games are over.
The Latvian duo, however, had a slight deviation - they could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was further heightened by the protracted previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling swirled over the windy court throughout the match.
For the players, the gusty wind created additional complications.
At first it seemed that it might be an ally of ours - which are more comprehensive.
But did not become.
It was easy enough to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve so to Samoilov and wait for him to burst.
Against Canada cracked, against Cuba broke at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not a joke.
Schmidt was able to fish at the time, because there was little work, but when there was, he did it honorably.
Brazilian Samoilov was able to win two sets with Schmidt as he took the lead with 16:15 left in the first, but also stayed on the 16th, exhausting the lost points limit as well.
But one could also lose with 0:2, as the deficit was -4 in the second set, however, also thanks to the wind, managed to get the victory.
The third was already in the sign of Evandru's serves.
A chain was formed - an unconvincingly taken serve, the second pass often flies too close to the net and Samoilov was left with very few options for a prolific attack.
If there was any foreign Samoilov on the field against the Cubans, then this time he acted more successfully, and it would be unprofessional to take the loss only to Sasha.
Kreilis was also wrong, and it's symbolic enough that it was he who hit the last ball in the block.
The team loses.
This time, luck was definitely lacking as well - in the third set, only two evandru attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball nevertheless hit the line.
Two aisles were next to the line.
The video of the controversial episodes also ruled in favor of opponents.
If in the first two games Evandru was tormented by serves, then against ours they were very productive.
Everything summed up the loss on the scoreboard.
Now it is necessary to calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Maybe it should have been like many to live next to the stadium, rather than with a delegation in the Olympic Village.
Two and a half hours passed on the way.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a series of seven semifinals.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but come here sooner and acclimatize better.
Maybe there was a glitch with finding the pinnacle of athletic form.
For now, more questions than answers.
For our buccaneers, the games are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments left and also the Jurmala Masters.
Shmedin and Samoilov have never been friends in life and will not be, because there are too different personalities.
But this is also not necessary.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, the thought of divorce may also arise, since the fault will be sought not only in oneself, but also in oneself.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the beech, but John and Tom have already tried and also parted ways, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to begin to conquer the tops of the world.
One can try Harald Regge, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toch, to return to Martins Pļaviņš, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself more than once in the stages of the World Cup.
The sands of Copacabana didn't smile at them this time.
And that's it.
Of course, it should also be borne in mind that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples are entering circulation, and only a few have a height of less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is a fundamental argument in the fight for victory.
Ours doesn't stay any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the organizers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. national basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic Village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, grossly exaggerated prices were charged for the rather modest accommodations offered to journalists.
Therefore, the choice also fell on renting apartments.
There is a risk, because sometimes they can be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time, the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the border of Kopakaban and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 meters away, the bay arena half an hour's walk.
The district is safe enough, because favelas patal, but vigilance should not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich, however, is not what some immediately think of, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed up on Friday morning.
In the 100-meter hurdles and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa fell behind her personal records.
But there are already five disciplines.
After a 10-year hiatus, "Porgy and Besa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgijs un Besa" premiered in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been performed repeatedly.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsis Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum, in close cooperation, have decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin's shederva.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when liepaja was able to enjoy an opera production for the last time, this great version of george gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" opera concert production is enjoyable with us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber"," says Baiba Bože, the head of the concert hall "Great Amber".
The opera "Porgy and Besa" is a story told in vivid musical language about love, its impermanence, passion, as well as household tragedies and simple everyday joys.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It's this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance, that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and somehow really deep", says director Viesturs Kairišs.
What I like the most is when listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or a choir, or an orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the concert production of the opera "Porgijs un Besa" Andris Poga.
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are very pleased to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
Blessed to be able to feel the breath of the world in Liepaja.
"Performance professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert production was special in that in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" for the first time an orchestra played in the orchestra pit and for the first time an opera concert performance was held.
The square next to the restored building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentals.
The Vice-Mayor of Riga, Andris Ameriks Rozentāls, told the opening of the anniversary exhibition that the museum's own address in the future could also be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra Street 10a, but Janis Rozentāls Square 1.
Māra Lāce, the director of the museum, admitted that the re-registration of the address will create a considerable bureaucratic burden, however, in general, she welcomes this idea and therefore agreed with the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, creating a monument to Janis Rozentāls by Burkards Dzenis, which stands in front of the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the initiators of the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I'm a little freaked out by conscience all the time - but Wilhelm Purvis, where are we going to put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said Lacey.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art, after a major reconstruction and modernization, officially opened its doors in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace will finally begin.
The castle will be renovated by SIA Velve for approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the palace, including two auditoriums, as well as to adapt the building for people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract money from European Union funds in the amount of six million euros to the project, however, the Director of the Riga City Council's Property Department Olegs Burovs admits that at the moment there is no complete clarity on the project with European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairs to the VEF Culture Palace by attracting European structural funds is, we have been waiting for months for a decision, real action from officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether the money has been allocated or not", says Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you are deciding for yourself that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Right now, we're seeing another round of discussion forming again, well, then let's see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council guarantees without a doubt that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines", says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the immediately, immediately upcoming renovation of the building.
Although a year had passed, the renovation of the building still had not begun and collectively continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent sets of reconstruction works, each of which will ensure different implementation of the palace functions.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and improve the surrounding area.
It provides for the arrangement of the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as the restoration of the façade of the building.
The second - improvement of the service offer of the VEF Culture Palace.
It plans the restoration of the interior, walls and ceiling of the building, the improvement of the stage and sound recording studio, as well as the arrangement of the building's internal engineering communications.
The third - Improvement of working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve the equipment of workshops, heating and ventilation systems of premises.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu", the legendary rock band can be explored at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various objects characterizing "Līvus" - photographs, which are arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group's activities is announced.
The participants' stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things not yet seen by the general public, which reflected the creative activity of the group "Līvi", will also be shown.
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects from the Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians who have been associated with the band "Livy" and their relatives also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal-instrumental ensemble was created in the Liepaja House of Culture, which was led by Juris Pavītols.
The ensemble participated in the festival "Liepajas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place, when Juris Pavītols met Ēriks Ķiģelis and founded a group in the Metallurgical Palace of Culture, inviting Ingrida Gutmanis, Andris Kriņš and Jānis Grodums to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, most importantly, the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is capable of living and existing - has remained the same.
"There was no shortage of things to see - jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys were noticeably different from the generally accepted stereotype of stage singing," music reviewer Klaas Squirrel says of the band.
In addition to the aforementioned musicians, the group has included such outstanding musicians as Hugo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Fortunates Rācenājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others.
Admission to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is on view from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, liepaja concert garden "Blew, winds" will host the 40th anniversary celebration of the group "Līvi" "LĪVIfest 2".

Zbigniew Stankiewicz: The time comes, and the truth rises.
Metropolitan Zbigņevs Stankevičs, archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, emphasizes in an interview with the Independent that if we want to gain strength in life, the message of the Gospel must be placed at the heart of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the whimsy of evil.
Many are already on their way to the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has been expressed by the papal nuncie.
Consequently, the content of the main message is also at his discretion.
It has also turned out to be a kind of tradition that the Way of the Cross is headed by Bishop Jānis Bulis.
He, too, will form his own message.
I conducted a festive vigil service the day before.
Last year, I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house captured in it, the theme of the Earth in the Latvian context.
This year... Of course, I'm watching what's going on in the world and trying to respond to it in my address.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the message of the Gospel should be placed at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of a person's life and gives him inspiration for the way forward.
Then it appeals to people.
But in Cesis, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "it is necessary to return to the understanding of the full man."
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the church's message?
And does the church have the resource of such a return today?
In the Indian capital, a man dying on the side of the road is robbed.
In the Indian capital, no one has seemed to know about a man dying on the side of the road - it turns out he slept for an hour on the side of the road and then still robbed, according to the BBC.
The man, identified as Mattiboul, was reported to have ridden a rickshaw by day and worked as a security guard at night.
Matiboul was heading home on the road at 5:30 a.m. when he was hit by a car.
Surveillance camera footage shows the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then drove away.
An hour later, when no one seemed to know about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a garnish.
About 90 minutes after being hit, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to hospital, where he died from his injuries.
By withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the head of the State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova has saved the government from falling, according to Ojārs Skudra, associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kolegova's explanation for withdrawing her candidacy in connection with the controversy in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
Ant, in a conversation with the agency LETA, expressed that it was difficult for him to imagine that at next week's government meeting, "Unity" would support Kolegova's candidacy.
Consequently, if the ministers of "Unity" voted against, but Kolegov was confirmed in office anyway, this would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that before announcing the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola and the Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis.
At the same time, it was also a concession to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
Predicting whether it would be possible to find a suitable candidate through the competition, Ant admitted that there are two options - either some compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to be headed by Dace Gray as acting director-general.
At the same time, he points out that if the finance minister has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being considered, it is a hint to Gray that she should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service, Kolegova, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the SRS.
Due to objections from "Unity", the government on Tuesday postponed the confirmation of Kolegova to the post of general director of the SRS for a week.
After the government's decision to postpone the decision-making, Kolegova assured that she was still ready to become the head of the SRS.
However, later thoughts changed - on Friday, in a submission to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she states that she is withdrawing her consent to the transfer to the post of head of the SRS and this is not an easy choice for her.
Andrei Vaivars, press secretary of Prime Minister Māris Kuchinskis, explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant position of Director General of the SRS.
A crash involving a police car has occurred in the centre of Riga.
In the center of Riga this afternoon there was a road traffic accident involving a State Police car.
A police car with sound and light signals on rushed to the highest category call until another car collided at the intersection of Krišjāņa Barona and Dzirnavu streets.
Police explain the circumstances of what happened, but initial information suggests the other vehicle did not miss the police car.
A woman was injured in the accident.
This year the number of population in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, the Agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB).
In turn, in terms of the number of inhabitants, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the statistics office of the EU "Eurostat", Riga has the highest share of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly in the first place among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius it is 123, and in Tallinn it is 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed near the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be placed near the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), Baiba Gailīte, a representative of the Riga City Council Property Department, told LETA.
The repair of damage to the museum's glazed atrium, which was the result of the skateboarders' activities, has now been successfully completed.
Warning pictograms will be posted near it in the coming days.
They will tell residents that the pavement tends to be slippery during rain and snow, not to travel by car, and to ride bicycles, roller skates and skateboards.
Ushakov also wrote about the incident on Facebook at the time, who said there was no security threat to the damage but "looks unsuspecting" and skateboarders "will have to be chased."
Celebrations for children and parents - new children's playgrounds have been installed in Riga.
This summer season, Riga municipality has installed two more new playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkalns, which are currently available to children.
A spacious, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, troubadours and slides is installed on Ķīpsala beach.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
Swings and various balancing elements are also installed in the square.
The fantasy world for small sailors is brightened by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava river overlooking the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
On the other hand, in the playground between the 4th and 5th cross-lines of Čiekurkalns there is a playhouse, a trampoline, a step track, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastics area with rings for strength and coordination training, co-ops and other sports elements.
Under the area laid rubber covering in different colors.
A new, colorful pavement has been laid up to the playground from the street side.
The reconstructed section of the road has been discovered in Medumos.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, SJSC Latvian State Roads (LVC) management, as well as representatives of builders SIA "Binders" and local governments today opened the reconstructed section of the main state highway Russian border (Grebneva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (km 156.4-163.05).
Roads are the calling card of the country, especially border roads, so it is especially gratifying to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbors.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the cofinancing of European Union funds, the situation on the country's main roads is improving.
"According to the forecasts, during this planning period the funds available for roads will be absorbed already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most congested motorways in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of residents in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union", Uldis Augulis emphasized by cutting the symbolic ribbon.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads in the near future will be presented to the government.
Binders Ltd. started construction works on the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (km 156.4-163.05) last year and this year they continued after a technological break.
The reconstruction costs are 13.5 million euros (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed section of the road, the road structure has been completely restored and next year repair works will be started on the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, thus the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," informed Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The main highways of the country are the most congested, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all the main highways of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, timely ensuring periodic maintenance and carrying out the replacement of the asphalt topcoat every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all roadrunners are looking forward to the proposals made by the expert group to clean up the road financing system," Lange noted.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting in the Medumu center have been arranged.
Significant earthworks have been carried out: in four stages, large-scale dewatering and extensive excavation and embankment work, leveled the longitudinal profile of the road, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been renovated and a turning area for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient bearing capacity and the terrain of the terrain was not transparent due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old road copied the terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the section of the motorway from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (km 144.80-156.40).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of work on more than 1100 kilometers of state roads.
Information on all the repairs planned in the State motorway network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired results of weight loss, the right choice of food combinations is very important", admits Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
Thoughtful combination of dietary products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel lively.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich foods such as poultry or protein cocktail not only create a feeling of satiety, but also reduce cravings for large meals at subsequent meals.
Such a combination of dishes is also able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help get rid of the fat layer in the abdominal area.
The composition of eggs contains a metabolism-boosting nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Ingesting enough of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels, hence the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, to which fresh berries are added, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast that is worth including in your menu.
Oatmeal and berries contain fiber, which, according to the conclusions of Canadian scientists, controls grelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and therefore a feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are helpers in weight loss, and also do not allow the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to do wonders in weight loss.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, protein slows down the digestive process and provides a feeling of satiety for a longer period of time.
For lunch, you can eat chicken with a salad, or you can make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
In the fruit there are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, starch, which is contained in vegetables, is a polysaccharide.
Fruits decompose in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not decompose until they reach the third or fourth degree in the process of digestion that occurs in the intestine.
Starch breaks down into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is essential not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "trapped" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products along with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialin, which is contained in saliva, acts only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids inhibit not only the digestion of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each with different strength, features and the time to enter the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymoon, muscatel and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach along with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat forms a successful combination with starch, however, the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid consuming fat altogether.
This also applies to anointing - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains protein) with whole avocados (contains fat).
Such a combination inhibits effective weight reduction.
How better to cook?
"Cooking, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutritional composition of the products", states the nutritionist.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste by boiling foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods increases with direct boiling.
The liquid remaining after boiling the vegetables is recommended to be used to make soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables, also steaming them.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotin, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat deprives them of the natural properties of the proteins contained in them, making them easier to digest.
Also, heat treatment of meat and eggs makes iron and other minerals in the composition of these products easier to absorb by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to as much as 90%, while freezing fiber does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blood-producing iron, which is found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products, than blood-producing iron, which is found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-hematopoietic iron by consuming non-hematopoietic iron-containing products along with sources of vitamin C, such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-hematopoietic iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which ensures the delivery of oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of salads, add healthy fats to them, such as olive or linseed oil.
When making sandwiches with salmon, add to the vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines a non-additive yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and plays a vital role in the process of bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products), along with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, black currants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized for caricaturing asians
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by the animation but some commentators claim that it is racially insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity in a rather absurd way on a daily basis.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or an image that would fit into a painting by Roy Lichstanstein.
Lenses are hazy, image-crippling tools that generate more than 30 million converted selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes publicly noticeable.
Snapchat's lens effects have been criticized in the past, with accusations that the app promotes overly blackish or light facial skin tones as the benchmark for perfect beauty.
This week, the new lens effects were published that allow users to create crooked eyes, crooked teeth and round cheeks, and some critics dubbed it a racist Asian caricature – "yellow gimmick."
It was also questioned whether such contradictions suggest that the company has bigger problems with diversity.
News and public negations flared up on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard announced that lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the purpose of the lens is to depict Anime characters, not to caricature people of Asian descent.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
A Twitter post about the images by Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani gained widespread resonance. In an email, she states that the lens effects were "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least."
She added that it's hard not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And on Snapchat, the large audience of young people, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat's lenses create an image that offends users, then "things like this don't go unnoticed these days," 25-year-old Katie Zhou said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, product manager at Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article on "Medium" and in a telephone interview, she explained that she believes the problems with race are due to Snapchat's employment policies, which do not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are made. Does the company employ some representatives of other races, but they do not hold such a position as to be able to safely and comfortably express their opinion", according to Zhou, an American of Chinese descent.
Her opinion is shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the origins of its employees, but its spokesperson revealed that the company has hired an HR specialist who will focus on also representing racial minorities in the company who are not widely represented and will promote inclusion in the company.
Zhou, on the other hand, won't be renewing his Snapchat account, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to realize it's not right."
The House of Congress says military officials misrepresented reports of the Islamic State.
In a statement issued Thursday, the House of Congress said U.S. Central Command had distorted the reports, portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria far more optimistically than it actually is.
Central Command intelligence analysts express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the Republican task unit set up by the Republican representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense Financing, noting that their leadership controlled reports of American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of the report says intelligence reports confirmed by high-ranking Centcom executives reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses suggest.
California Republican spokesman Ken Calvert says, "Centcom's actions are unacceptable — our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policymakers get false reports."
Centcom's management mistakes lie in the organization's top management.
This 10-page report details the challenges facing Central Command's coverage and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration have led to misrepresentation of the reports, it does show that Centcom's leadership has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports from the Central Administration to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly stated that the Mosul recovery operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second-largest city, still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican Party spokesman Mike Pompeo says in his report, "Months of investigation clearly demonstrate this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, key officials in the U.S. Central Administration distorted the reports, portraying the ISIS threat in Iraq weaker than it actually was.
The Republican Party set up a task force to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, a report released Thursday will be followed by new findings in the case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defense conducts an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
Members of the Intelligence Administration Committee's Democratic Party released their own report Thursday in which they agree with some of the findings of the Republican Party task force.
Democrat spokesman Adam B. Schiff says in his report, from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too restricted the preparation of intelligence assessment reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that the process "stopped the dissemination of information," worsened analysts' work ethic, and "spread untrue facts."
But Schiff and Democratic Party members added that there was no evidence that the White House had pressured Centcom analysts to draft reports in accordance with "predetermined or political positions."
The Daily Beast on Thursday published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's general inspectorate had launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defense and the intelligence department call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker released a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration started the Afghan war with too little thought about its possible consequences.
Hooker also played an important role in exposing the islamic state's intelligence issue.
Last year, officials reported that Hooker's team had discovered that, contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State oil plants had not significantly worsened the terrorist group's financial situation, as they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in the September issue that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Administration.
The commander of Centcom at the time, General Lloyd Austin III, received sharp criticism, as many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. in a duel with Britain in women's field hockey, defeats the U.S., thus earning its fourth consecutive victory.
A day after the 6-1 victory over Japan, on Thursday, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team as the Americans defeated the Indian team by a score of 3-0.
Scoring five goals in two games is a memorable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam said she couldn't remember if anything like this had ever worked out for her.
She said,"I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who count the goals they score.
But she knows the Americans' score at the Olympics is 4-0, which gives them a draw in their group with Great Britain, who remained undefeated on Thursday after a 2-0 victory over Japan.
Great Britain and the U.S. will meet on Saturday to play their final match in first-round matches.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals and the game will only determine which team will take first place in the six-team group and which second.
The first-place winner will avoid meeting the strong Dutch national team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
Be that as it may, Saturday's game doesn't unfold, the Americans have already summoned a storm of surprises, taking last place among 12 teams in London four years ago.
That team also included Bama
She grew up in Blobel, she first took the field hockey stick in her hands at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player of the national team in history.
She did not go to the 2008 Olympics because she did not make it to the final.
But 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parham was appointed coach of the team and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
We didn't put in as much work in London as we do now.
We've changed everything.
In Thursday's game, Bama opened the scoring by scoring in the first half with a back-and-forth shot from close range.
India started the game without a win on their account, but their team was very fierce and kept the score at 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama scored again.
She drove the ball into the opposing zone on the left side of the field, then managed to get to the middle of the field and fire the ball into the opposing goal, putting the American in a 2-0 lead.
Midway through the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalez scored another goal.
This was the first dry game by U.S. goaltender Jackie Briggs, conceding one goal in each of her first three games.
She's run in.
And so does Bama.
"We're doing really well right now," Paham said, but just as good as the game on Saturday shows.
The most depressing food of the depressive period is the "Hearty Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the oval room for a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver pate, or fuagra, and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelman says, "It's a way to stand in solidarity in cooking with people who were doing very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds, "It's also a message to Americans on how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou's latest book, "Vegetable Stew," describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman describes life through food in a rental home in lower Eastern Manhattan in her book "97 Apple Trees."
Their new joint work, "The Hearty Meal," which will be published Tuesday by the publishing house Harper, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they had a meal with reporter Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch eatery located in the Flatiron area and operating since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelman ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while 57-year-old Kou ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable salad.
When a reporter ordered the fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very relevant to the conversation about the food of the time of the Great Depression .
Ms. Ziegelman said the fake bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut hare, a liver hare, and a bean hare.
They were made from the basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts to be instead of lunch.
Mr. Kou groaned.
"It probably felt like my stomach was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depressed years, the American dining table resembled a buffet, especially in rural areas.
The women prepared to eat for their husbands-laborers and freshly prepared casseroles were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to the Europeans. "The Hearty Meal" describes how Americans adapted to conditions when America suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the main object of attention of the American people in everyday life, "says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write specifically on this topic.
The new budget diets became just as important: unknown foods like fake bunny and stews became commonplace, stews were "a great way to take advantage of leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which for years was the main component of American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, unprecedented formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelman found a recipe for making onions stuffed with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds, "It wasn't a popular addition to the dining table."
Ms. Ziegelman emphasizes, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many recipes of homemade dishes adapted to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined the country's eating habits that had not been experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
Publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become "economists" and accept such challenges as turning a mix of pasta and carrots into a delicious meal.
"Hearty Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Evidence of the government's attitude toward its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat a cake" attitude, is particularly interesting.
Although in public he talked about his simple childhood and catering in Iowa, in fact he ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says, "He liked European cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely disconnected from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleanor, had advised him to lead by example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who didn't learn how to cook, so the White House became "a place where not only was one of the most tasteless dishes served in Washington, D.C., but also the worst-cooked dishes."
As soon as the country's economy recovered, most of the culinary customs of the Depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in cooking, Ms. Ziegelman added.
The couple say that while writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she couldn't throw food out.
"She was really afraid to throw food out," Mr. Kou said.
Ms. Ziegelman said, "She was actually freaking people out."
Once upon a time there was an incident with wind cakes.
After we had eaten at Eisenberg's eatery, a pair of writers pulled a homemade dessert out of their bag: plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's plum whipped cream," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that it was common at the time to give modest dishes a chic name.
There is no whipped cream in it, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently dipped the spoons in the brown mass that lay on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't all that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economist," he said to his wife, "A pinch of ground hazelnuts would do."
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenses in the fight with Merck over the Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the attorneys' fees paid in the case of the termination of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted in a £200 million case for breaking two Merck patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a US federal judge found violations in Merk's activities, such as lying after taking the oath and other unethical acts.
At the trial Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead has the right to seek compensation for legal expenses incurred by him in defense of the case.
Merck is trying to gain positions in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was started back in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, a key ingredient in the Gilead drug.
U.S.-backed forces say they have taken full control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have completely taken control of the city of Manbij in the northern part of the country near the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently clearing the city of the last adversary militants who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2000 civilian hostages who had been captured by militants, Sharfan Darwisch of the SDS's ally Manbij military council told Reuters news agency.
"At the moment, the city is under our full control and we are conducting a search for militants," he told the Reuters agency.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the pair paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released a 2015 tax return on Friday showing the Democratic Party's presidential nominee and her husband earning $10.75 million this year and paying the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent accordingly.
Over the course of 2015, the Clinton have donated $1 million, mostly to their Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million by speaking as speaker and former secretary of state earned $3 million in income from her book for her work at the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's electoral ally - U.S. State of Virginia Senator Tim Kane and his wife, Anne Holton, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton's campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind various pretexts and excuses to keep promises to disclose his tax information.
The disclosure of tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite an audit by the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move," Clinton campaign partner Ian Sam said in his Twitter post about the Democratic Party's candidate's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, say his refusal raises questions about his true property sizes, donation amounts and his other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton poured oil on the fire by releasing a video on Friday in which several influential Republicans are demanding Trump release his tax information.
She returned to that issue again during an economic speech Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd, "He's refusing to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico reports that for two years in the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no taxes and on Friday a New York Times business columnist said many accountants and lawyers believe nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a major issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, backing billionaire Warren Buffett's proposal, is promoting the idea that anyone who makes more than $1 million a year should pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also located, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is undergoing a Revenue Service audit and Trump is afraid of voters, not the tax authority.
Clinton's campaign has made tax information public until 2007.
Now, the Clinton live in Chapakwa, New York City and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clinton have received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes hotel in Berlin for disabling Israel's long-distance code at the request of an Arab - RT News
A French film director of Jewish descent has taken a storm on social media after revealing that the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli long-distance code. Hotel employees justify this by the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancmann, the director of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli long-distance code on the hotel's proposed list.
But this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been swept away and destroyed?
Writes Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call the country through its call center.
The director demanded an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the response he received "shocked him."
The hotel administrator explained that "this was a conscious decision of the hotel management."
The reason for removing the code further infuriated the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes a hotel employee's explanation.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung says israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, had called the case a "great shame."
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened precisely in Germany, it is in this hotel network that there is even more humiliation.
No explanation is required.
The official said: "We hope the hotel draws the right conclusions."
This event also gained quite wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel was simply indulging in Arab customers.
Another post said "be ashamed", indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly dismissed all the accusations, stating that it was all a "misunderstanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a Kempinski spokesman.
And adds that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The clash between students and police took place Thursday in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms to the government's education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to drive out students, as a result of which police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their displeasure with the reforms of the education system.
São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmina's proposal calls for the closure of nearly 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be relocated to other schools with the intent to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
The protest came just days after the previous protest, when students rallied in demonstrations to express support for suspended President Dilma Rousef, whose impeachment was voted on by the senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner finishes first, bringing Great Britain a gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skinner of Scotland finished first in the men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio velodrome, which took place last night. The British team secured its championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making legendary Scott Sir Chris Hoy proud and lifting victory for favourites New Zealand.
Four years ago, Great Britain scored a surprising victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoy had already finished his career as an athlete.
The problems were in the section between the Beijing and London Olympics, as it was necessary to replace the experienced starting specialist Jamie Staff.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton tried to fill his place.
The British coaches placed their hopes on Skinner, seeing potential in him, which he later also proved.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who competed four years ago with Hoy and Skinner, who set an Olympic qualifying record, but the race got off to a better start for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindes were in close pros after their lap, Kenny took the lead and Skinner secured that lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory as the Hindes drove in greater gear to allow Kenney and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes the moment they climbed to the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow said: "It was an unspeakable honor."
I'm doing everything to defend my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoya at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes confessed to deliberately falling on the track after a failed start.
He later refuted that comment and the British rivals had no way of proving otherwise.
This time, however, there were no such incidents.
Hindus said: " British flags in the stands recalled London."
Over the past 3 months, we have become a cohesive team.
We've lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal in the race for the country, which won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the team's progress over the past five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenny's result, he could really replicate Hoy's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenny, that would mean six gold won and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was also born on March 23 (it looks like this is a British holy date, since Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were also born on this day).
On this date, Hoy was also born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "Right now I'm just enjoying it all.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
Honestly, it's a little lonely to win alone."
Hindus said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only fight for medals that day, but that wasn't the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualifying time in the four-kilometre pursuit of the foursome.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday, before the qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the commissariat when the judges summoned him to measure his height.
In the women's race, which will continue and end today, Laura Trott, Joanne Rovsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milnegavia set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hoping. will win medals in the middle of the Olympics.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performances in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio as well.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, various things have gone, after accusations of sexism and defamation of dignity, technical director Shane Sutton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also end their careers.
But as the first cycling race begins, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland smelter is becoming uncertain as an ambitious contract is terminated.
The future of the aluminum smelter and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of cooperation.
This statement is based on the Victorian government's plans to end subsidizing the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidies will end in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of victoria's entire power supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the "Point Henry" smelter, which led to a break in the operation of the Angleseas power plant.
Alkoas Portland's smelter is operating at a loss and may be closed.
These events were triggered by years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of the plant's production.
The plant's energy supplier, AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latroube Valley, says it's likely the other three owners will also terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plant is owned by the joint venture "Alcoa" and "Alumia", in addition to the company's shares are owned by the holding companies of China "CITIC" and "Marubeni Corp" in Japan.
AGL is hoping for the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supplies to the smelter," its spokesman said.
AGL said the contracts were so-called "risk-limiting contracts" that are expected to take effect from November 2016.
Contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
AGL expects to receive revenue from these contracts for fiscal year 2017 as well," a company spokesperson said.
Starting from fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims to have already counted $187 million in losses in its forecasts — anticipating that those contracts would be terminated.
Alcoa says the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue operating the smelter or supply it with energy.
The U.S. company says it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but it will be terminated in November. The Company does not provide any explanation as to why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have raised concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the industry's weak economy.
AGL CEO Steven Mickelson said last week that analysts estimate Portland uses 600 megawatts of energy and Tomago's 900 megawatts of energy over the course of a year.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, then energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community Legal Center rejects 160,000 people each year.
Every year, the claims of more than 160,000 people are rejected, and with a decrease in the budget, the situation could get worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal evictions - are refused free legal aid and representation.
The community's legal center, which is already overburdened, warns that with a decrease in funding, the situation will only get worse.
Already from June next year, these legal centers will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said the latest report from the National Association of Legal Centres says legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people in need.
Mr. Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not reversed, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says, "Queensland's law centre is constantly underfunded, meaning thousands of people in need are being denied help."
People who are trying to put an end to violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who are going through divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning several thousand more Queensland residents will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately halt the cuts so that people in need of legal aid can obtain it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now it's time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers, and the Palazchuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after one of the employees pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organizers have been sued for failing to act after receiving information that its North Carolina operations manager turned a firearm at an employee when they were driving in the same car in February.
The incident was described in a court lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte Court by Vincent Bordini - a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had waited for months for the case to be heard internally, but understood it wouldn't happen.
Driver Earl Phillips "pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on his and pointed the barrel at Vincent's knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by filing complaints with local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
"Guns don't have to fire to cause damage," Bordini says in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was filed, the Republican Party's nominee for president sparked a scandal by telling people that "Second Amendment people," i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in the event that his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges won the election.
Representatives of the Trump campaign said the media had taken his words out of context, and he never instigated violence against anyone.
With his claim, the Bordins want to seek compensation from campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, and from Phillips for assault, illegal weapon use and causing emotional stress.
Trump spokeswoman Houpa Hicks did not immediately comment.
Failed to contact Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Phillips has recently quit campaigning.
Also, it has not been possible to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
The Republican Party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has waged a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - parish and sports festival in Ķūļciems.
On Saturday in Kūļciems, for the first time, people gathered for the parish and sports festival.
After celebrating ten years, this time it was decided that there would be no more Lake Festival.
A new page has now been turned.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time, the competition was not in traditional ways and too serious to take, because, for example, darts had to be thrown at a sleeping target, a boot flew, thrown with a person's left hand, "bumblebee" was not at all at any Olympics.
However, each participant could show how strong, courageous, agile and resourceful he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in an open-air stage, where the parish festivities began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could into inflatable attractions and get a new image in the face makeup room.
A novelty that could also become a tradition was the parade of driveways, in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
Everyone was addressed by Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, the head of Ķūļciems parish administration, who wished her a nice rest and dry weather, the rain still fell, but it could not interfere much.
The festivities continued with the greeting of the younger inhabitants of Kūļciems.
It's really good that the parish has added five girls and one boy.
Amateur art collectives from Engure region had come to the villagers with performances - the audience really liked the performances of the senior dance group "Autumn Rhythms", dance performers of different nations "Redas" and youth dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's not for nothing that on the wet stage someone happened to slip too.
Of course, local people and visitors were delighted by the famous duet of actors Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrite Krāniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Bērzciems from the fishermen's farm "Dieniņa".
The ball was played by the group "Bruģis".
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but across the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we put in a huge amount of work to make all regions of the country benefit from the Olympics .
Stratford and East East won an awful lot from the Olympics.
And we will do it again, providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As with the London Olympics in 2012, this time there will be people who believe that the challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics in time and that it would be a worldwide failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012 and in Heathrow's case, too, they won't be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a breeding ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
Heathrow is staffed by a great team that has created an £11 billion infrastructure investment program, within the time frame and budget, from Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years from the site, to Terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensively used runways in the world.
They are now ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by a £16 billion private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that this will be the case with Heathrow's enlargement.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment of which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of the Heathrow Board and a former Secretary of Commercial Affairs at the Ministry of Economy.
In Switzerland, a woman runs onto a highway trying to commit suicide.
The injured one landed on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when several cars drove over her on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident happened on Thursday shortly after midnight on an A1 road near the town of Morgue in the canton of Vo.
A police report from the canton of Vo said that desperately wanting to commit suicide, the woman had settled down on the road in the dark, where she was hit by several cars.
In a clear attempt to kill himself, the victim, the 49-year-old Swiss, was hit by several cars, including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, while others involved have not yet been identified, police say, which is calling for the drivers involved and witnesses to the incident to be recalled.
A criminal investigation has also been launched into the case, which is a logical step in such a case, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds, "The prosecutor will find out."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years suggest that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that there would be a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a police woman was acquitted of negligent killing when, in August 2014, she drove a man who was sleeping on an A1 road near Paijerne in the middle of the night.
The court found out that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later managed to fall asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman who was on her way to the scene of the accident drove in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge found that the sleeping man on the road was a "completely unpredictable and extraordinary case."
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morgue is urged to contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are collected on the Internet for the organisation of a competition for the position of a new SRS manager.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has started collecting signatures for the organisation of a new competition for the position of the head of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition, which is addressed to the ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), states that the public wants a transparent and professional process of nominating officials.
The petition was created on August 10 and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating Inga Kolegova, an applicant for the position of Director General of the SRS, is opaque and unprofessional.
It brings to mind the best traditions of functionaries of the Soviet Union.
This discredits public administration and once again disappoints the public in government and politicians.
"There needs to be a contest with clear criteria against which all candidates must be judged," the petition's text reads.
Its author, John B., pointed out that the criteria for how Kolegov was chosen for the position are not known to the public.
It is also not clear what the candidate's intentions are for working for the SRS.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new, open competition, in which professional candidates are actively addressed, personnel selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially nominated Kolegova for the post of head of the SRS last week, this week the government was supposed to confirm him to the new position, but all the ministers of the Unity party voted against, so the issue of a week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, so I played badly.
Beach volleyball players Alexander Samoilov and Jānis Šmediņš have hoped for an award at the Rio Olympics, however, without getting to it, it makes no difference where to close the competition, Samoilov said after withdrawing from the tournament.
One of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs lost 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) to Brazilians Evandra Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgada in the final and decisive game of the sub-group tournament on Thursday, concluding their participation in the four-year major sporting forum.
In three matches of the subgroup, Latvian athletes scored one victory, but two more pairs had the same ratio.
Next, the ratio of small points between three pairs was counted, which after the convincing loss suffered in this match was the most unfavorable for the Latvian duo.
"We were in the lead in the first set, but from 16:15 we stayed for 16 points," Schmidt recalled of the game.
I don't even know how we stayed scoreless for the rest of the set.
You can't play like that.
After that, everything was fine in the second set and managed to break the game at the top of the set, plus it should have been a good foundation for the third set as well.
We started it in a similar way, but after we swapped sides, the result only grew for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all the teams were similar, there were three sets in almost all matches, so the small points were important.
"It was necessary to play more similarly, rather than giving away 3-4 points in a row several times," the athlete said.
We knew evandra could be served.
"We dealt with it in the first set, we let in 1-2 points in the second, and in the third at +4 he already had a game," Recalled Schmedin.
We tried to show the best game.
At times it came together, sometimes it didn't.
I didn't look at the overall situation before the match, but it was known that I needed as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, so I played badly," Samoilov said.
We expected a good serve from Evandru and we dealt with it pretty well in the first sets, but in the third he opened up a serve and it was difficult to build an attack.
I, on the other hand, made a lot of mistakes right at Pedru's serve, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, today the athletes did not have nervousness.
"We went, we played, the defense was too, but we needed a better reception," the athlete said.
"They played well and ended up on 'hurrah'."
Before the tournament, we said right away that the draw was the most awkward it could have been.
We had a chance to fight for first place as well, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"All of us expected a medal and so did we, but after that there is already no difference - 25th or fourth", said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I don't think there will be any questions and let's continue to play together because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov had the third Olympic Games in his career in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 in Beijing he competed with Martins Pļaviņš, and four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
Meanwhile, for Schmidt, this was his second start at the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of both a consumer and a potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, the company's press secretary.
"The decision on whether latvenergo will also join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by what gas market model and regulatory framework will be created."
"For our part, we are actively involved in drafting and commenting on legislation and submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
Agency BNS already wrote that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed draft Cabinet regulations "Regulations for the Trade and Use of Natural Gas" that will change the existing principles of operation of the natural gas market, ensuring the right of natural gas users to freely choose a natural gas trader from April 3, 2017.
While working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and understandable as possible.
Therefore, the "merchant-centric model" has been chosen as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one place of provision of information and customer service, leaving to the discretion of the distribution system operator the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
We remind you that gradual opening of the market is planned for household customers - even after April 3, 2017, those household customers who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related customers.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related customers at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader", the ministry informed.
In turn, merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to enter into a natural gas trade contract.
Until entering into a natural gas trade contract, trade in natural gas for a specific period of time shall be ensured to merchants by the previous natural gas trader for the price specified thereby.
The draft Cabinet regulations specify in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
This Regulation prescribes the procedures by which natural gas shall be supplied to customers and the supply thereof shall be discontinued, the requirements for safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, public trader, system operator, user, and owner of the gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures for making settlements for the services received, the amount of late payment interest, the procedures for changing traders and supplying customers in the event of disruptions in the supply of natural gas; the procedures by which the supply of natural gas to related customers shall be ensured by a public trader.

Minister: Next week it is planned to discuss an increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the SRS.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Peasants (ZZS)) plans to talk with Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (ZZS) and the government's coalition partners next week about increasing the remuneration of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the SRS general director needs to be addressed urgently in order to make the position more attractive to potential applicants for the re-competition.
There will also be talk next week about changing the conditions of the competition.
The minister also stressed that she did not have any specific candidate in mind to address for the vacant position.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, would have been a good general director of the SRS.
On the other hand, with regard to the current acting head of the SRS, Daci Gray, who has expressed her readiness to apply for this position, the minister reiterated the opinion that the new Director-General of the SRS should have a "view from the outside" and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also emphasized that she is waiting for the Saeima to return from vacation in order to push forward the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganization of the SRS as soon as possible.
Agency BNS has already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service Inga Kolegova has submitted an application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), in which she withdraws her candidacy for the post of Director General of the SRS.
In the submission, she said it was not an easy choice, but over the past two weeks, her loved ones have experienced serious emotional pressure, although they have not taken any actions that are reprehensible by law.
Likewise, Kolegova pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has multiplied the contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition, which is also unacceptable.
It was also reported that the previous Director General of SRS, Ināra Pētersone, left her post at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchange indices in the US and Europe, as well as the value of the US dollar, are increasing.
Global oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investor sentiment positively impacted by statements by Saudi Arabia's oil minister, which reinforces expectations that major oil-producing countries will take action to stabilize the global oil market at an upcoming OPEC meeting in September.
The three main U.S. stock exchange indices hit record highs on Thursday that hadn't been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of a number of large companies.
Rising oil prices and strong financial performance by several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock exchange indices.
The US dollar appreciated on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the price of WTI-branded crude oil for deliveries in September rose $1.78 to $43.49 a barrel on Thursday.
The price of Brent crude oil for deliveries on the London Stock Exchange in October rose by 1.99 dollars - to 46.04 dollars per barrel.
The turnover of the canning manufacturer "Blue Lagoon" fell by 33.8% last year.
The turnover of the canning manufacturer "Blue Lagoon" last year was 4.202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year earlier, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the database "Lursoft".
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company worked with losses incurred for a number of reasons, including a constant shortage of working capital, which was caused by the departure of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, terminating the previously valid credit line, and leaving the "Blue Lagoon" with concluded contracts without the possibility of fulfilling them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large volumes and receive a volume discount.
The bank's departure from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing support projects from the European Union Structural Funds, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
Also, the company's financial indicators last year were negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized price changes and were ready to purchase goods at the new - the highest - prices", according to the company's management.
Also in 2015, "Blue Lagoon" began negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been to the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have become acquainted and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development were positively affected by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows to achieve greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment was purchased that provides a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of the "Blue Lagoon" notes that the purchased equipment in 2016 will allow the company's production facility to fulfill such orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since letters of intent on the sale of the product have already been signed, everything produced will be sold according to the letters of intent.
The new product will increase the turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", according to the company's management.
In August 2016, the company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq.
In 2016, the "Blue Lagoon" has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the outlet to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, "Blue Lagoon" worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and a loss of 5.113 million euros.
"Blue Lagoon" was founded in 1997 and its share capital is 1,156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Shirshon (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 at the museum to meet cinema diva Sarah Leander and participate in a press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning of the career and inspiration of the adored film diva Sarah Leander.
Sarah Lendere's visit to her godmother Ruth, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924 turned out to be fatal, because it was she who revealed to Sarah Leander's woman the unusual low contralto, which she tried on her debut on the stage of the Riga Cabaret Theater.
Perhaps it was the randomness in Riga that became the fateful turn in the Saar's creative path towards world fame.
Riga was associated with warm memories for Sarah Leander, and she hoped to come to Riga for guest shows, but, unfortunately, these hopes were not destined to come true, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the show, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016, and the great Ieva Kerēvica will play the role of the outstanding Sarah Leander.

A group of 30 Kurds on Thursday evening occupied the public broadcaster WDR's building in Düsseldorf, where they staged a nearly two-hour protest campaign, according to German police.
The demonstrators, who arrived with placards with them, chanted various slogans in an attempt to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
Officials say the demonstration was generally peaceful and protesters eventually left the building voluntarily at the request of employees.
The insurer is compensating passengers of the flight cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance has paid travel insurance indemnity to a family for the flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, due to which it was necessary to refuse to attend the planned music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received an indemnity application from a customer.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since this was not possible due to flights cancelled at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged a reward for booking accommodations that could no longer be canceled, as well as for purchased festival tickets in the amount of 204 euros.
In turn, the money spent on plane tickets has been promised to be reimbursed by the airline to customers.
On average, 15% of all travel insurance claims have been compensated for travel interruptions or cancellations.
"At such times, expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for booking accommodation, are reimbursed," says Dagnija Rutka, product manager at If Insurance Personal Risk Insurance.
As is known, on the evening of August 10, a private jet stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical problems, so several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
Due to a neighbor's repair, a man is knocked to a shattered ceiling and forced to leave his home.
The ATV program "Studio 4" was approached by Dmitry Saidyashev, whose neighbor has begun overhaul in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been crumbling plaster from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and the ceiling in my apartment is damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the building manager and other organizations.
The building board said we are not an operational service and we don't have any expertise.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and from there there will be an expert", says Dmitrijs.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and admitted that the covering was in unsatisfactory condition.
But a month has passed since Dmitry's first application to the construction board, and by the beginning of this week, no one could answer whether being in the apartment was not life-threatening.
The construction board said - this is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they transferred the house to the manager, then the house manager again to the construction board, and then there is a dead end", says Dmitry.
After examining the entire pile of papers, what is clear is that the construction work has been suspended, although every now and then you can hear that someone is working there.
Within a further two months, an inspection had to be carried out and, within six months, all those defects had to be rectified by the owner of the apartment carrying out the repairs.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this load-bearing structure has been affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"Therefore, we have requested additional clarification from this expert," says Ilze Žūka, a representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repair work in the upper apartment, from there it is still heard that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in a particular case the penalty can be much more severe.
While awaiting the expert's opinion, the construction board has decided that both apartments should not be operated - both the one in which the construction work is taking place and Dmitry's apartment.
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the building board, where in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have posed a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot operate his property," says a spokeswoman for the construction board.
Now it remains for Dmitry to look for another place to live - with relatives, friends, in a hotel, or to rent another apartment.
But dmitry may try to recover the losses incurred from a neighbor in a civil manner, which, however, can take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the civil engineer gives his conclusion, and it may have to wait up to three weeks.
The losses incurred will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment where the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment, because he has not taken into account what the construction board said, also faces a prison sentence of up to six months.
Guess what!
How many lionesses in this picture?

The transformation of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, a representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri", tells LETA agency.
The creation of the hotel is the first stage of the renovation of the former Kemeri sanatorium.
The second phase will be the "wellness" or wellness clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is currently unknown.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Kemeri resort polyclinic, which covers an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and the planned clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest money in this fund, according to Želve.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier, it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in the creation of the former resort polyclinic, with a total investment amount exceeding 30 million euros.
It has already been announced that in the restoration of the cultural and historical park on an area of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of access roads and street sections, the construction of an interactive nature tourism object, landscaping of the territory and the construction of parking lots on Emīla Darzina Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists, Jurmala City Council plans to attract 14.5 million euros from the resources of the European Union funds, co-financing with three to four million euros.
By the middle of 2017, design works are planned, but construction work and arrangement works will begin in the autumn of next year.
As reported, in the historical sanatorium complex "Kemeri" it is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and a "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction took a long time.
In turn, in the annual report for 2010, it was also stated that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control in the sanatorium "Ķemeri", and already in 2011 the reconstruction of the future hotel "Ķemeri" will definitely be "completed" and preparations for the opening of the hotel of the "Kempinski" chain will immediately begin.
In October 2014, "Park Hotel Ķemeri" confirmed its readiness to purchase the totality of the Kemeri sanatorium property owned by the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" at the auction, but a month later the auction was declared not to take place, because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the specified time.
The sale price was set according to the starting price of the last auction that did not take place - 2.86 million euros.
As the agency LETA was informed by the representative of the city council Ieva Aile, the municipality, by signing the protocol, has confirmed that with the support of co-financing from the European Union Structural Funds, it will clean up the adjacent infrastructure - restore the historic Kemeri Park, create an interactive nature tourism object, arrange roads and parking lots.
The president will present the Order of the Three Stars to the opera singer Antonenko.
President of Latvia Raimonds Vējonis will present the Order of the Three Stars' III class to opera singer Alexander Antonenko next week, August 16, according to the president's agenda.
The ceremony of awarding the Order of the Three Stars will be held at the House of Blackheads at 13 p.m.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from Jāzeps Medinis College of Music in 1998, where he studied wind instruments and learned singing with Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Department of the Jāzeps Vītols Latvian Academy of Music in the class of Arvīds Luste.
In 1997 he started singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera, but in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in G.F. Hendel's opera "Alčīna".
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" for his vocal performance in opera performances and Verdi's Requiem.
It is indicated that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, which is anglicised by the largest opera houses in the world.
Since autumn 2004, he has been singing "Düsseldorf's Deutsche Oper am Rhein", the Berlin and Graz Opera, the Dresden Semperoper, the Royal Opera in Oslo and Stockholm, the London Covent Garden Opera, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf Opera and the Salzburg Festival.
Antonenko in 2009 with great success made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the role of the Prince in "The Mermaid".
In turn, in 2011, Antonenko sang the title role "Othello" at the Paris Opera with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, at the Covent Garden Opera he sang in the new production of Luigi "The Cloak", as well as in Stockholm he took part in the "Girl from the West" staged by Christoph Loy.
A year later, Antonenko sang with great success the role of Othello at London's Covent Garden Opera.
Former NATO commander Bradlow's email has been hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) allegedly carried out several other cyberattacks also hacked the email of Philip Bradlow, a former commander of NATO's European forces, and the servers of the George Soros Institute's Open Society, business news agency Bloomberg reported Thursday.
Hackers have published the obtained information on the site "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, Bridlow's correspondence and news of the work of the Soros Institute are also posted there.
For hackers, the institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian special services who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, for its part, reports that U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is currently considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
To implement sanctions, the administration will have to formally accuse Russia or hackers backed by Russian authorities in a cyberattack on Democratic Party servers.
The WikiLeaks website reportedly released about 20,000 emails in July obtained from the DNC's computer system, suggesting that Democratic Party leaders had tried to harm the campaign of party candidate Hillary Clinton's former rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, in the fight for a Democratic nomination to run in the presidential election.
As reported by U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts an investigation into the hacking of Democratic servers, as well as other U.S. special services, believe Russia's connection to the cyberattack is almost unquestionable.
McCartney: Yoko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles."
Paul McCartney has admitted that Yoko Ono's presence has created a sense of danger to the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but at the time she went to visit the band at the recording studio, she was terrified of McCartney because Ono was the only woman among the band members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationship between the two, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine: "They're really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the group couldn't bear it.
We were able to do it, but not very successfully, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls didn't usually come to the recording studio, they let us run.
When John started dating Yoko, she wasn't sitting in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of the blockbuster "Yellow Submarine" has also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former bandmate Ringo, and from time to time confirms the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" have "ceased to function".
Asked if he's still dating the other only still-living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to meetings, I feel a little dissociated from it.
I left "Apple" during a difficult divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful, as if seeing his pet die.
The company is now working in such a way that I just listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Research have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was developed to determine whether there have ever been Earth-like conditions on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon.
Scientists have previously made guesses that the slow speed of rotation of Venus is explained by the dense atmosphere.
But recent simulations suggest that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and was spinning slowly.
The model also looks at the earliest topography of Venus.
There were more arid areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to allow life to form and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the Sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus spin model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts 2 months, GISS scientist Antony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes rain, which, in turn, forms layers of thick clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the Sun.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is formed, which, in fact, is a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, over the billions of years Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans evaporated, and the spirits were burned out by ultraviolet rays.
As the water evaporated completely, only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas remained - Venus as we know it today.
The scientists published the results of the new climate model of Venus in the journal "Geophysical Research Letters".
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy submitted his resignation, citing as a reason the insufficient influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakik confirmed the news and informed that the club would immediately begin looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties energetically, passionately and purposefully as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado club," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
Over the course of this summer, I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team's performance to give it the brilliance it needs and achieve higher-level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of hockey operations must fully coincide with those of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions that relate to the performance of the team.
At the moment, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs, the Colorado team was defeated by Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club has not made it to the playoffs for two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team without winning the Western Conference hosts' second special invitation.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career — two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and postpone strike
Workers' strikes on North Sea oil rig workers' pay have been postponed as the two sides in the dispute have resumed talks, according to negotiators.
Periodically, strikes are held against the oil processing company "Wood Group" on the oil platforms of the North Sea, in which the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
The joint statement said the Wood Group and United and RMT unions had agreed to resume talks to resolve the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are scheduled for the coming weeks, which will begin early next week with the aim of revisiting the issues at stake.
The unions said their recent events, organized after more than 25 years of hiatus, targeted a planned 30 percent pay cut.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cut wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional salary cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, meanwhile, has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to shut down oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger deal with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier in the week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues, the North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, up from $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the constellation Pleiades.
The mission of the latest Kepler telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the speed of rotation of stars in the constellation Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the speed of rotation of stars refers to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebula, a scientist at Pasadenas Caltech's Infrared Processes and Analytical Center, told a news release.
The constellation Pleiades is located at a distance of 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to rise, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at maximum speed.
Rotating at maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of stellar wind.
As the winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, determining the time between the appearance of recognizable areas of stars, such as solar spots.
The latest catalog of the speed of rotation of stars shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars with dancers, dancers of greater stature perform pirouettes more slowly than dancers of small stature.
Rebul says the Pleiades' "ballet" shows that slow-rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster-rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the constellation Pleiades is located so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebul tells us that the constellation Pleiades helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of rotation of stars slows down and about their complete stop process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of the speeds of rotation of the Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
