Jauno Dr. Strikes: Calls for a new protest against the death penalty
Jauno's doctors' representatives are urging their armed forces to launch a protest strīdā over the new contract.
The British Medical Association's (LMA) Jauno medical committee (JAK) is about to ask the Padomi to support the plašākus protestus in early September.
JAKlv considers that the ministers have the right to issue a contract.
In July, a new group of doctors and medical students were offered a contract by the LMA.
The contract was awarded 58% of all bidders who participated in the vote.
In a tweet posted on Thursday evening, JAK board member Elena Makkorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract offer is not accepted.
She said: "We must take into account that as a result of the JAK vote, the contract offer was fully rejected and the decision taken to request new formal negotiations was not taken, in order to discuss more important issues".
At the height of the government shutdown, JAK today formally requested the signing of the LMA padomi, to authorize the development of a new contract, which would come into force in September.
As a result of the strikes, young doctors took part in six strikes, including, for the first time in NHS history, a work stoppage.
After the vote, the LMA offered the terms of the contract, as recommended by the BMA, but the LMA resigned the new medical representative, Dr. Johans Malawana.
Before enrolling 54,000 new medical students, he was a member of the BMA, offering labs to be used.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hants informed that the contract would be concluded with the British media.
Russia un Turcija: Atstumlvto allianse?
Žlvests, as a means of ending the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey have been warned that the sanctions will be lifted by eight months.
But Vladimir Putin, who has been a key figure in Turkey's leadership in St Petersburg, is reluctant to accept that Ankara needs more of this partnership.
However, the aboveground was shattered.
Vladimir Putin smaids looked like a samākslots un neizlvīja siltas emocija, not given his previous actions.
Turpretī redžeps Tajjips Erdogans at least five times have been a victim of Putin's "dārgo draugu", a form of protest.
The man is the number one.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the level of the crisis, but would become even stronger.
The next day some newspapers reported that Erdoğan's own actions would have been unnoticed.
I think that her enthusiasms are causing pretrunjan izjūtas.
But no Putin's ancient accounts suggest that Russian leaders were not a part of the agenda.
The first time he competed in his own race, Russian planes were flying near the Syrian border.
This time, Moscow reacted with pity.
Putin accused Ankarlv of being a disgraced Maskavas mugurā.
The loss was even more painful, considering the work of the friend.
Atjalvunot patiesu's loyalty will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia's public nostalgia has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television broadcast aggressive abuses against Ankaru.
Suddenly, the Turkish people were in vain.
The charges against the Visnopietnākās were filed, with the Erdoğan family themselves stealing profits from the illegal oil trade and the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He's not a bad guy, of course.
But the main message of the Sanktpēterburgas's arrival is that the time has come to forget about the pagātni.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received a pardon from President Erdogan.
Russia could not accept any kind of victory.
Ankaras has no merit for excellence and obviousness.
First, Erdogan needs to see possible friends after the unfortunate turn of events last month, in which he was tried.
Also, the terrorist Uzbuksumi has been satirized and his positions questioned.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused significant losses, especially the imposition of sanctions, which usually provide several million Russian tourists with the Turkish citizenship every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies also facilitate the use of the site, as they will update the regular services.
They are looking for a break to play at Vidusjūrā at the end of the season.
As of this week, state TV is forecasting a decline in the price of vegetables, with Turkey's imports of vegetables and fruits being updated.
Kālv citē vietnisches laikraksts Vedemosti: "Tūristus viņiem, tomatoes mums".
But the visit also had other political motives on the part of the Maskovs.
Ankara is hostile to the West, but it seems to be a weak reaction to the attempted coup.
Pielv visa var pieskatīt also the dissatisfaction and the inadequate negotiations for EU accession un Putin is willing to take advantage of the situation, to Turkey and the West.
Russian leaders were unwilling to gain the additional point of Ankaras acīs, which was their support for the elected government after an attempted coup.
Take into account, as Maskava has always understood, the deeply entrenched dances and regimes in the country.
The Samlvits, which took place in this grey piejūras pilī, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as was the case with some analytics, "atstumto alliances", two countries, as jutas atstumtas no Rietumiem, combining forces.
But despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
Galvenās nesaskaņas skarlv Sīriju, where Russia presents itself as a miera nesēju, but in fact Russia un Turcija supports the other parties.
After more than three hours of initial discussions, and not wanting to disclose information, the presidents announced at a press conference that they had discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about the two-state rivalry, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is clear consensus that the two countries could find common ground on Syria.
But months later, a potential disaster was revealed to the hostile relationship, when NATO member Turkey notified the Russian air force of the situation and the situation improved, with both leaders at least abstaining from the sarunas.
Skotijas Karaliskā Banka will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Zīmolam SKBlv will continue to be a supporting role, the bank's executive directors announced.
The Ārpus Skotijas SKBlv will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland, that SKB's brands were associated with ambitious banks on a global scale.
She refused to pursue these ambitions, as eight years ago the bank nearly went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Experts in branding strategy have used SKB's trademark to disregard other consumer financial trademarks.
Banka received millions of marks from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations rugby union team and ending with the Vimbldonas tennis champion Endiju Mureju.
But now they are not allowed to set the precedent for other national stamps.
Skotijas Karaliskā Banaka will be available to Skotijas customers, but the netiks has been initialized.
In England, un Velsālv visas SKB references, outside the head office of an official stock exchange, will be designated under the name NatWest.
The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have already issued a number of stamps of The Ulster Bank.
Now, more private financial brands are also being considered, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevans were interviewed during the visit by clients and employees at Invernesšīru.
He told BBC Scotland Channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and our employees will work, and now we are becoming more of a bank brand".
In time, the bank became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now that we no longer have global ambitions, we are no longer going to have mega-ambitions.
Katrslv on these brands represents a unique brand in their industry and our employees work with clients under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not sponsor the "Six Nations" and will participate in various sports sponsorship events.
"It is high time to become a branded bank, and we have already asked ourselves the question, how can we become a bank to our customers?" the executives say.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical, and we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these stamps.
But thanks to a strong focus on customer needs rather than our own, we have obviously made a lot of changes.
We can once again make these seals, so I think now is the time.

Russian President Putin is the head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the alleged atlaidis of the head of the Russian administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanovs have for many years attracted Putin's attention to the human race.
Now 63 years old, the politician is elected by the special representative of the people in transportation matters.
The Kremlin's statement said Putin "will be relieved of Ivanov's duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", and there were no reasons.
Ivanova was replaced by amateur ice hockey player Antons Vaino, who had been his Vietnamese since 2012.
44 years old Vaino is a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
He later published the Presidential Protocol on the Administration of Government Employees.
After his appointment, he said to Putin: "Paldies for your loyalty".
I think the main job of the administration is to support your work as the national president, developing a likumus un while controlling your decision execution.
Putin's Friday speech was a response to the Russian raid, and Ivanov's speech was a response to the fact that he recommended Vaino as his replacement.

Sergei Ivanovs and Vladimir Putin's allies, like Putin, are now working for the Padomju security service VDK.
In this capacity he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a televised address, the husband announced that Ivanov's resignation would be his own initiative.
Betlv despite the cameras watching smaidiem, reti and such paskaidrojums convince, especially before parliamentary elections.
Vailv tas ir iznākums, which is related to the struggle for varu?
I don't know any of the names.
But official claims that the virus, which was thought to be a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the leader of Russia's foreign policy, led to great skepticism.
In a note published on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said to Putin: "As a matter of fact, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to entrust me with this complicated, if you will, problematic, four years.
Israādlvās, I have been working in this profession for four years and eight months.
Ivanov's amate was terminated in December 2011.
Previously he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former VDK National Security Service employee, as is Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin left the Federal Security Service, as the VDK had been in power, Ivanovs took his Vietnamese lover.
When Putin came to the floor, he called Ivanov to the five people in the number, where he uttered the most uttications.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanlovs were considered a potential Russian presidential candidate, and Putin's re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then, as president, Putin's allies - Dmitrijs Medvedev - became the only ones.
Putin became prime minister, and after three or four years he was relieved of his presidency.

Kvīnsferijas crostojlvums: the tilts are now and the links are Faifu.
The 1.35 billion mark project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Kvīnsferijas crostojuma a viaduct, that is, to tilts now and to connections in Faifu.

Maikls Martins, project director for the bridge connections, said: "The first connection was a very important point in any bridge construction".
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrated the highest level of engineering.
After the last post-installation of the road and the connection of the north tower with the support of the north tower, we were able to connect the north to the ground part of the viaduct.
When this was done, the area was divided into a viaduct section of 700 millimetres.
It was a very delicate operation at the same time.

After Jeremy Hanta's rejection of the offer, the young doctors plan to strike more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute, to reach an agreement on changes to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 per cent against 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July Hants announced that the contract had been signed, indicating that the NHS was in a volatile state and that only the staff of a patient would be affected.
Many new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to working conditions overnight and on weekends, in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, BMA's new physician representative Dr. Elena Makourta announced that new doctors were still seriously surprised by the contract offer, especially as the labour crisis was slowing and not all doctors were given equal conditions.

These medications are already prescribed for use 12 months after heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks.
NHS representative NICE recommended using this preparation four years after heart failure, to further reduce the risk of heart failure in people with heart and blood vessel problems.
However, at present, the NHS review, which is published by NICE, recommends using this drug four years after heart attacks, in order to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel damage.
Every four years, about 140,000 people in England experience a stroke and a quarter of them experience repeated heart attacks or insults.
A stroke causes a buildup of fat in the heart muscle, forming a series of spasms.
The aizsprostojums then plough, creating a tube, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if thrombs occur and no blood vessel seizures occur, the blood vessels must be moved further away and blood access to the brain is blocked, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are subjected to repeated heart attacks.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca, is a brand of tirgo called Brilique, which is similar to the risk of developing a tube.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin.
NICE Health Technology Director Professor Kerola Longsona explained: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another stroke or stroke, which is often a complication".
Bailes no repeated sirdstriekas var leave a negative impression on the quality of human life.
Studies show that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people who have experienced them.
Provisionally, we are willing to treat Ticagrelor, so that we can expand the treatment options to thousands of people, thus benefiting them.
Given the limited information about Ticagrelor's safety and efficacy, especially the risk of seizure, when using this drug for longer than every three years, the vadlvline project does not recommend using it for longer than this deadline.
The culture of the political system promotes the corruption of Muslims during the elections.

The report was commissioned by Dauningstrīta after a scandal surrounding the Tauerhamletas municipal election.
Last year, a special election court ruled to suspend the city's Lutfuru Rahmanu post office and to start a corrupt city post office due to illegal activity.
The court found that Rahman's "Chinese sacredness" to his Muslims, his copy of religious taxation, and his criticism of racism, had been confined to Islamophobia.

Srs. Eriksen has taken action to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of identity documents, to identify individuals.
Her reports read: "Research shows that vulnerable ethnic minorities in the bible, especially women and young people, are being honestly voted by the older selected candidates, especially Bangladesh and Pakistan".
"It is a surprise that the authorities are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, which could undermine ethnic and religious interests".
Sers Ēriks outlined 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, including a ban on political activists working with ballots, casnots and postal mail, to prevent "balsu vākání".
The report, by Terlvza Meja, also called for a thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists to defraud immigration and benefits.

Srs. Eriks has criticized the Metropolitan Police, while not expressing it, for the Tauerhamletas case and the allegations made against them.
He recalls: "The Velvelshan court merely disqualified Lufturu Rahmanu and his representative for acts related to corruption and corruption".
He convinced the jury to find the standard evidence of criminal truth invalid, based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective voter registration of city council electors in the "exiles" of the voter registration in the constituencies.
Slvers Ēriks notes: "The court decision taken last year was ir trauksmes zvans.

Vandālvļu family is demolished Saltašas Kornvolas social maju and are left stranded on the streets.
Vandāļu's family was destroyed in the terrorist attacks on the neighbours, causing social damage of 50,000 marshals.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Šons Trebilkoks were not present on the property of Saltašā Kornvolā, and they filed several complaints.
When they were walking around the property, shocked housing officials found that the property had been completely demolished.
Grīdlvās un sienās bija vyṣisti holes, visur bija izmētāti waste un sienas bija noklātas ar graffiti.
The family now owns no property and a visticamāk lives in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, a caretaker for the Kornvolas Mājokļu service, was surprised that the housing would not be possible to restore.
She tells us that it was extremely difficult for people who lived here to be able to live.
In this case, several factors must be considered, and in the future the property will not have a good reputation.
This family is Slavic and their name is known.
I had three sons, who periodically stayed in the property of a police officer, and whose terror was sparked by violence, street gangs and baseball games, local mobbing, drug use, drug trafficking, and drug trafficking.
47-year-old Skeldonei, whose name has been Eigensums, in June piespriests sods by antisocial conduct.
Many of the demolished homes are now being left behind and waste is being collected.
Mālvjā, where previously possible, was a drug market, and also used several grids for the purpose of transporting drugs.
They regularly haunted the streets and constantly cheated on the police.
Kornvolas Mājokļu dienests were forced to leave the property on foot, when they had only 11 weeks, but no homes were taken out voluntarily.
The missing children were very happy with their disappearance, and their lives were absolute.
Vienslv said: "They didn't care about the citizens".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the bag was always a traki.
Neticlvami, how often we have seen the police here.
We didn't want to be a mess.
We were pamodāmies, and here we were just a little bit of a mess - we were not pieraduši!
Now, when they finally get to the prom, it's going to be amazing here.
Adams Fitzpatriks, who was the head of the Kornvolas Mājokļu service's neighbourhood protection, said his family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called by the police.
Mālvjas in the old garden was attracting various objects and small objects.
He also said: "It is very regrettable that the residents have not taken any responsibility for their performance, as the abandonment of the house is always the last resort, as Kornvolas Mājokļu dienests consider".
This was a very complicated situation, as their performance was extreme and the neighbors were very happy to enjoy their performance.
I appreciated the work that the visa mana team, the Devonas un Kornvolas police and community members, who were willing to cooperate with us, did in this case, to provide the necessary information.
Es cerlvu, if this event facilitates the life of the neighborhood, it will be shown, if the antisocial behavior is not acceptable.
Fitzpatriks said that the three sons of the visionary here lived in different periods of time, but the visionary is about 20 years old.

After the excavation, it became known that they were currently leasing some private property in Plimutā.
There were many houses with graffiti.
Police say they will continue to conduct illegal activities, in violation of their contracts.
Andjela Krova, police spokeswoman for Devonas un Kornvolas, points out that this breach is clearly a warning to other insurgents, who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who think that there will be no such thing as a free lunch".
Devonas un Kronvolas police force, even as it is considered a criminal un antisocial uzvedība, a police force will continue to work with our partners to protect local copyrights.
The opportunity to spend on economic growth is high.

The presidents who have passed away are Gustavam Zemgalam - 145.
On Thursday, 12 August, 145 years have passed since the birth of the Latvian President Gustavs Zemgals.
The Zemgals proclaimed the Latvian state, bet nepelnīti ir palicis widely described in the first Latvian president Jāņa Čakstes and the first-century period of the last president Kārļa Ulmaņa ēnā.
None of our nation's citizens have ever been so fiercely committed to democracy as the Zemgals, ten years ago in the famous book written by Arnold Auziņš, published by Gustavam Zemgalam.
Sarunā ar portal "Delfi" Auziņš emphasizes, that the Zemgals are coming to the networks of high-ranking politicians, who have been humorously outraged.
The others are the same, always very correct.
He taught that there should be no such thing, and today the same thing could be done to Raimonds Vējonis.
"There was a guy who was a big fan of the show", says Auziņš.
The politicians of the future have made history by taking the name of Karli Ulmani as their leader, betting whoever they are, how negants they have been.
The only person in the seats of the government, on whom he is not a client, was General Balodis.
Pat and bildēs he was irlv laipns un smaidīgs, naturally he was histērisks.
"Zemgals arlv their humor isjūtu un demokratiskumu represāj directly pretēju iespaidu", said Auziņš.
The Latvian University of Letters and Philosophy faculty professors Aivars Stranga discussed with "Delfi" the possibility of writing Auziņa to the assessment by Zemgalu as a measure of a no-confident national hero.
He also noted that the Zemgals excēlies ar ar ar dignumu pret minoritatēm, regularly summoning Jewish representatives to the presidential pillar.
"At that time it was not a common practice, but after the Zemgala presidency, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition", says the historian.
He was such a cluss a noslvvērts man, and the interest was to become the first president.
He pats after tā netieclvās, simply nealka slavas.
He also criticized himself, because he did not speak French, but felt that if he was president he should definitely speak.
"During the presidency, French was learned pamatus gan", explains Stranga.
Zemgals did not repeatedly get pierunāts candidat, to him tā īst augsti amati nemaz nepatika.
In this respect he was a very respectable person in Latvian history, even before the appointment of the president pilī was a serious amatā - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Similarly, Zemgals married Slaveno Zemgala kasi Suvorova ulice 3, where they found a krajamatnieku a krājaizdevēju association, in which the government practically negotiated the Latvian state.
He was always a progressive minded man.
Nebija is a great Ulmaņa centlvītājs, but publicly he is also nebilda.
"Privātās sarunās gan times and times, ka īsti Ulmanņa's actions are dismissive of him", Stranga points out.
He lived a life of peace, and had no conviction for wrongdoing or corruption.
What is the modern-day term for the Zemgalu?
He is, however, mostly associated with some of the leading figures in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, and he was a centrist.
"There was no satire or satire during his time, on the contrary, he could be associated with such as this to establish a stable presidency", Stranga summed up.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, the Latvian state visit to Sweden also took place, which in Latvia or during the netieši period meant the full recognition of the kaimiņvalstī and the integration of the democratic northern European nation in the family.
In 1929, on 28 May, Zemgals visited the country in Stockholm.
King Gustav V of Sweden's second visit to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian president was born in 1871, but died in January 1939.
Just do a few things to help your child cope with the pain.
Often, there are interactions that, in the child's mind, nevertheless appear to parents as something that is not normal.
When a child openly expresses his or her feelings - we know, how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
Specialist Mudina Uzlvelu has been criticized for these natural humanistic challenges - dusmām un niknumu, which every person periodically experiences.
Aggression - is a physical activity, as addressed to another person, usually manifesting itself, as a hostile act.
When we, adults, are angry, satrauki - usually we know, as we are going through a difficult time.
We can express, obscure, conceal, keep secret, tell stories to our friends or other teens, we can spend time in the kitchen, smoke cigarettes (that's the best way to do things), or eat a dog, eat a meal, or lose a meal.
We do not show our aggression to others, but we do in various ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are in a state of fear, they are not aware of what is happening to them, as they are being treated unfairly.
They were saying: "Ej promlv!", "Tu esi muļķis", "Sliktā mamma", "Neieredzu tebe", "Es ar tebe nedraudzēš" - a very reticent, when they could say: "Es uz uz tebe dusmojos".
Children live in a burt sense, they are fully located right here, at this moment, they spontaneously and patiently demonstrate their skills, and often also are in the midst of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid their child to show juxtapositions, including friendships, unknown to a child, but rather helpful to the child.
Do you need a break in a relationship?
It's a day when the world is not as it seems, or just as it seems - and there are so many reasons why we want to be "locked" in a moment, a day, or even a day.
Is it possible to get acquainted with a relationship in a moment and a little bit of a twist?
But does it also indicate that each partner saves the way?
In your opinion, there are different kinds of people.
Jānis (23) is a kodolīgs: "When in a relationship, and in a relationship, you need a break, then you don't have to be with the person".
Eduards (30) has discovered a pattern, a cure, perhaps, for someone to help.
And you know, when a partner starts to get nervous about each of his or her mistakes, then definitely - tas ir īstais brīdis, when he or she should be able to see the other ones, lai saprastu, vai tev hennes pietrūkst, vai especially for them nedomā vai pat at all negribas to see them anymore.
So the answer is yes, pausing to take time to understand how important it is to take time to take time to understand.
Kasparlvs (29) discovered his theory.
I think that in relationships, one must pause for one another every day, and at any time of the day, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, one must stride and avoid.
To cause a tas, to pamani every sīkumu, to otrs dara, to a tas sāk krist uz nerviem.
People start to feel anxious, especially when, and even more so when, because of what they have done in the past.
I have no personal experience in this area, so I have also endured a relationship for a few months.
And if you think about it for a moment, why did this woman, when you were together, go to the one who was asking for it, if you were having a little fun and a little sleep in the garden?
Doming is already a matter of life and death.
Jalv nav, tad nav.
"Man is, therefore a little bit noslvodu tos, kam nav". said Edmunds (46).
Kārlvlim (33) is a completely different opinion.
Manlv liekas, for everyone needs a moment of help.
You will never see each mirkli, vis-a-time, no morn till vakaram to look at the way you are seen, a lyksmot by nezudosošo love.
Attolvpies!
We have so much to do - friends, work, balls.
Visam and save time.
Of course, even the girlfriends will be seized, however, and if they want to know the balance between family life and the rest of the world, then they will be living forever.
That's all there is to it.
Mārtiņš (27) says: "It is difficult to say - to say whether or not, to take a break, but it is clear - it is difficult to say whether or not the proposer is in a relationship with the other, but it is not".
And this question is raised, then we will calculate, whether there will be any changes in the near future - on the left or the right, depending on the person.
I mean, while you're still young, you're always on the lookout for something - but, when you're serious, you're in a relationship that's at a whole new stage, and you're not really a person.
You guys are so excited to spend time together!
"Now you have to deal with another society once a day, and you need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need to be retired, then you will have to comment, then you will have to fight for the day when you need to fight", explains Kristaps (19).

Koļlvegova responded to no candidacy for the office of VID director.
Inga Koļlvegova, head of the State Revenue Service, has decided not to withdraw her candidacy as Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the LETA agency informed the Ministry of Finance.
Koļlvegova points out that the negotiations on her candidacy were conducted between the parties of the ruling coalition.

"Arīlv tas man nav pieņemams", emphasizes the former head of VID and the former candidate.
In the event that her candidacy was approved by the government, it is clear that if there were no convincing vote, she would not be allowed to work full-time and make the necessary changes to the VID, without government support.
Without such a perfect work would not be possible, says Koļegova.

He stressed that the project plan would be implemented within the project's vision and would be fully completed within the specified deadlines.
"To demonstrate to all those involved in the project implementation, including the EC, the VK and the stewards, that volunteering is the main goal and the main goal of the project, we have fully implemented all the VK recommendations regarding project management and supervisory issues", says Sanita Kaire, project manager at Krievu salli.
The project's goal-setting control and monitoring of existing long-term action plans were supplemented by the involvement of key planned activities, necessary decision-making deadlines, meetings with regular reference definitions, planned construction process monitoring instruments, and more importantly, threshold definitions.
The action plans approved for achieving the project goal by December 31, 2018, in line with the recommendations of the VK, were supplemented by monitoring activities and implementation, thereby strengthening the deadlines for checks on the other activities of the Pushes involved in the implementation of the project.
To improve project management and to mitigate potential risks, new project management plans are developed, defining project management areas and documentation, ensuring controls and supervisory mechanisms are implemented.
The project capacity building is designed to meet the project management structure, which reflects the planned project management team structure, staff qualifications and functions.
In order to develop the communication of the parties involved in the project, the project should develop communication plans, as well as the elements specified in the project action plan, define the project for successful completion of the stakeholders, principles of information exchange, and conduct a periodic discussion.
On the other hand, in order to improve financial spending and control, further details will need to be provided on the need to conclude a service contract or to start a procurement.

Vācu researchers discussed the number of "Berlīnes mūra upuru".
According to a new study, the number of deaths per communist party in the former Austrian border may be much higher than previously thought, but the number of deaths per communist party is still in decline.
According to data, on Wednesdays, the opening of the Berlin Wall Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, was marked by the arrival of a number of communist and communist forces in the western areas of the country, who arrested 1,841 people who tried to escape their controlled territory.
Museums and museums have been correcting the number of cases related to the robbery for years.
Šogadlv sarakstam added 11 more posts, including among the upuriem includedot also some six-year-old zēnu, kas noslīka, to his family trying to reach the West through the neighbouring Czechoslovakia un Hungary.
Starp the new Berliners murmured against the regime and also the Soviet army of deserters.
"The extent of the damage done by the double communism and socialism is not yet fully documented", acknowledges Aleksandra Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the capture of persons, the destruction of civilians, the preservation of communist-controlled countries, and the consolidation of the unity of the state", Hildebrantes emphasized in the statement.
But some researchers have already solved the new numbers.
"Skaitlis 1841 is not clear", says in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the Austrian historian expert Johens Štāts of the Berlin University of the Arts.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible mysterious deaths within the borders, but so far they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers had only tracked down 138 people in Berlin alone after the communist regime had seized them.
Given the number of people who have died, who have been killed, who have been killed in the Baltic Sea or who have reached the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State Department, the number of Ururu could reach about a thousand.
However, the number of Vienna residents is significantly lower than in 1841.
The reasons for the differing number of layers could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie museums also list all Australian border homicides regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
Museums also include a number of cases, including those related to the violence.
"If seniors between the ages of 70 and 80 years after the completion of border controls are not sirdstriekas", there must be these "slavkavniecnic boundaries" secam, Hildebrante believes.
However, the State is convinced that no-series should be made between the old people, who may have been displaced by their experience of being together, and who have been forced to wait long periods on the buses at the border.
Regardless of the age of the records, and the communist Austrian government's statistical data, researchers need to extract documents from various archives.
However, the State Group has recently released its new documents, and therefore it may soon come up with a new number of new applications.

Ponev gan couldn't explain why he was at the Olympics and won a coach accreditation, which, visticamāk, had to be given to Jakubovsky.
"Biju pieteikts kālv federācijas prezident ("team leader"), but for different reasons I have received the coach accreditation un tagad nekur netieku iekšā".
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available.
Until the last minute I thought about the Germans, who had no information.
According to the information available to LETA, a few days before Ribakova's start she had a saruna ac ac pret aci ar Poni and after her runner had been a asarām acīs, however, the LPF president pauda, so she was the only saruna ac desired by athletes before the start.

Rajevskis won, Kalv Kučinsky won, Reizniecei-Ozolai won in this ruling the approval of the VID leader and "first big decision", which could affect their future as politicians.
If the VID leader starts to change his or her mindset about the candidate he or she chooses, this will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The Cabinet next week will meet on the agenda and include a question on the VVD leaders Koļegovas' transfer from the VID to the Director-General's Office, the government's agenda shows.
Koļegovu VID heads were appointed by the then finance minister Reizniece-Ozola, after which, when no official management resigned, Ināra Pētersone un kad contested the VID's Director General but ended without a result.
VID leaders began an interview with the duty-bearer Dace Pelēkālv on Thursday, August 11, with Latvijas Radio pieļāva - and offered her to run for her favorite leaders, so she could be a Christian.

In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit threatens the inability to form a government.
A month earlier, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) adopted an opinion that Spain and Portugal had implemented sufficiently robust measures to reduce the budget deficit level to the eurozone's 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
Estimates show that despite the implementation of the fiscal measures, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while Spain's - 5.1%.
The European Commission, however, has decided to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while also maintaining its fiscal objectives for the foreseeable future.
Give reasons why the EClv has not yet imposed sanctions on these countries, and the growing Euroskepticism in many European Union countries.
The sanctions have only been used to expose such a negative attitude.
Critics point out that the EC's decisions were not consistent, but initially agreed upon by a single set of rules and then failed to apply them to life.
Thus, for example, the president of the German Bundesbank, Jenss Veidmanns, pointed out that Europe thus lost confidence in the interests of its citizens, in the rules and recommendations of the European Union, rather than in the seistoši.
Now the EC has proposed a visa for the Member States and approved the payment of the budget deficit by the end of this year to Portugal and by 2018 to Spain.
The European Commission alone will examine the progress made by both countries within a few months, while also indicating that Spain, Portugal and the United States should be ready to implement additional measures to combat poverty and improve conditions.
Initial forecasts suggest that Portugal's set goal could be achieved within the deadline and that this year the budget deficit could drop to 2.5% of GDP.
In other words, under the Stability Programme, this government should implement a reduction of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention paid to controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% in 2018 - to 2.2% in GDP.
Furthermore, consolidation measures should be implemented in the next two years at a rate of 0.5% of GDP.
Especially complicated in achieving this goal is the fact that, after eight months of negotiations between the Spanish political parties and the government, Spain is increasingly likely to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
But the societal domas aptaulvjas suggest that the third election policy in the country would have changed significantly.
The most popular party still remains the People's Party, led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, which won the election again with less than 33% of the vote.
Its popularity was somewhat diminished by socialists alone, while the popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Kopā mēs varam" or "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsoņi" was somewhat diminished.
Tautas wants to get the socialist Ciudadanos to take office this month, otherwise it will not be possible until October to adopt a proposal to submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval.
As announced by the representative of the Tautas Party's parliamentary faction, Rafaels Hernando, the authorities will not be able to establish a parliamentary election, however, the elections will be held for the third time, Spain will become a European refugee visa.
Pludmaļu tīrība Rīgas jūras līcī is criticized.
The activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of garbage dumps is increasing, and that most of the visitors are coming to peldvietu.
Vispiesārņotākās peldvietas and directly to Riga.
Galvasztas domēlvro, ka peldvietas ik dag tiekot sakoptas, but to fight against the unpolluted visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, sauszemē atstālv waste during the use of the product can get ice-cold, thus improving its quality.
Apart from the separatist places of Kurzemē, the beaches are not considered as a city in Latvia.
The same announcement was made this week by the Mana Sea campaign of volunteers.
Five years ago, activists concluded, the number of people leaving waste at sea increased by hundreds of meters.
Unfortunately, this year's event has been criticized for its ratings and setbacks.
"We see that, in the coming year, when the number of garbage on the beaches is 100 meters, it is likely that the number of garbage will exceed 200 units", said Jānis Ulme, representative of the Mana jūra expedition.
Latvian Radio sazvanīts, he foundās Tūjas pludmalē, where he continued his volunteer gajiens gar Rīgas mors līci.
Showed among different waste dumps a picnic left by activists and then left by daylight spuldzes, as left by sea smiltīs.
The organisers of the event, Ulme Teck, said that the pollution was caused by the residents.
"Galvenais avots are the very beach visitors, more than half of the total waste is plastic, various waste, starting with corn, plastic waste, as it is already in the end stage, because it is no longer possible to identify, un issmēķiem, pudelēm, korķiem", Ulme explains.
Starp on the cleanest beaches and also the peldvietas in Riga.
For example, Daugavpils is used to store almost 800 units of waste per meter, which is a critical amount.
Campaign organizers also clarified that they were not allowed to smoke, but also to issue a warning or a ban on the use of cigarettes.
"The living numbers for all the Riga peldvietām combined - Daugavpils, Vakarbuļlv un Vecāķiem - unfortunately sanāk lieli un tālu exceeds the desired goal, uz kuru it kā Latvija virzās, by 2020.gadam reduce the number of waste units to 135 units", said vides aizstāvis.
The cleaning of the peldvietu in Riga is not done every day, the summer heat is done twice, said the representative of the dome, Uģis Vidauskis.
However, the struggle against unpolluted visitors is quite fierce.
We are returning to this question of people's culture.
"Uz them, kaslv piemēslo, use alcohol, smoke un dara visas for things that you should not do, even special signs that do not work", Vidauskis points out.
Vidauskis therefore urges visitors to the peldvietu to report the pets to the police.
You should be able to suck the police, point out these violations and fight everyone in this way.
Perhaps there was a need for some kind of warning, but, as it turns out, ten or so things will radically change the situation.
"We should all just be patient with such offenders", he emphasizes.
Tikmēr water quality measurements were carried out for the fourth time by the Health Inspectorate, which had imposed a ban on official peldvietas.
Šogadlv gan, like other years, water quality it visur esot laba un apmierinoša.
At present, the situation is similar, with 56 peldvietas of water quality in the country at the same time and no water flow restrictions.
"We will take the analysis at the end of August for the last time", said Normunds Kadiķis, the inspection's senior health expert.
During the stiprulv lietusgāžu using sausage atstātie waste could get ieskaloti ūdenī.
This, in turn, can affect the quality of the product, according to experts.
The rotation of the Russian elite continues - the main leader in the Putin administration.
Patslv pameta amatu?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would be elected as the next president's special representative on matters of nature protection, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin spoke to Ivanov in front of the television camera with words of appreciation: "Dear Sergei Borisovič, we have worked together for many years and we have been successful".

Therefore, it is important to understand your desire to change the field of operations.
Unlv es ceru, ka kaṅgajā amatā you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, despite the selections, the impeachment of the president's administration was a very significant step that made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that elections to the State Duma are due in Russia, the baumas have been announced, that this solis is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanovs also had been suing Putin for possible vice president, so the allegations that he wanted to deploy the president's representative on matters of nature protection and transportation were dubious.
As the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs and the VDK un Federal Security Service general pulkvedis indicate.
Ivanovs have been a sense of unity with Russian President Vladimir Putin's allies.
He started his own gaitas specdienestos in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanovs became his deputy.
The first Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed by the secretary of the Russian Security Council during the presidency.
In 2000, after Putin's arrival, Ivanova's "Doctrine of Information Security" was approved, which included the introduction of a state censorship mechanism in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Russian Defense Minister, but in 2005, Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkova became the one responsible for the development of Russian defense industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after the head of the presidential administration was inaugurated, Ivanovs will also retain his seat in the Russian National Security Council, where he will also serve as head of the presidential administration Vaino.
Vainolv comes from the family of the Soviet Party elite.
The head of the presidential administration, Amatu Vaino, is recommended to pats Ivanovs.
We are acquainted with Antonu Eduardović.
Even then, in your marriage, we worked in government.
For the past almost five years we have sazināmies practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that after all the professional characteristics of a personal character he is capable of a hundred times", Ivanovs said.
Vaino came from no families, as belonged to the elite of the Soviet Party.
Her vectēvs Karls took an augustus amatus in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years until 1988.
Internet publications "Meduza" are a reference to the book "Igaunijas pašnoteikovanje un nezavisnost" raksta, in which Karls Vaino esot lūdzis Maskavu dot permission pielietot fuerza pret demonstration participants at the end of the 80s.
However, he was able to withdraw and soon lost his love.
Afterwards Vaino and I moved to live with Maskavu.
Antons Vaino is a graduate of the International Relations Institute in Moscow, which manages the Japanese language.
However, he left the diplomatic service to work for the President in managing protocols.
It has been reported that in recent weeks Russia has satirized several top-ranking officials for the removal of a pat aresti, including the appointment of several deputy governors and federal representatives.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin has overhauled the elite's position ahead of the upcoming 2018 elections.
Vienna has no main features - increasingly leading amateurs and power structures representatives.

He is not a workaholic.
Artūram Nikiforenko's tasks were even more complex, with experience becoming more respectable.
Iznākums is similar, kaut uz tatami he noturējās teju pusthiru minut more than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately, the Latvian Jews are the most lacking in ambition.
The federation's leadership was led by Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial scholar Vladimirs Šestakovs, and Latvian embraced Aleksandrs Jackevičs, no longer the "Golden Score", a judo development rit on the lejupslīdošu līkni.
Jackevičam, as here consultē Kazahstānas džudistus, un Vsevoldam Zeļonijam mantiniekus and others.
Betlv, ja neaudzinās, also will not be.
The United States is a federal prerogative.
Therefore, like no galactic quotes "Rīta panorāmā" scanned the pledge of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to Rio to win medals.
The people are not real.
The night was marked by a lack of attention and a waiting list for beach volleyball matches with Samoilovs/Šmēdiņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga kā jau "nāves" group - the losers are in the final game.
The Latvian duet was a very successful one - it could also lose, but only by four points.
Saspringlvumu even increased in the previous game.
Neviens negribēja smrt - this sajūta virs vēlv vējainā short of a visa for the duration of the match.
The players were presented with additional complications.
Initially, like Taslv, we could be our - as well as our - allies.
Betlv was a hit.
Pretlv Latvijas duetu to play here was quite easy.
Serve the Samoilov un gaidi, when he plīsīsīs.
Pret Kanādu ieplīsa, pret Kubu saplīsa first set at the end of a third at the beginning, and slodze bija ne pa jokam.
Šmēlvdiņš at that time could make, and the work was maz, bet, kad bija, paveica to godam.
The Brazilian Samoilovs ar Šmēdiņu were able to win the two sets, the first one took the bet at 16:15, however at 16 they also won, and they also beat the losing limit.
Bet could also lose the match 0:2, with the second set deficit being -4, however, thanks to the wind, they managed to win.
The third already had been arrested by Evandru servju zīmē.
The next chain - the one that does not eat the serve, the second piece of the pie and the other side of the dish - is too much ticklam un Samoilovam, which is a completely different resultant of the use of the recipe.
There was a certain Szeš Samoilovs on the court, but this time he was more successful, and the loss of Szeš Novelt would be unprofessional.
Krelvilis also made a mistake, a bit symbolically, in the last block of trieca bumbu he himself.
Zaudēlv is the commander.
This time, there are definitely also actions - in the third set, Evandru almost slipped out of the box, but the bomb nevertheless broke the line.
The divisions were next to the line.
The video of the strident episodes was also made by the pretiniek.
In the first two games Evandru was very active, but in our games they were very productive.
They were all in a losing streak together on the table.
Now we need to gently identify the causes of the accident.
Perhaps we should have lived next door to my stadium instead of meeting a delegation to the Olympics.
On the way, he paid divarpus for hours.
Perhaps a little self-confidence in the seven-episode series.
Perhaps Klaugenfurtēlv should not have played, but quicker you get here and better acclimatize.
Perhaps it was a mistake to attract sportswear.
We wait for a question more than an answer.
Our bikes are playing games.
Saplvnis by medals beidzies.
What's next?
There are also a few World Cup tournaments including Jūrmalas "Masters".
In the life of Šmēdiņš ar Samoilov, there were never friends like this, and they had too different personalities.
Bet you'll need it too.
Kad ir sabrucis sapnis for Olympic medals, var rasties doma also for divorce, and vaina tiks look for not only sevī, but also partnerī.
The decisions are difficult, but it is much harder in Latvia to find a worthy partner.
Both brothers play biču, but Jānis ar Tomu have already tried to break through, while Mihails Samoilovs are still too young to start climbing the world's tops.
There was a chance to try Haraldu Reglvžu, Aleksandru Soloveju, Edgaru Toču, the returns of Mārtiņu Pļaviņa, but there will be no more than this variant, as sevi ne vienreiz vien confirmed the World Cup posmos.
Kopakabanas smiled at them this time and again.
Unlv is a win.
Of course, one should also take into account the fact that as beach volleyball becomes more popular, new pairs, a mere retajam augums and less than two meters are added.
They still deny success, bet on the essential arguments in the fight for victory.
The most important are Nepali garaks.
Sportsmen, journalists and the opportunity to meet at the venues offered by the game organisers, as well as choose their own.
The USA Basketball Association is based on cruise ships, part of which are Nepalese Olympic tennis players.
Also, some volleyball beaches have built the Kopakabanā Hotel.
This time, journalists offered to offer a whole host of petty nightclubs with a strongly overplayed scene.
Therefore, also choose krita uzlv apartment īri.
The risks are, and sometimes they are, not from a logistical standpoint.
This time, he risks attaisnojas.
Kopā ar Vladimiru Vladimiroviči are hiring an apartment at the border of Kopakabanas un Ipanemas.
Pludmale at a distance of 200 meters, often arenas pusstundas gajienā.
Rajlvons gana segurs, jo favelas patalu, however you must not lose your temper too.
Vladimirovich's team was immediately impressed by the fact that the most professional sports journalists were trained by Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Izskatās, on Friday morning there were more medals of sapnis.
In the 100 metres barrier run at the highest altitude, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa broke her own personal record.
I'm sure they're still disciplined.
After a 10-year break, "Porgijs un Besa" was performed in Liepāja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgijs un Blvesa" had its first performance at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
The international recognition of the artworks has been repeatedly extended to the U.S.

The opera "Porgijs un Blvesa" is told in a musical language, telling stories about love, its impassivity, its chaos, as well as the sadīves tragedies of a simple everyday experience.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythms.
This is the political correction in this opera, this tolerance is excluded from the standpoint of the time.
"Unlv ja, this milasstāsts ir incredibly powerful, incredibly skaists un kaut somehow really deep", says directors Viesturs Kairišs.
Taslv, as one likes most, - clauses or recitals of this opera, always there are such pieturas points - slavenās melodijas, slavenie motifs, but these transitions do not have one character to another, exgaismojot one character or another character, vai kori, vai orestries.
"As the most pleasant, this life", the opera evaluē operas "Porgijs un Besa" the musical director of the concert study un diriģents Andris Poga.
Opera visitors are willing to attend, and there are many great events.
We will have a great prieks, as we will hear the world's most famous Slavonic Gēršvina opera.
In fact, there are only a handful of worlds in Liepaja.
"A professional performance", the opera was appreciated by the guest of Edgars Lāms.

Riga vice-president Andris Ameriks Rozentāla at the opening of the jubilee exhibition pointed out that the address of the museum itself could in the future be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Jaņa Rozentāla laukums 1.
Museum director Māra Lāce atzina, said that the re-registration addresses radīs krietnu bureaucratic slang, however, overall this idea is appreciated and therefore supported by the municipality's proposal.
Riga city is a kind of foundation for this idea and was founded in 1936 by Burkarda Dzeņa pieminekli Janim Rozentālam, who stands at the foot of the museum.
Vilhelms Purvītis, the then director of the museum, was the only one to initiate the creation of this monument.
In this way, this remote operation could be purely logical.
Mani ganlv visu visu vrem mazliet grauž svednje - bet Vilhelms Purvītis, where we his word liksim?!
"But, you American kungs, excuse yourself for thinking"... said Lāce.

Snapchat's "Anime" effect is criticized for its charismatic appeal.
Snapchat representatives, therefore, have filtered the animation, but some commentators claim it is racist.
The powerful effect of Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to alter the reality of a game in a completely absurd way.
You have various feelings transformed by ananāsu, suni vai tēlu, as in every other Roja Lihštenšteina gleznā.
Lēcas ir miglaini, the image of the instrument, generates more than 30 million transformed selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public knowledge.
Snapchat's effects have been criticized in the past, receiving overwhelming criticism, as the app popularized too much mellow or light skin tone as an ideal beauty standard.
This week, new effects were published, which allow users to create a split acis, a split zobus, a split vaigus, and some critics noted the racist animation dzelteno ģīmi.
Likewise, the question of whether such pretrunas or livery can lead to greater problems for companies and diversity.
A public denial report was issued Wednesday, when the issue of The Verge reported that the effects of the new technology were not being applied.
The company has been paskaidroja, as its purpose is to portray anime telus, rather than caricature people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Citilv categorically denies the similarity to Anime.
Korean-American art student Greisas Sparapanilv tweeted images of her recordings that resonated with the audience.E-mail from her notes that the effects were "aizvainojoši un neērti, lai neteiktu more".
Her piebilda, which is difficult to remember, is a striking resemblance between aziātu karikatūrām un lēcu efektiem.
Taslv suggests that if the effects of the drug are simply zeltena, bet zeltena is in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is the only company that is dedicated to these cultural issues.
American culture is also involved in the ultimate struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood-style devices, which are used daily.
Snapchat has a large youth audience, as it represents different races, unlike older residents, and is more attractive to such things.
Snapchat is not creating images, as it would be for users, since "today such things happen", Thursday in an interview with 25-year-old Keitija Žoulv.
On Thursday, product manager of the company lvMedium Žou published his Snapchat app un ieteica other actions in the same way.
In her article in a telephone interview with the media, she explains, in her opinion, the issues related to race arising from Snapchat's employment policies, as well as the fact that it supports racial diversity.
Žoulv criticized the company's marriage, which consisted mainly of ir baltie men and then closed its blog and reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"In this sense, if there is a racial diversity in the company, then such decisions are made; there are some representatives of other races working in the company, but they do not take such an initiative so that they can safely express their opinion", says Chinese-American Zou.
Viņa's opinion was also expressed, while Snapchat responded to her complaint.
Undertakings are not public, and employees represent different races, indices, and tas ir privāts enterprise.
Snapchat did not discuss the origins of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company had no specialist personnel who would concentrate on it, so that the company would also represent racial minorities, which are widely represented and will promote inclusion in the company.
Žoulv, however, did not update his Snapchat account, adding: "Interestingly, do they really need more users like us, let alone know, if we're doing the right thing".
Congress has announced that the military has approved the report by the Islamic State.
In a statement released Thursday, the House of Representatives said that representatives of the US Central Intelligence Agency had sanctioned the report, portraying the country as a rival to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria more optimistically than it actually was.
The Central Intelligence Agency analysts noted the general inadequacy of the briefing by the Bruņoto Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Finance Subcommittee of the Republican Representative's task force, stating that their conduct controlled the reporting by American achievements in the fight against Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampā, Florida, responsible for overseeing US military operations in the Far East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report, the news report, confirmed by the top Centcom executives, reflects the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it actually does, and the facts are regularly updated, reflecting better performance than the analysis of the report.
California Republican Rep. Klvens Kalverts says, "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our actions are untenable, and our policy makers receive a report that is untenable".
Centcom management errors are often sought in the highest levels of organizations.
These 10 reports detail even existing problems in the Central Intelligence Agency's analysis by the US intelligence agency for Iraq in 2014.
Lai gan tas does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration would have been willing to accept the report, however tas indicate that Centcom vadība ir has put some pressure on analytical images showing an optimistic view of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) radicalised draudiem.
In a report, it was noted that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration's press release, the Notice of a Report to Congress, portrayed the situation significantly more positively than it actually was.
For example, Centlvcom representatives publicly announced that the operation to recover Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, which is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas Republican Party representative Maiks Pompeo said in his report: "A few months of investigation has not clearly established this".
No. 2014 to mid-2015, the report of the US Central Administration's chief officials, which depicted the Islamic State threat Irākā vājākus, was more than what it actually was.
The Republican Party has set up a working group, the uzzinot, to analyze and analyze information about the Islamic State and its sanctions.
In order to investigate the allegations, a report published on Thursday found new findings in this case.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence conducts an investigation into the activities of Centcom and its activities.
The Democratic Party's Intelligence Management Committee on Thursday published its own report, in which it agreed with the conclusions of some Republican Party working groups.
Democratic Representative Adams B. Šifs said in his report that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom overly restricted the preparation of its intelligence assessment report in connection with ISIS and the Iraq Security Speech.
Shifa kunglvs plainly, that this process "captured the spread of information", rendered analytical work ethics un "unstable facts unplayable to the truth".
Bet Šifs un Demokratlv party biedri piebilda, including evidence that the Baltic Nams had put pressure on the Centcom analytiķiem to produce a report, in accordance with "pre-determined or political norms".
The Daily Beast published the provisional results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon deputy lieutenant commander Patriks Evans announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
As he puts it, as experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, a Defense Ministry and intelligence agency are calling for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation does not focus solely on the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq un Syria was successful (apgalvojums, which increasingly targeted representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year's accusations were not enough, and President Obama was completely unconvinced by reports from the Central Administration about military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places.
Criticism of the Islamic State spyware recalls more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregorijs Hūkers published a study, claiming that the George V. Bush administration had begun the Afghan war, asking too much about the possible searches.
Hūklvers also played a significant role in uncovering the Islamic State spy issues.
Last year, officials reported that the Hūkera command had discovered, in a press release, that the rise of the Islamic State oil refineries had significantly impaired the financial status of the terrorist group, which had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the discovery had not taken place outside the Central Administration.
At that time Centcom commander General Loids Ostins III received criticism, which many lawmakers considered too positive, for reports describing the situation.
In April, General Ostlvins resigned and was succeeded by General Joseph L. Votels.

The first-place winner will avoid a confrontation with the strong Dutch Icelanders, as well as the other group leader.
Despite the unchanged six-day game, the Americans already had a surprise victory, four years ago in London, taking last place among 12 teams.

Her net worth at the 2008 Summer Olympics, joining the team in the final.
But 2012 was not a good year for her and her team.
The following year, the England national team coached by Kregs Parhams won the match on both fours.
Bama is described as "culture, mentality and physical change".
In London we did not borrow as much work as we do now.
We have completely changed the way we look.
In the fourth game, Bama revealed the result, scoring a goal in the first half and extending the distance.
India started the game without a win on their own, but their standings were very poor and they scored a minimal score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly took the field.
She introduced the puppy pretinches to the area on the left-hand side of the field, then managed to get to the middle of the field on a racing ball pretinches vārtos, starting the American 2:0 in the wild.
In the middle of the fourteenth period, Melisa Gonzalesa found the veenus vārtus.
This was the first U.S. Open Cup game, with each of the first three games being decided by a penalty shoot-out.
Her eyes are full of fear.

"Mums are going very well right now", said Pahams, but the game will be on Saturday.
The most nomācoššest ēdiens of the Depression period were the "Sātīgā maltīte".
In March 1933, shortly after the election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he sat in the oval office, leaving the Maltese.
Presidentam Rūzveltam garšoja such smalkas kulinarie delikateses kālv zosu aknu pastēte jeb fuagrā un Merilendas bruņurupuču soup.
But on that day her maltīte was creatively more peticīgīg: full-bodied tomato sauce, potatoes biezputra un desertā - plūmju pudiņš.
"The way we showed solidarity in cooking with people was very tasty", says Jalvina Ziegelmane.
Andrjū Koulv, the Vietnamese author, said: "This is also a message to Americans that they should eat".
Pālvris no Brooklyn Heights region and food historians.
In his last book, "Dārzeņu Sautējums", he described Chinese virtue in America, while in his book "97 Ābeles" Ziegelmane described life through the food īres namā Manhetenas austrumu lejasdaļā.
Viņu jaunalv is the author's only work, "Sātīgā maltīte", published by Harper's, and his stories about American food during the Great Depression.
Known for their cooking solidarity, they worked together to create a sandwich shop called "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple restaurant in Flatironas, which operated during the Great Depression.
54 years old Ziegelmanes kundze ordered sviestmaizi ar kausēto sieru un sakapātām olivim, while 57 years old Koucais ordered tītaru, potato biezputru and vegetable salads.
Kad reportereris ordered a few shots, a couple of atzina, to her choice of very suitable sarunai for the meal.
Ziegelmanes kundze told me, that the viltotais zaķis were very popular.
He was the pastor of the earthly heritage of zaķis, aknu zaķis un pupiņu zaķis.
Tielv was also voted the main ingredient among other ingredients, which enriched the maltīti.
Iedomājies, kālv tas ir - apēst so many earthly things, that there would be no food in the place.
The newly formed Koulv kungs.
"Droši vien likās, ka vēders ir pilns ar svinu", he said.
In the years before the Depression, American afternoon food was similar to field food, especially rural regions.
Sievietes gatavoja ēst their husbands-strādniekiem un brokastīs, in the afternoon a vakariņas tika pasniegti svaigi pagatavoti sacepumi.
During World War I, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans. "Sātīgā maltīte" is described as the American adaptation to the conditions, when America suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
"Tolaik ēdiens became the everyday object of American folk's galvanic expertise", Koulv kungs, a paskaidrojot, tells the story, "why he and her sieva wanted to write directly on this subject.
Typically new budget diets became important: such essential edibles as viltotais zaķis un sautements became idukdienu, sautements were "lielisks as a way to use overpalikumus", noted Ziegelmanes kundze, since pavāri could hide the unhealthy ingredients of zem kremešní measures.
Svalvigos augļus are replaced by lettti žāvētie augļi.
Garlic, which for many years was a staple of American Maltese, has now become an extremely luxurious gem.
At one time, when the number of calories in a food was higher, the nutritional value was higher for the young, young, and even the newly formed.
In the book of Ziegelmanes kundze atrada recepti, as well as the pagatavot or earthwork, the sviestu pildītus sīpolus.
Koulv kungs adds: "This was not a popular afternoon galda supplement".
Ziegelmanes kundze stresses: "This was very surreal".
Zemeslvriekstu sviests a cepts sīpols nav simply.
Many homemade recipes are applied to the gritty season.
There was a household economist, Luīze Stenlija, director of the Federal Bureau of Economic Affairs for Housing from 1923 to 1943, who noted a national eating paradigm, which had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing rakstus un recept newspaperstos un magazines, they encourage households to become "economists" and to accept such challenges as turning macaroni into a burkanu mixli garšīgā maltītē.
"Sātīgā Maltīte" is a historical gardumu mielasts.
Particularly interested are the government's attitude towards its outcast citizens, for example, President Herberta Hūvera's "let man eat cake" attitude.
In public, he told of his simple childhood as a foodie, Aiova, in fact he ate the smallest millionaire he had become.
Koulv kungs relates: "He has a European virtue, such as zivs ar gurkuši.
He ate almost apzeltītā viesistabā, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely out of touch with reality.
President Rūzvelts would have made the same mistake, and his mistress Eleonora would not have advised him to set an example for his eating paradigms.
The book tells of how the Rūzvelts and the housemates, who learned to eat, and the Baltic Nams became places "where not only were pasniegts come to the most visited places in Washington, but also visliktāk paid to the most popular places".
As soon as the national economy recovered, most of the depressions and culinary trends paralyzed.
But we will continue to focus on calories and nutritional value, as well as, as pielietot sciencie culinaria, piebilda Ziegelmanes kundze.
Pālvris tells us that, as they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of Ziegelmanes kundzes' mother's eating paradigms, such as why she was unable to digest food.
"Viņa patiesi was soaking up the food", said Kou kungs.
Ziegelmanes kundze said: "Viņa actually tracked people".

It contains a powdered cream, only dried plums, a little milti, sugar, water and canēlis.
The vision carefully absorbed the brown carrot masā, as it was found on the lips.

Gilead will be reimbursed for legal costs in the fight against Merck's Hepatitis C invention.
The court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. had the right to recover legal expenses incurred in the Hepatitis C patent infringement case against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead filed a lawsuit for 200 million marcs of soda money for two Merck patent infringements, which were banned in connection with the successful Sovaldi un Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judiciary found violations of Merk's business, such as soliciting after giving a citation for unethical conduct.
In a hearing on Thursday, US District Judge Bets Labsons Frīmens pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses, as there are arguments in this case.
Merck is trying to gain a market position in the pre-Gilead market, as it dominates the market and the hepatitis C virus, as it is effective in 90% of cases of acne.
The litigation was initiated in 2013, when Gilead and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other, attempting to acquire ownership of the active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient in Gilead's drug.

The British coach only looked after Skineru, who showed him his potential, as he later proved.
Hindus, Kenyans - champions, who four years ago started together with Hoju un Skiners, who set an Olympic qualifying record, but the race starts were the New Zealand team.
However, the britu trio won the zelta medals.
After the Indian's apple-seed was cut off from the Indian, the Kenians rose up in the wilderness and the Skiners took the bait and carried it.
The strategy of the Indian army played a major role in the victory, and the Indians needed a greater victory, so that Kenya, and especially the Sikhs, could emerge faster.
Hojs sacīkstes was watched by the BBC representative on a skater, Kenya and India skating at the moment they were skating on a good pedestral.
A 23-year-old Gālvzgovietis said, "This was an unmistakable pagodinājums".

Over the past three months we have become a well-known command.
We've lost so many World Championships, so the last Olympics was really special.

Given the achievements and team progress over the past five months, the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya's result, he could really repeat Hoja's success, winning three Olympic silver medals.
Kenya tas meant six gold medals won by one individual, and also by the Kenyan national team on March 23 (izskatās, ka tas ir britu svētais datums, ja on this day also ir dzimuši Stīvs Regreivs, Mo Farahs un Rodžers Banisters).

The best teams in the tour are always the best.
I'm going to win together with my teammates.
"Just be honest, we're going to win one and win a little bit".
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should wear a bruninieku".
It was the only medal fight that day, but it wasn't the only news story for Britain.

Portland's future causes became unclear, and the contract was terminated.
Aluminio has made a number of unfortunate mistakes regarding the future of its employees in Portland, Victoria, and its main customer energy company has announced a breakdown of its cooperation.
This announcement was based on the government's plans to stop subsidizing the energy company, which is vital so that the company can continue its work.
The 20 year-old subsidies will be discontinued in November.
Up to now, more than 2,000 Portlandas Alkoas factories have been subjected to workplace risk.
Threatened could be up to 2,000 jobs.
In addition, there will also be unprecedented blackouts, which will cause the country to consume about 10 percent of its electricity without a visa.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry cause system, as the noveda pie Angleseas power station ceased operations.

The agreement has a 12-month term, so it will be valid until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts in the 2017 fiscal year as well", a company representative said.
Starting in fiscal 2018, the potential impact of the fiscal year on profits limits favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that, according to its forecasts and calculations of losses of $187 million, it anticipates that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoalv, with the decision to terminate the contract, will not be able to continue the operation of the causeetavas or supply or energy.

Analysts and analysts are puzzled by the possible closure of Portland's steel mills in Victoria, the closure of Tomago's nearby factories in Newcastle, and the sector's poor economy.
Last week, CEO Steven Mikelsons said that, according to analytical reports, 600 megawatts of power was consumed during the Portlenda bridge and 900 megawatts of power was consumed during the Tomago bridge.
If these factories were not in the energy market, the demand for energy would have decreased significantly.

The Community Legal Centre receives 160,000 visitors each year.
Four years ago, more than 160,000 people's demands were met, and even the budget was cut, and the situation could be worse.
There are three types of people in Kvīlvnslendā - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, the labour force, upuri un tie, where there is no money, to fight illegal extortion, and to refuse free legal aid to a representative office.
The Community legal centre, which is already overlooking the financial crisis, warns that the situation will only get worse.
As of next June, these legal centers will receive 30% more funding than before.
The director of the Queensland Legal Centre, James Farels, said in the latest reports from the National Legal Centre Association that legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people where needed.
Mistrlvs Farels pointed out, and this decision was not taken, that the situation would only get worse.
He also said: "The Queensland Legal Centre is continuously receiving insufficient funding, in other words, to help and deny assistance to thousands of people, where needed".
People who try to end violent relationships, people who are in a crazy paradise, families who are going through a divorce, workers, even unkind atlaiž - all these people have legal problems and these reports indicate that they are not getting the help they need.
From June 2017 to June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more Queenslanders will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Queensland, Senator George Brandisu, to immediately halt the funding cut so that people, wherever they need legal assistance, can obtain it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to bring the level of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to focus on the needs of local councils and their clients and the Palazčuka government to invest in this important area.

Britain is going to win the Olympic Games and will be be playing Hītrova.
Hīlvtrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions in London, but also throughout the country.
I think that Padara Hītrovu is very pious, just as in 2012 in London, where we invested a lot of work, so that the national regions would be the winners of the Olympic Games.
Stratforda un Īstendalv has gained an incredible amount of money in the Olympics.
We will pave the way again, providing local residents with a business and business opportunity through Hītrovas.
We have created 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally added a spot of youth unemployment in the Hītrovas area.
As at the London 2012 Olympics, there will be people who will consider the challenge to expand Hītrovas to be too big and too ambitious.
People said that if Britain never did the preparations for the Olympics, it would be a world-class event.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and in the case of Hītrovas, they would not be right.
There are always obstacles, but it must be overcome, and Hītrova has overcome them.
As with the Olympics, Hītrova and infrastructure projects, no kura labumu gūs visa society, not individual individuals.
The expansion is likely to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, job growth, and experience across the UK.
Hītrovā works with a great team, which has implemented an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion marts, including a budget starting with terminal 5, as well as five years of work, and a terminal 2 between two of the world's most heavily used terminals.
Now they are planning to set up a third shelter, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion marcs.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I'm sure that will be the case with Hītrovas' expansion.
It is time to expand the Olympic Walls, ensuring our trading future with a radot of new jobs, and Britain could be a great place to live.

In the LTV raid "4.lvstudija" directed by Dmitrijs Saidjaševs, kura kaimiņš requires a capital repair in his apartment, un since then Dmitrijam no griestiem drūp apmetums un nav convènības, to stay in the apartment and be safe.
The problem is that the man's house is being built in a poorly maintained apartment and is being destroyed.
Tadlv is informed by Rīgas būvvaldi, our manager and dating organization.
Būvlvvalde said, since we are not some kind of operational services, we have no expertise.
"I own a house and I'm a member of the Latvian Engineers' Union, and there will be experts", Dmitrijs says.
Pieaivictaitai expert ieradies, fixed notikušo un opinis, to the pārsegums being in an insatiable state.
But since Dmitry's first submission to the construction ministry went viral, and until earlier this week no one was able to answer, or stay in an apartment with a life-threatening condition.
Būvvaldē said - such legislation, such gaidiet, and such are not satisfied, write it down to everyone in turn.
"I wrote to Riga's house, but they sent our manager to us, then our manager again to us, un tad ir strupceļš", says Dmitrijs.
After the papīru kalvudzes examination of visas cleared, the construction work was suspended, and the matter was heard at a later time.
Within two months, an expert examination will be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment, who is conducting the remodeling, will have to correct the defects.
Neatkaris expert opinion has been developed, but the construction industry considers it to be incomplete and a virspusēju.
Experts have indicated that the metallic material in this new construction is not safe, until the owner of the apartment is convinced that the lower level is in danger.
"That is why we have requested additional explanations from this expert", explains Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga city council.
Despite the ban on carrying out any remodeling in the upper apartment, no turienes aizvien heardams, and construction continued.
Sods for arbitrary construction without construction permits are not 70 to 700 euros, but in this particular case sods could be a very expensive bargain.
Kamērlv are awaited expert opinions, the construction authorities have taken the decision that apartments should not be used for the purpose of construction, apartments of Dmitrija.
"It is not a practical occurrence that in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have posed a danger not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which the owner is unable to exploit his property", explains a representative of the construction authority.
Now Dmitryjam is going to look for a place to live - a radio station, a friendship center, a hotel or even rent an apartment.
Betlv losses were very heavy, and the censuses were not carried out in a civic manner, as they would take a very long time.
Due to the unusual construction, it is currently prohibited to stay in apartments until the building is completed, and the wait time is three weeks.
The losses of the rental will be repaid to the owner of the apartment, in which the remodeling will take place.
The owner of this apartment therefore, taking into account the conditions of the construction, also prohibits imprisonment for a period of up to six months.

Makartnijs: The presence of Joko Ono endangered "The Beatles".
Pols Makartnijs has said that the presence of Joko Ono has raised the sensation of the legendary group The Beatles being in danger.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "last" relationship with fellow rapper Jonah Lennon, but during the time when her band was recording in the studio, Makartniju offered her a job, and Ono was the only female member of the group - Džordža Harisona, Ringo Stāra, Lenona un Makartnija - among them.
When asked about his relationship with Abu, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine: "Tās ir patiesi labaslv".
We are the most endangered of the jutāmies.
We recorded it while she was sitting at the amplifiers.
Most of the group was the most peaceful.
We tried, but not quite successfully, and we were very disappointed.
We were sexist, but girls usually didn't get to the recording studio, and they let us do jobs.
Kad Jones started satictions with Joko, she didn't sit on the control panel, but rather in the middle of the four of us.
The "Yellow Submarine" authors also acknowledged that the band, now regularly signed to the band's former band, Ringo, occasionally approved recordings from the studio "Apple" darba planous, but otherwise "The Beatles" and "beiguši darboties".

NASA climate modelis: Venus was once a living planet.
In addition to NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a living planet.
Scientists at NASA's Godarda Institute for Space Research have developed models to study the history of Venus using a rigid algorithm, which is also used by climate scientists.
Models were developed, to be determined, or on Venus, whose atmosphere is almost entirely carbon-free, whose atmosphere was once similar to that of Earth.
Scientists have already explored the mines in advance, as the velocities of Venus's gravity can be explained by the atmosphere.
But recent simulations suggest that since Venus was once flat, Zemei has an atmosphere similar to that of a gray planet.
Modelis also explores the Venetian agrēlvras topography.
The planets used to be more saous than the Earth, but there was enough water and geographic diversity on them to allow life to flourish.
Agrīnās Venēras laikos Saul was 30 percent more spožžak.
In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus's appearance in the model reveals, on a daily basis, a bright part of it for up to 2 months, a press release from GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio.
This process causes the planet to be silted up, while the other forms slāns, which act as lietussargs, passing through the planet no Saules karstuma.
The result is a measured climate temperature, which is actually a much higher temperature than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution, which was developed by scientists in their own hypotheses.
Although it was once alive, over several billion years, Venus has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Their oceans are bursting, and they are still emitting old ultraviolet radiation.
When completely exhausted, only the flat carbon dioxide left the atmosphere and the greenhouse gases that it produces - Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patriks Rojs atlvkāpjas no "Avalanche" coach started
On Wednesday, Colorado "Avalanche" coaches of a hockey operation Vice President Patriks Rojs presented his insight, as a reason, and the impact of the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakiks confirmed this message to the media, and the clubs immediately began looking for new coaches.
"Over the past three years, I have been energetic, diligent and purposefully fulfilling my duties as head coach and Colorado club hockey operations vice president", 50-year-old Royce said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how to improve team performance, but not the necessary effort to achieve higher levels of results.
To achieve this, the head coach of a hockey operation, Vice President of Vision, must fully sanctify the organization's vision.
They should also be able to influence decisions regarding team performance.
At present, these conditions are met.
Saklviks, who hired Roju on May 23, 2013, thanked Rojam for his contribution to the team.
Saklviks said that Patriks informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate the fact that he has given his life for the good of the organization and we want to see him continue to do so.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-14, Rojs was recognized as the league's best coach and received the Jeka Adamsa Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and a first place finish in the Central Division, and the Colorado team beat the Minnesota Hockey League in the first round of the playoffs.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with a 39-39-4 record, a pivotal point behind the Wild teams, and were not able to win another special conference.
The Rovs have won four Stanley Cups in their career - two against the Montreal Canadiens and two against the Avalanche.
The workers of the North Jurassic oil platforms are on strike for the destruction of waste.
The strike was carried out by workers of the Northern Jurassian oil platform, and the parties involved in the strike resumed the strike, the leaders of the strike said.
Periodically, the oil processing company Wood Group organised strikes on North Korean oil platforms, where the company Royal Dutch Shell operates.
In the joint statement, the aim is to ensure that the Wood Group, a joint venture, a joint venture, and a joint venture are committed to securing the benefits of the strike.
Several full-day meetings are planned over the course of each week, starting early next week with the aim of reviewing problematic issues.
Arodbiedrības pavēstīja, in their next measures, as organized after more than 25 years of pause, and aimed at a planned wage reduction of 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced the wages of workers in Northern Ireland by 9 percent this year.
In 2014, the company reduced the wages of workers in the land by 10 percent.
The company is clear that additional wage cuts will allow the company to overcome market upsets.
Shell has already cut wages to several thousand people and announced plans to halt oil and gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work, in preparation for a major merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the rise in oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to withdraw from the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish Parliament MP Deivs Andersons met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North-Jurassic strike plan.
He said that Northern Iowa is a vital economic region.
In his report, he made clear that the North requires an economy as a whole, not a vision of its own, rather than individual needs.
In 2016, the new Northern Jurassic projects are expected to invest nearly $1.4 billion, compared with $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Keplers measured the rate of star fading in the Plejada star.
The Jaunākā Keplera telescope mission helped astronomers to compile a detailed catalogue by the speed of star movement in the Plejādes star system.
The data from this study helps astronomers understand why stars in this star are moving at different speeds, as well as how the speed of star movement can be attributed to planetary formation.
"Most recently, by comparing our results with other stars, we have obtained more information about the relationship between the masses of stars, the size and the history of their solar system", said Luisa Rebula, a scientist at the Pasadenas Caltech Infrared Processes Center.
The Plejadas' star system is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in this star cluster are just beginning to rise, reaching a length of about 125 million years.
They are moving at their maximum speed.
Rising at their maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
The stars are attracted to the magnetic field of the stars, which in turn brakes the stars.
Zvaigznēm novecojot, to grešanās velocities decreasās.
Keplers measure the rate of star movement and the time between the atpazinamu stars, such as the plankumu saules, appearing.
Catalogs of the fastest stars in the universe show that larger stars are slowly bursting than smaller ones.
Rebels compare stars with dejoots, and larger auguma makers perform piruetes less than male auguma makers.
Rebels tell us, in Plejadas "ballet" views, that the more rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster-rotating objects are very massive stars.
In addition, the Plejādes's starry area is located in the tik tuvu, tas kalpo kā the great cosmological laboratory, where we can compare the characteristics of stars and the velocities of their rise.
Rebels tell us that Plejadas' stars help to develop theoretical models for the rotation of stars in two directions, the older and the younger.
We still have a lot to learn, and we know why the acceleration rates of the stars are slowing down.
Rebuls and his colleagues have presented in detail the analysis of the speed of the Plejadas stars' drift in three new publications, which will soon be published in Astronomijas Žurnal.
