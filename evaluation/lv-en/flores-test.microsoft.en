While a single experimental vaccine proves capable of reducing mortality from Ebola, so far no drug has clearly proven that it can cure an existing infection.
One antibody cocktail "ZMapp" initially seemed like a promising solution to the problem, but official studies have shown that it has a lower effect on the prevention of mortality than thought.
In the PALM study, ZMapp was a control tool, meaning the scientists used it as an initial indicator and compared three other types of therapies with this agent.
The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the Olympic family's absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's assertion that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sports, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes to our organization rather than discontinuing certification.
The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports an independent investigation that can uncover how the scale of Larry Nassar's abuses, so boldly described by the victims, could have been uncovered for so long and embraced all necessary and appropriate changes.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, this theory was already widespread, but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
. Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown at the top, and carotenoid-colored on the underside.
This find also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stem called a barrel, but there are other characteristics inherent in feathers, namely rays and rays, then the researchers came to the conclusion that the barrel most likely arose in a later phase of evolutionary development than these properties.
The structure of feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers pointed out that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows the plumage of adult birds, not the fluff of the baby.
The researchers suggested that although this is a new dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not baby fluff.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it was discovered that the functioning of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
Radiant power and rotation are used together to determine the figure of the star Rosby, which is associated with the plasma flux.
The smaller Rosby's number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team could be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon acts on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way acts on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is formed from many small particles.

In the daytime they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night warmer.
Their thermal operational properties are not as persistent as those of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glenn Cushing of the Astrology Task Force of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Northern Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, a lot of technology has never been used in elections: voters enter the booth, put the printed sheet with the desired candidate in the envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs in the voting register.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can certify that they do not contain any envelopes at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes other than those of properly registered and authorized voters are attached.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count their votes under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Public Prosecution Director Keir Starmer (QC - The Queen's Lawyer) issued a statement this morning announcing the initiation of a case against Hoons and Price.
Hoon has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by MP Ed Davey. Mp Norman Lemb is expected to receive the position of business minister, where Davey previously worked.
Hoon and Price are due to appear at the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
The fatalities were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Kudebak. The driver was Kudebak.
Edgar Vegilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider needed facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's weapon fired inaccurately as he aimed at the fifth man's head. Schneider has persistent pain, blindness of one eye, missing part of the skull and his face restored from titanium.
Schneider relayed the testimony via a video link from the USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual championship races.
In her first slalom race, she did not finish in the first race. 36 of the 116 rivals got the same result in this race.
In other races, namely the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's race with a total run time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-place winner Austrian Claudia Loesh and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place winner Giongi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's races did not finish their runs, and 45 of all 117 skiers did not rank in the rating table.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Aria said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss and also recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are referred to as Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when a car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Pagett Hospital in Greityarmouth.
He was then transferred to Adebruck Hospital in Cambridge.
Adecoy has since been imprisoned by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting the filing of the indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony is likely to be invalid because her picture has been widely published.
It's a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's justice system works differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes, "Journalists seem to be walking on thin ice, publishing photos of suspects and other information."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for the charges, has told reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is made.
According to the leak, the document will cite a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants, based on the border situation before the 1967 Middle East war.
Topics such as the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley were also reportedly discussed.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after signing the treaty, but the PI agrees to such presence only for five years.
The rangers had to carefully guide the shooters who participated in an additional trial of pest control, since this trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
As part of the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW) and the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program, qualified volunteers were recruited.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and cultural heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive safety briefing and training.
Martelli took the oath yesterday from the new Interim Election Council (CEP), which has nine members.
It's Marteli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission urged an earlier resignation from CEP as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martellly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to hold elections, some since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating of the device have been recorded, resulting in a total of six fires in which four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says it is aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company has called "minor."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really deplorable."
The earthquake hit Marian at 6:30 p.m. 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 weapon.
To date, several hostages have been released, but at least six have been confirmed to have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were quickly released.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly lady, because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Ligin followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital.
When he worked in the hospital, in his free time, Ligin began to study preterm labor.
His studies have shown that after the introduction of the hormone, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua agency reported that on Wednesday, government investigators had recovered two "black boxes" — flight data recorders.
Luna was also respected by other wrestlers who were her associates.
Tommy Dymer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night two Moons were seen. Pretty unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dastin Rannell, known as "Goldust," commented that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even weirder... love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place now."
Of the 1400 residents polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia's transformation as a republic had risen by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julie Gillarde argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This is the view of 34% of survey respondents who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The conflicting results of the poll show that 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays, but his preparedness is being questioned due to his complaints.
He was not allowed to take medications to relieve pain, as they are painkillers prohibited in these games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has unveiled the largest known pre-numeral to date on Jan. 25.
By early February, the discovery was verified by several people using various hardware and software and was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that it is comets that have brought water to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, in particular—how Earth has formed, since comet collisions with Earth occurred a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo began his career as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
Assumptions are being made that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow the plane to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than older ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to determine the location of pilots with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional vehicles are planned, surface trains at Wembley Stadium will not stop, but parking and park-and-ride" facilities will not be available at this location.
Fears about the lack of transportation increased the chances that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that the new species originated in only two generations, although it was believed that such a process would take much longer, given the reproduction between the endemic Darwinian finch (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be poured into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled out even into very tiny shapes.
It can be stretched in the form of a small wire that can be bent and twisted. It can be forged or form sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books called "illumined manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how chemical the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (letter H in the compound pH) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons separated by electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture of the hands will react with the outer layers, which will create a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harapa and Mohenzhodaro, almost every house had a watercourse toilet, which was tied to a complex sewer system.
The remains of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the cities of Minoan (Crete) and the island of Santorini (Greece).
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women walked together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who is several thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
In space, the satellite receives a call, and then almost instantly reflects it back.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket with a height of more than 100 feet is required.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it provides us with a much easier and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars and many other vehicles.
After that, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat much more of the wide variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche - a special task that each cat performs and that does not allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats that live in large groups called burrows.
The flock consists of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Flocks of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs—the behavior of these two animals is strikingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats) — and are just as deadly to their victims.
The athletic tiger is able to crawl (although not very well), swim, make long jumps and pull with five times more strength than a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus of panthers) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion's full voice, but rather like a sentence of growling, shouted words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If there is an opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals hunted by ocelots are much smaller than their own.
Scientists think that ocelots track down and find animals to eat (game) by smell, tracing them left on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with the ability to see night vision and also move very stealthily. Oceloti hunts their prey, merging with the surroundings, then rushing on top of the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they move along a mountain range or river or move to a new island so that they cannot move back so easily), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they should have been before.
The initial population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less similar to the rest of the population.
After all, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not be able to be called a single species.
We call this process speciation, which only means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe but absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants take their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mozazaurus was the largest predator in its time, so there was nothing to be afraid of, except for other mozazauras.
More than 70 very sharp teeth were located in its long jaws, complemented by additional teeth in the palate of the mouth, and therefore no one who got in its path had a chance to escape.
We don't know exactly, but it probably had a fork-like tongue. In its diet were turtles, large fish, other mosaics, and it was perhaps even a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that went into the water; for a huge dinosaur like T. rex wouldn't deal with it.
Although most Roman dishes would be familiar to us, however, they also had some strange and unusual festive food, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and rodents, called susurs.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate while sitting in chairs, while rich men liked to hold joint banquets, in which they slept on their side while eating.
In the dishes of the ancient Romans, products brought to Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries were not used.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, moreover, no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the abode of god.
People brought offerings to the gods, but priests tried to indulge the needs of the gods by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard of the temple and then an inner sanctuary, into which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temple, special pyramidal towers were built, which were called zikurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the near East, the house was not so important.
The Jewish family mostly lived outdoors.
The women cooked food in the yard; The shops were simple open counters facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large forests on the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The sagas of the ancient Scandinavians say that Eric Rudais was exiled from Iceland for the murder and, going further west, discovered a land named Greenland.
But despite his discovery, at that moment the Eskimos tribes were already living there.
Although each was a "Scandinavian" country, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have watched the film "National Treasures", you can consider that the treasure map was drawn on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the following words: "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document turned upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293/4 x 241/2 inches) was rolled up and deposited shortly after it was made.
So that note is most likely added simply as a label.
The origins of the D-day and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was managed by "Vichy France". It was the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of going to war with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a special culture formed by an extremely large group of people who live and work in cooperation with each other, namely society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil, associated with the Latin "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means city or city-state, and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. The culture of civilization implies the transfer of knowledge to several generations, a lasting cultural influence and its smooth spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind essential historical evidence, and they are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the War of the Revolution, thirteen states, on the basis of Confederate statutes, for the first time formed a weak central government, the only component of which was Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state institutions, which were often unwilling to cooperate, hoping that they would enforce all the laws it passed.
It also did not have the power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The unanimous consent of all states was required for the articles to be amended, but the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, which has also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 auto racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in both the international and Olympic Games.
Japan is made up of almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshū), ranking Japan 7th among the world's largest islands.
Due to the fact that the territory of Japan includes several islands, from a geographical point of view it is often called the "archipelago"
Taiwan's beginning was in the 15th century, where passing European sailors write down the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa", or a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, embarking on a transformation of the local population's cereal-growing practices and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qin dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and announced the incorporation of Taiwan as a province into the Qin Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qin dynasty signed the Shimoneseki Treaty, by which it transferred sovereign power over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely Intiuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings built at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally originated.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common size of photographic film in the era of analog photographic film.
It is still in production, but more importantly, its image proportions are now used in digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many commonly accepted formats (such as the APS set of formats) correspond to or are very similar to these aspect ratios of the image.
The much-distorted and often ridiculed law of third parts is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining the order of the image.
It is indicated there that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts both vertically and horizontally (see an example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and influential, came under the magnifying glass.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the countries of Europe, despite the different languages and traditions.
Its all-encompassing power affected absolutely everyone, from the royal to the ordinary population.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's money is there for that purpose.
The central power of the church in Rome has existed for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was observed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a blockade of the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters so that ships could not enter the entire part of the ocean, which threatened even neutral ships.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestrained submarine hostilities.
In the 1920s, the majority of the population and nations considered pacifism and isolation to be paramount.
After the horrors and atrocities of the war experienced in the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to start working for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different periods of time; every stage of China's development, or every family in power, was a different dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The best-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Yin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce struggle for the throne took place among many nobles.
The three-state stage was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, thousands of people died fighting for the most important place in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, all male applicants could apply for positions, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military sphere, since now the ranks of the army were assigned on the basis of human qualities, and not on the basis of belonging to a certain order.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed people of the working class of other countries to begin their revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in transcendental questions. He often went to the cave that became known as Hira's Cave on Nora's (light) mountain to indulge in contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the twists and turns of the ages, vividly demonstrates Muhammad's penchant for spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all, even if someone knew it existed. Once in the cave, complete isolation sets in.
Nothing more than a clear, beautiful sky overhead and many mountains all around is visible. From the inside of the cave, nothing much of the outside world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC. BC, is one of the many structures of huge pyramids, which was built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
arc up the sign looks like V and "arc down" looks like a clamp or square that lacks the bottom edge.
Up means you need to start from the spike and push the arc, down means you should start at the handle (the place where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward movement of the fold usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement is stronger and more convincing.
You can highlight your marks, but remember that printed marks are indicated for the sake of good music sound, so they should usually be followed.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris on October 6, 1789, due to a crowd of market wives from Versailles.
In a carriage, surrounded by a crowd, they headed back to Paris, with people shouting threats to the king and queen.
A crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage wide.
At one point, a gang member waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The expenses of the war of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and interest on bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the windfall profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basic income of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the environment that prompted the creation of the Order.
The era when events took place is usually called the Middle Ages - the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Before the Middle Ages, there were early Middle Ages, and after the Middle Ages was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas, from the advancement of technology or technological imperative to the firm understanding that the fate of a person is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, two main ideas are distinguished: the development of technology itself takes place largely outside of cultural or political influence, and technology itself creates an "impact" on societies, and this influence is consequential, not socially conditional.
For example, one could say that the car certainly contributes to the development of roads.
However, the country's road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs associated with using the car.
A large number of private cars also means a higher number of accidents, as a result of which new methods of repairing damage to bodies are invented in health care.
Romanticism largely possessed cultural determinism, which stemmed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time, culture and customs related to the geographical region in question arose, which were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, since they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris today is considered the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was also considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as the center of luxury goods, starting around 400 AD and ending with about 1100.
Its status became less significant in the 12th century, as the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than those available in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that Constantinople lost the name of the fashion capital, but Paris acquired it.
The Gothic style gained popularity in the 10th–11th centuries. and later in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly influenced by the culture of the Byzantines living in the East.
However, due to slow channels of communication, fashion in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developmental achievements of that time was that as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out in order to grow enough food and to meet only the needs of the farmer(s) and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds harvested in an ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yields.
Historically, most peasants were engaged in self-consumption agriculture, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may vary in age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of participants.
The characteristics that define the subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Representatives of the subculture often emphasize their belonging through a different and symbolic style, including fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common techniques used to illustrate the importance of socialization are examples of unfortunate cases of children for whom their parents did not provide socialization due to neglect, difficulty or intentional malice during their growing up.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been constrained by humans (usually their parents); In some cases, the abandonment of this child occurred due to the rejection by the parents of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorders.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; Some say they have lived in the wild alone.
Fully growing up with animals, a wild child is characterized by almost the same behavior (with physical limitations) as the animal in question that cares for him, such as fear or indifference to people.
Project-based learning should make the training process easier and more interesting, but basing it is a step forward.
The supportive approach is not a method of learning, but rather as a means of support for people who are learning something new, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Supporting can happen both virtually and in reality, in other words, as a support, a teacher can be, but so can the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and is meant to ask, say in front of you, and explain procedures that might be difficult for a student to solve on their own.
Children are referred to foster care for a wide variety of reasons, including carelessness, violence and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving and educational, yet it does.
We believe the foster care system is a safety zone for these children.
Our system, which involves raising foreign children in the family, must provide safe housing, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
Foster families must provide everything they needed in the homes they were previously removed from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet create additional dimensions in terms of application and satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Studying the audience's response to websites, Immy and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video footage has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions - facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that a person can determine whether someone is lying by correctly understanding the microexpressions of the face.
Oliver Sachs in his essay "The President's Speech" showed how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to determine exactly how true it is.
He even speculates that animals, such as domestic dogs, can also have such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Studies of the twentieth century have shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and pronounced.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the set of pronounced variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shift variations back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to provide the necessary amino acids with the plant resources available in the savannah.
In addition, it can have serious consequences: increased growth, malnutrition and even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins available in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
While food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, ber also provides a lot of protein containing essential amino acids.
Given all this, it would be no wonder that our ancestors also solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to what chimpanzees living in the savannah are currently doing.
Sleep interruption is the process of making a targeted awakening during normal sleep, falling asleep again after a short while (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock so that you are at consciousness, but not completely awakened.
If you switch the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythm is to drink plenty of fluids before going to bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic action) to make you get up and go urinate.
The amount of inner peace of a person is the opposite of the amount of tension in the human body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that interferes with the achievement of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the path of mahayana love and many Indian yoga methods.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. This includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-encompassing love.
During the practice of kundalini yoga, the energy of Kundalini (transfiguration) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, so cooperation was established between the USSR and the USA. As the war ended, these countries became hostile again due to different systems, processes and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was destined to last for the next 40 years and, using intermediate armies, real hostilities were carried out on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish guards had already been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and re-organize along the Romanian placard.
However, these plans became morally obsolete almost during the day, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union arrived and formed the Belarusian-Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods remains the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods while disrupting the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was 2. World War II's North Atlantic Campaign. The Americans tried to transport men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded in this, Germany would most likely have conquered Britain like all other European countries.
Goats were most likely domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagrros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient peoples and tribes began to breed them, because in this way milk, wool, meat and skins could be easily obtained.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that wandered through the hills and other grazing areas and were looked after by goat shepherds, who were often children or adults, much like the more well-known shepherds. These methods of grazing are used up to this point.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse railway consisted only of wooden planks placed in parallel, they allowed the towing horses to reach higher speeds and tow larger loads than along the wrinkled roads of that time.
Sleepers began to be used from the very beginning, so that the rails do not move. But gradually realized that the rails would be even more effective if they had a metal strip at the top.
It became a common practice, but iron led to greater wear of the wooden wheels of wagons.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known way of moving was walking, people began to walk upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning a standing person).
Their ancestors, the australopiteks, did not go upright as usual.
Two-legged specimens were already found in fossils of the australopitic supergenus that lived 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although representatives of the Sachalanthropic genus probably walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and even be activists to some extent alleviate the suffering of the future.
In many cases, it is like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the roots of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological achievements of mankind, and the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft document signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, which was located a couple of blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "Dunlap broadsides" (Declaration of Independence).
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Palace on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he read it to his army in New York. One copy reached London on 10 August.
25 The "Dunlap broadsides", which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original, handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives even now. We call them birds.
Many people do not perceive them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and know how to fly.
But birds still have many characteristics that resemble a dinosaur.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on both of their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or in computer language – bits.
Internal poisoning may go unnoticed immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough not to immediately establish a diagnosis.
The most definite sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medicines or toxic tanks of household chemicals.
Read on the label the first aid instructions for a particular poison.
The term "beetle" for this group of insects is used by entomologists in a formal sense.
This term originates from an ancient association with bed bugs, who are very adaptive to parasitize on humans.
Both robber bugs and bloodsuckers are parasitizing pests that have adapted to life in foci or sucked on other bodies.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis have been recorded, making it the most common neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their own or their child's best interests.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents are terminated parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main goal of science is, using the scientific method, to understand how the world works. In fact, this method is the driving force behind most scientific research.
There is also experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and observing can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinion was recognized in all matters of science, including psychology.
As fewer and fewer people knew Greek, Western countries were separated from their Greek philosophy and scientific roots.
The presence of endogenous cycles and the process of their formation, taking into account the biological clock, often has a decisive influence on many of the observed rhythms in psychology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, are approved for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely even without external triggers.
The Hershia and Chase experiment was one of the leading propositions that DNA is genetic material.
Hersey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, noting either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the unit of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are stem cell line cells.
In children, only mutations in stem cell line cells can be transmitted, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism connects people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
In these places, you can engage, for example, in hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, or visit parks and study information about the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to the island of Borneo to take photos and get to know the orangutans.
Every morning, people from small rural towns go to their jobs by car, while others come to their place, whose workplace is in the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is connected in some way and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Now scientists point to the fact that an economy with such a massive carbon emission has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and participates in transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear about similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do such complaints arise about transport systems, why do problems arise in them every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is the root of the problem deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their possible interaction.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult, because with one hundred percent confidence it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior most often has a fairly consistent range, so traffic flows can be determined with some consistency and can be roughly calculated mathematically.
To better reflect traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design and processes of roadway infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to rise into the air. Their ability to fly helped to more easily avoid enemies, as well as to find food and a partner more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they are able to fold their wings to the back, clinging them to the body along the entire length.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot unfold their wings are variegated dragonflies and one-winged dragonflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were of the opposite opinion: that the solar system orbits the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places six miles wide.
From the Amazon flows 20% of the volume of water flowing into the oceans from all the rivers of the world.
The main Amazon is 6387 km (3980 miles). It extracts water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stones continued until the very end of the existence of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza, by their size and excellent technical performance of the construction, remained unsurpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New State admired the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the least population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also an everyday language used by most workers in this country, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known such basic chemical elements as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, since they are all found in nature in the open air and are relatively easy to dig up with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle expressed the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more certain elements. These elements were earth, water, air and fire.
It was more reminiscent of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also expressed the theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys, in principle, are a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
There may also be such alloys that have in their composition a small amount of non-metallic elements, for example, carbon.
In the universe, everything consists of matter. All matter is formed from tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that a single point at the end of this sentence would consist of trillions of atoms.
Thus, when the pencil arose, it was a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the status of the pencil decreased, and it began to be used less often.
Now people write messages on a computer screen, and there is not the slightest need for a sharpener.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when some newer invention appears.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, like rolling heavy chariots on a hill. By splitting the core again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and this means that they tend to share a little encouragement, or simply like that.
The surface of the moon is formed by stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust on the nearest side is about 70 km thick, and on the far side - 100 km thick.
It is thinner under the basalt plain and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more lunar seas, since the crust is thinner. It was easier for Lava to rise to the surface.
The basis of content theory is to find out what inspires people or what attracts them.
These theories propose that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized when they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
As a rule, managers who begin to lead their former colleagues may show two types of behavior. At one end of the spectrum is an effort to maintain the status of "yours."
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibility and bringing people to justice.
At the other end of the scale, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she needs to change absolutely everything that the team has done so far and turn it into his achievement.
After all, the leader is fully responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often leads to discord between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual teammates often act as a touchpoint for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local leadership might not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible command" (page 109, a book by Larson and LaFasto, published in 1989) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the participants reports. The invisible team sets standards for each participant.
Why would an organization want to invest time in such a time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? One of the reasons why concepts of learning in an organization are put into practice is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be revealed.
As a result, the process by which the organization works in unison to overcome an obstacle can contribute to the creation of a new, innovative process to meet the needs of the client.
Before an organization turns to innovation, leaders need to build a culture of innovation, as well as an organization in which knowledge is shared and in which continuous learning takes place.
Eingel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher-level results.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognition abilities. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more accurate.
Scientists in their research are supported by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It provides us with a lot of information and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes occurring in our mind.
Although artificial intelligence is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important direction in computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of technology.
AI research forces machines to automate tasks that require programmable action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and make diagnoses, as well as recognize handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate industries that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and is built into several home computer and video game software applications.
The study tour forms a large part of the learning process. Often, the teacher would be happy to take students to places where they cannot get by bus.
The technology offers a solution with virtual study tours. Schoolchildren, sitting with classmates, can look at museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or admire beautiful art.
Virtual sharing of a study tour is a great way to discuss your trip and share your experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their tour of the state capital and every year that website is redesigned, but previous versions are saved online as a history album.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although often at first, when students start blogging, they do not pay attention to grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical target audience, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to explore the world around them more broadly." The need to maintain reader interest motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a technique that encourages collaboration and stimulates students to learn outside of school as well.
Appropriate use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and think critically. Through the active use of materials available on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of the content written by others, as well as express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while in the north you can enjoy the untouched natural beauty of Muscoka and much more.
All this and much more forgives Ontario what others consider to be the real Canada.
Vast areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and in some places there are almost uninhabited wild areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: The number of African-Americans living in the U.S. is much higher than the Canadian population.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is arguably the largest, and when it comes to wildlife, it is like a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are affiliated with France, as well as known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam into the lands - in the Comoros and Mayotte this happened on a large scale.
European influence and colonization date back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered a route from Europe to India along the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, this region borders the Sahel region, and in the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All traveling women are advised to say that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to pull out a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, situations may arise that they may consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for a woman to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Do not be afraid to refuse men and reject their attention (it does not matter whether they are cultural differences or not, this is unacceptable anyway).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name of Kasabranka in order to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city into Dara l-Badija, and the Spanish merchants who established trade bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping places in all of Morocco.
In the old town of Medina, you can easily find places where Moroccan traditional products such as tajins, ceramic dishes, leather goods, hookahs and all sorts of trinkets are sold, but all this is for tourists only.
Goma is a popular city of the Democratic Republic of Congo, popular with tourists, located on the very eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Njiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in its center.
While Goma is safe enough, all visits outside Goma should be reviewed to understand the current state of the fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Niragongo volcano along some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking sites in Africa.
To move around the Goma, you can use the "boda-boda" (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congo francs.
Due to the fact that it is relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor used to designate exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist-attracting attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sands, it was included in the list of endangered World Heritage Monuments.
This was one of the main stops where Henry Louis Gates' PBS documentary "Wonders of the African World" was shot.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which maintains different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most significant of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It might also be beneficial to buy a "Wild Card", which provides access to certain parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is named after Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider the main one.
The overall picture of the buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is likened to a shimmering band chart, which is clearly demonstrated by the presence of Victorian port waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, head off the island to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely compressed on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is a place that British colonizers took over as their own, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbani is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching from the coast for 80 km (50 miles) in the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbani has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on the territory of India is called Sundarbani National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining groves of mighty jungles that once covered the Gandjetika Plain.
Sundarbani covers an area of 3850 km², of which about one third is covered by water/marsh area.
Since 1966, Sanderban has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer on its territory.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, but most, especially on the eastward and Jakar/Bumtanga routes, depart between noon and 5 p.m. 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Co-driving taxis offer a quick and convenient way to go to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums of Bhutan) and Punakhu (200 ngultrums of Bhutan).
The Ojapoka River Bridge is a vanshu bridge. It stretches over the Ojapoca River to connect the city of Oijapoca in Brazil and St. George de Lojapoca in French Guiana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters, and have two strips 3.50 m wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, for traffic it was opened only in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guarani was the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who were also engaged in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as guaikuru and pajaga, which feed from hunting, foraging, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Huge Province of India", originated in the 16th century. as a result of the interaction of the Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its local character and identity.
Argentina is known for one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo courts of Las Kanjitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here several other times a year.
For information on tournaments and places where you can buy tickets to polo games, visit the website of the association "Asociacion Argentina de Polo".
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP), the value of which is set equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the "FIC West Store" store.
Usually, islands accept British pounds anywhere, while Stanley often also accepts credit cards and US dollars.
In the distant islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although the currency of Great Britain and the United States may be accepted; Ask the owners in advance to find out the acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to spot the Falklands Islands currency outside the island territory, so swap money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, there summer is when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical belt; during the summer months, temperatures usually exceed the +30 °C mark.
Winter can be insidiously dreary: the temperature rarely drops below the freezing limit, but if there is wind and humidity at the same time, it seems colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain throughout the year is approximately the same.
Although many park animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park's supervisory authorities, a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, as well as a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife must be observed!
No matter how submissive they look, bison, moose, North American moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, ferocious and can also be dangerous, so it's better to keep away from them piece by piece.
In addition, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep the camp clean.
Apiya is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island, and its population reaches only less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the notorious site of the 1889 sea deadlock, when seven ships from Germany, the USA and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank except the British cruise ship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
In the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city center turned into the killing of the supreme ruler Tupua Tamaseses Lealofi III.
Thanks to Auckland's two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular are located in three territories.
The beaches of the North Coast (in the northern province of Harbor) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most of the shade is provided by pohutukava trees.
Tamakidraiva beaches are located in the port of Vaitemata, in the exclusive suburbs of Mishonbei and St. Heljers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops located on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a beer of pronounced taste, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local cave is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'coffee with milk' is alien. Black coffee is called 'espresso', cappuccino is made with a huge pile of whipped cream (not milk mousse) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Reef rides are held year-round, but injuries are rare in the reef for these reasons.
However, listen to the recommendations of the authorities, take into account all the signs and carefully follow the safety warnings.
Kubomedusas appear near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the northern part of the city of 1770. Sometimes they are also found at other times.
Sharks are common, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not common ocean dwellers; their main place of distribution is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that when they arrive at their destination, they will have a place to sleep.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although through a travel agent you have the option to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save you a reservation if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
But any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most visitors choose to live in tents, and most of them see this as an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the epicenter of events, you need to arrive early to find a tent place that is close to music.
Do not forget: even if the music on the main stages has already ceased to sound, there may be places at the festival where music will continue to be played until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic in winter, check the location of the hut, because crossing the ice makes a rather terrible noise for those most affected by this activity.
St. Petersburg cruise ships provide time for sightseeing the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (find out the rules).
Casinos usually do their best to keep their visitors as long as possible and to make them spend more money. As a rule, there are no windows and watches in the casino premises, and it is also sometimes difficult to find a way out.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and stay indoors.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the expense of the institution. But drinking alcohol weakens judgments, and every good gambler knows the importance of keeping a clear mind.
Anyone who is going to drive in polar areas or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or chilling temperatures.
There is little friction on icy and snowy roadways, so you can't drive like you do on clean asphalt.
In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time, which can create a traffic jam.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow, blizzards, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, so traffic runs mostly without interruption throughout the year.
Safari trips are perhaps the biggest attraction for tourists in Africa and the brightest adventure of many visitors.
