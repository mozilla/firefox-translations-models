A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim&#39;s brother says he can&#39;t think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother, noting that: &quot;His life finally started to improve.&quot;
The body found Wednesday outside a Westfield supermarket has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the San Francisco Medical Examiner&#39;s Office said.
San Francisco police said his death has been ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim&#39;s brother, Luis Galicia, tells San Francisco ABC station KGO that Frank previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he landed his dream job at the Sons &amp; Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant &quot;Sons &amp; Daughters&quot; informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
&quot;We are a small team that works as a close-knit family and we will miss him very much,&quot; said the representative.
Our thoughts are with Frank&#39;s friends and family during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia says that at first Frank stayed in hostels, but recently life has finally improved.
&quot;He moved into a new apartment and met a girl,&quot; Louis tells radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia claims he doesn&#39;t know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
&quot;He always pampered his family by cooking a delicious meal and preparing lunch,&quot; said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in arguments.
He was the brother who adjusted to the others.
&quot;With everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a diamond in the rough that shone brightly every day,&quot; he says.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the SFPD Information Line at 415-575-4444.
Young doctors&#39; strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors demand their union to start protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (MAA) Young Doctors Committee (JAK) is set to ask the council to support wider protests in early September.
JAK believes that the ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract proposed by the LMA.
58% of all members who participated in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK councilor Elena McCourt says the government continues to remain silent on the matter and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: &quot;With this in mind, the JAK vote has resulted in a total rejection of the contract offer and a decision to request new formal talks to discuss the key issues.&quot;
In response to the government&#39;s silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA board to authorize the development of new contracts to take effect in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors participated in six strikes, including the first stoppage in the history of the NHS.
After the vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA and recommended by the BMA, the representative of the young doctors of the LMA, Dr. Johan Malawana.
Before meeting the 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the contract would be signed with Medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of Outcasts?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader in the St. Petersburg Palace, it seemed that Ankara needs this partnership more.
However, the two shook hands.
Vladimir Putin&#39;s smile looked artificial and did not evoke warm emotions, even given his usual restraint.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Putin his &quot;dear friend&quot; at least five times, according to a review of the meeting.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm causes mixed feelings.
But the coolness radiating from Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the downing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offense was even more painful considering that it came from a friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be very difficult, maybe even impossible.
Since November, the public position of Russia has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television broadcast aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were accusations that Erdogan&#39;s own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
Ankara&#39;s gain from the peace settlement is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after last month&#39;s failed coup attempt to oust him.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
So are economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused serious damage, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually ensures the influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe a sigh of relief when regular flights are restored.
They look forward to holiday fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the state TV predicts a decrease in the prices of fruits and vegetables, as the import of Turkish fruits and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: &quot;Tourists for them, tomatoes for us.&quot;
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow&#39;s side.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition to everything, one can also see the dissatisfaction with the protracted negotiations on joining the EU and the intervention of Putin, who likes to take advantage of the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly scored bonus points in Ankara&#39;s eyes by voicing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, as it itself has a deep-rooted fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, held at this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey a chance to present what one analyst called an &quot;alliance of the outcasts,&quot; two countries that feel ostracized by the West joining forces.
But despite the publicly displayed unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreement concerns Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
After more than three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents said at a news conference that they had not discussed the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Turkish president purposefully avoided questions about the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find common ground on the Syrian issue.
But after months of openly hostile relations and a potential disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
The SKB brand will have a supporting role in the future, the bank&#39;s CEO announced.
Outside of Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross McEwan tells the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank&#39;s global ambitions.
It has given up on those ambitions since the bank nearly went bankrupt eight years ago and needed a bailout.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided to bring other national brands to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all references to SKB, outside of the head office and official stock exchange listing, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private finance brands such as Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond, and Holt&#39;s Military Bank will now also gain prominence.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of Invernessshire with customers and staff.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;SKB will become the brand for our investors and the one our people work with as we become more of a brand bank.&quot;
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the &quot;Six Nations&quot; and will involve different brands in sports sponsorship.
&quot;The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?&quot; says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical for us to say we were going to be a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But through hard work and focusing on our customers&#39; needs rather than our own, we&#39;ve obviously made a big difference.
We can bring these brands back to life, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Dettori scores 3,000th win with first place at Newmarket with Predilection
Dettori uncorks the champagne for his 3,000th win with two first-place finishes at Newmarket.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Dettori claimed his 3,000th win in British history with a first-place finish at Newmarket.
He achieved this with a second win in the race, held in his home town, riding Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in a horse sprint.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pete Edery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won with Ghayyar, said: &quot;It&#39;s something special.&quot;
I am very touched because my family is here.
I am very happy that it happened in Newmarket because I have lived here for 30 years.
It&#39;s not a big race, it&#39;s not Royal Ascot, it&#39;s a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After winning, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in steeplechase racing, champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who set several records during his career with more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggott, a nine-time Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of today and it&#39;s no surprise that he has achieved success that few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his sense of tactics sets him apart from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have won 6,000 if he didn&#39;t just do the weekends and the big races.
But in all seriousness, it&#39;s a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning UK races for 30 years.
He is lively, which is great for British racing, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Dettori celebrated this achievement with his trademark flying jump.
From wind speed finishes to flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
It has been an adventurous journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 &quot;Great Seven&quot; at Ascot, and survived a plane crash and disqualification for drug use.
He struggled to return from a six-month ban three years ago, but showed his strength of character to defy those who doubted him by returning to his best form.
And he could be racing for a while longer - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least the age of 50.
Russian President Putin fires the head of the administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired the head of the administration, Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the circle of Putin&#39;s closest people for many years.
Currently, the 63-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative for nature and transport issues.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin &quot;decided to relieve Ivanov from the duties of the head of the administration of the President of Russia,&quot; without giving a reason.
Anton Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012, was appointed instead of Ivanov.
Vaino, 44, is a terrified diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin&#39;s website (in Russian), he later managed the Presidential Protocol and the Administration of Government Employees.
After his appointment, he told Putin: &quot;Thank you for your trust.&quot;
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as the president of the country by developing laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the post and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Are smiles persuasive?
This move has embarrassed Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is a longtime and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked for the Soviet security service, the KGB.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a meeting broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, hardly anyone is convinced by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of a power struggle?
Nobody knows that.
But the official statement that the man who was considered a possible president suddenly wanted to become the head of Russia&#39;s environmental policy himself is being met with great skepticism.
In remarks published on the Kremlin&#39;s website, Ivanov says to Putin: &quot;It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, one might even say problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the KGB State Security Service, like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, with Ivanov as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin&#39;s second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the presidency of Russia, as Putin&#39;s re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
However, at that time another close ally of Putin - Dmitry Medvedev - became the president.
Putin became prime minister and returned to the presidency three and a half years later.
The mysterious appearance of fish in a garden in the town of Banff
A Banff man is asking for help to find out what kind of fish have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels that have traveled up the water column.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted the video of the fish on Periscope in the hope that someone might know how the 5cm fish ended up in his garden.
Queensferry Junction: The bridge is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35 billion project is currently scheduled for completion in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern section of Queensferry Junction and the viaduct, meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The first of the four connecting sections has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The Fife Bridge structure is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, the £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb onto the bridge.
He said: &quot;This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge.&quot;
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel were used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires extreme precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last section connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to be laid.
Michael Martin, project director of the fourth bridge connection, says: &quot;The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge.&quot;
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the highest class of engineering.
After installing the last road section and connecting it to the north tower support, we were left to connect the north road section to the ground section or viaduct.
This was done by moving the north approach viaduct section 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at a slope of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions that the team worked with was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simone Biles wins gold in women&#39;s gymnastics.
Forget the tension.
Forget the anxiety.
All this does not worry Simon Bailes.
Dynamic jumps.
Performs exercises on the log effortlessly.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Absolutely flawless.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won the gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62.198 was head and shoulders above silver medalist and teammate Alia Raisman and bronze medalist Alia Mustafina of Russia.
USA&#39;s Simona Biles performs on balance beam during the women&#39;s individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the all-around title and the fifth-best gymnast, slowly cementing her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears because the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement places him next to unparalleled athletes like Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships, including 10 golds, performing combinations so brilliant, precise and ambitious that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot;the best gymnast she&#39;s ever seen seen&quot;.
In Brazil, she faced the final test, where she had to compete largely with the expectations placed on her, not with the other athletes.
It would be a disappointment for her to return home to Spring, Texas without a gold medal.
USA&#39;s Simona Biles (left) and Aly Raisman embrace after winning the gold and silver medals, respectively, in the gymnastics women&#39;s individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bails won her first gold medal on Tuesday, making a special farewell party for national team coordinator Marta Karolji.
Although Biles claims that she did not expect anything like this during her long road to fame, it is not true.
Part of her free-flowing performance, which includes her signature acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would be perfect on the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
This is not a coincidence.
Adopted by her grandparents as an infant and discovered by trainer Amy Boorman&#39;s mother on a field trip to the gym where Boorman&#39;s workouts were held, the girl has become a force to be reckoned with.
She hasn&#39;t lost in an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, and the streak can continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Although Mustafina took a slight lead during two rotations, it was only an illusion.
The balance beam and free movements - the part of the competition where Bilas will defend her champion title - is still to come.
She led the way with a score of 15.433 on the beam and solidified her lead with a score of 15.933 on the free movement
Raisman hugged her tenderly as they waited for the results, which were just a formality and she burst into tears of joy as the dream she had once written down in her notebook came true.
Raisman&#39;s result was a bit of revenge for events four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafina, but lost the bronze medal match.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call &quot;grandmother&quot;, took a convincing lead.
After a performance in the free movements that dispelled any doubts about her return, she was able to blow an air kiss to the crowd.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old Biles&#39; viral Twitter post r, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives &#39;bullet-riddled&#39; shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, making it the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child&#39;s grandparents confirmed to CBS News in Philadelphia that it is Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say Brown was shot multiple times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television station, &quot;His little body was just riddled with bullets.&quot;
I can&#39;t believe it.
The boy is hospitalized in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown section of the city.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of them was the attacker.
An investigator told CBS Philadelphia that multiple shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
Gun cartridges belonging to different weapons were found at the scene.
It appears to have been a prolonged firefight.
Tubes were found on both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk.
&quot;So it looks like there were multiple gunmen involved in the shooting,&quot; said Philadelphia Police Capt. Anthony Ginaldi.
Several houses and cars were also damaged.
No one has been arrested yet and police are reportedly checking surveillance footage.
A stray bullet hit a 6-year-old girl in the arm while she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Plains neighborhood on Tuesday.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simone, Gaby and Laurie?
I call this the Women&#39;s Olympic Track and Field Team of the Year for several reasons.
First of all, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and Team USA has never been this good.
Second, there are three track and field athletes on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspiring to many girls of young origin.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alyah Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in the sport.
For the past four years, the top gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gaby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now, the world has seen incredible exercises performed by three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women&#39;s individual all-around.
Her teammate Alia Raisman won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport has to offer, but in the rest of the country the situation is completely different when it comes to gym classes.
Simona, Gabby and Laurie made the Olympic team, as did Alia and Madison.
They are the &quot;Olympic Five&quot; because there will be only four athletes on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is coach Marta Karol&#39;s last year as a coach.
Actually, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts mainly train in private athletics clubs and are supported by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, uniforms, hotels (for coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford the sport.
Athletes do all their training in these clubs, and this is an expensive and long-term investment for the families of track and field athletes.
Amy Boorman - coach of Simone Biles and Maggie Heiney - coach of Laurie Hernandez have coached their athletes since both girls started track and field.
We need to give young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie cheaper options for gymnastics training.
I started my athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is based in Harlem and we provide free or low cost exercise training to over 15,000 inner city youth (predominantly black and Hispanic). We have also trained national and international champions.
We will be opening a branch in Detroit (my hometown) in September to provide local youth with an opportunity to experience this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, and also teaches hard work, discipline and goal-striving.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to take up athletics and that is fantastic.
Playing this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Allie, Gabby and Madison for a great demonstration of &quot;Girl Power&quot; by winning Olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls of all backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt&#39;s offer, the new doctors are planning more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association. But it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans for the contract, saying the NHS was in a precarious position and further delays would only harm staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions for working on night shifts and weekends in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, the representative of BMA young doctors, Dr. Elena McCourt said junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will deepen the labor crisis and that it does not provide a level playing field for all doctors.
With eight weeks to go until the first batch of new doctors sign the new contract, progress must be made as time is running out.
The BMA&#39;s efforts to resolve the issue through negotiation have been met with government reluctance to engage and sometimes total silence.
This is despite the fact that as recently as last month Jeremy Hunt said his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now , stop inaction and work with the new doctors.
If he does not do this, then the young doctors are ready for new protest actions.
More than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments were postponed during the latest strike at the end of April while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone on picket.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to increase the weekend rate for the 54,000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Chief Executive Daniel Mortimer called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes don&#39;t solve anything, they only increase the pressure on overworked staff and create worry, stress and disruption for patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been talking to the committee of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have answered positively their questions about guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as staff placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, dropouts and gender pay inequality in medicine - shows that employers , England&#39;s health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements made with BME in November, February and May.
The drug can reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds a day.
Thousands of heart attack patients could be treated with a £2-a-day drug as officials recommend it be given to more people and for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
These drugs are already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a repeat heart attack.
NICE, representing the NHS, recommends taking this medicine for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE, which is currently in charge of the NHS, recommends using this preparation for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Around 140,000 people in England have a heart attack every year and a quarter of those have a repeat heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the blockage breaks, it can form a clot, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if the thrombus detaches from the blood vessel wall, it can travel further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another heart attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots.
New NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and 60mg twice a day for a further 3 years with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, director of health technology at NICE, explains: &quot;Despite the availability of medicines to prevent a repeat heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences.&quot;
Fear of a repeat heart attack can have a negative impact on a person&#39;s quality of life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor, when combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have already had one.
By tentatively recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend treatment options to the thousands of people who will benefit from it.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, when this medication is used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was sacked over corruption, according to a management report.
A government report reveals a culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle has criticized police, election monitors and town councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the electoral process for &quot;fear of offending ethnic and religious interests.&quot;
A former communities secretary turned anti-corruption watchdog says voter intimidation on religious grounds is so common that police should be allowed to station guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should show ID when they vote to prove their true identity.
Currently, voters only need to provide their name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of voters who have voted with special ink to prevent double voting.
Whistleblowers should also be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have greater access to council documents and decisions made by informal committees and working groups.
He says: &quot;The aim is not just to prevent electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it.&quot;
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets borough election scandal.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove city mayor Lutfur Rahman from the post of city mayor due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman &quot;cynically distorted&quot; the religious outlook of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
&quot;Rahman has run his election campaign on the premise that it is the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him.&quot;
About 300 votes were fraudulent or questionable because one person had voted more than once.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud all over the country.
He pointed out that fraud in voting by mail, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their preferred candidates, is particularly worrying.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to establish a person&#39;s identity.
His report says: &quot;Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, particularly women and youth, are being coerced into voting for candidates chosen by community elders, particularly in Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities.&quot;
&quot;There is concern that county institutions are not paying attention to these problems due to political correctness, as ethnic and religious interests could be hurt.&quot;
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which include banning political activists from operating postal ballots to prevent &quot;vote rigging&quot;.
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also called for more scrutiny of registrations to prevent electoral rolls being used for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider requiring voters to present identification before voting.
Mark the fingers of voters who have voted with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically verify the nationality of individuals to ensure that the individual is eligible to vote.
Establish a three-year limit on requests for automatic voting by mail.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with mail-in ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
Provide the police with the power to post security guards at polling stations.
Make changes to the law to make it easier to prosecute people for bullying under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibit photography in polling stations.
Require only English to be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training for poll workers to ensure that voters go to the polls one at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the Metropolitan Police, expressing his bewilderment that no charges have been brought in the Tower Hamlet case.
He says, &quot;The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and cheating.&quot;
He was convincingly convicted under the criminal law standard of proof based on incontrovertible evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective &quot;checking of ticks&quot; of city council voters at voter registration stations.
Sir Eric says: &quot;Last year&#39;s court decision is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the birthplace of Parliament, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the institutions&#39; pretense that fraud does not occur is threatening this good reputation.
Cyclist obsession - Kate&#39;s co-stars and other Rio Olympic celebrity co-stars
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics will be in awe of French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who has been recognized by fans as bearing a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who, according to the media, is proud of her celebrity counterpart.
So, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces gracing our screens right now, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic Games participants who look exactly like Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: USA Archery teammate Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Apart from Kate&#39;s counterpart on the cycling track, many people on the internet are suggesting that this archer could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the US men&#39;s archery team, caused a storm on Twitter when photos of him bearing a striking resemblance to The Wolf of Wall Street were published.
The athlete himself also noticed the storm on social media and admitted that he has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
&quot;I personally don&#39;t see much of a resemblance other than the beard,&quot; Brady tells the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s a good-looking dude, so I take that as a compliment.&quot;
This year, one of the most popular lookalike pairs of the London 2012 Olympic Games will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian track and field athlete Aliya Mustafina has been compared to Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan for her big, expressive eyes.
When it comes to swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Made for Stage star Matthew Morrison for years.

Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett are also long-time counterparts, sharing similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annalina McCord can be proud not only of tanned skin and blond hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that athletic US athlete Nathan Adrian looks like Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) share a similar face shape and eyes.
You&#39;re not alone: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others see these similarities too
Theory: This user thinks there might be a reason why the two look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user gleefully declared that &quot;the rest of the internet seems to agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical.&quot;
The American football star and the &quot;Dexter&quot; actress really have a very similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons involve Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney. Likewise, gold medalist athlete Gabby Douglas boasts a beautiful, broad smile that resembles that of &quot;Bring It On&quot; star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for comment that Chinese swimmer &#39;died like a pig&#39;.
Byron McDonald&#39;s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanha&#39;s fourth-place finish in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay sparked outrage among CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators made comments that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer &quot;flew out of the competition because she smelled&quot; and &quot;ended up like a pig&quot;.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he gave his personal opinion at the end of the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought into the CBC commentary team to add liveliness to the commentary, said: &quot;That little fourteen-year-old girl from China can&#39;t keep up.&quot;
&quot;She ran too much, she flew out of the competition, that she stank and ended up like a pig&quot;.
Thank you very much!
China&#39;s 14-year-old Ai Yanhan clocked 1:57.79 in the second leg, 1.61 seconds slower than Canada&#39;s Taylor Rucka, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted online as they were shocked to hear such a tone and expressions.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: &quot;Did a live CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China &#39;ended up like a pig&#39;????&quot;.
The idiot didn&#39;t realize they were still live.
Ai Yanha of China was named &quot;the little 14-year-old from China who can&#39;t keep up&quot; in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle final.
Criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly gained ground as many demanded an explanation.
Twitter users couldn&#39;t believe Byron McDonald&#39;s insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racists. #disgusting.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who was hosting CBC Live at the time, apologized for MacDonald&#39;s comments, saying, &quot;We apologize that the comment about the swimming result was made live.&quot;
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded on Twitter to the comment.
McDonald&#39;s colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald&#39;s comment.
The channel also quickly issued an apology and statement.
We deeply regret that such comments were made and went live.
Yesterday, we immediately responded and apologized to all live viewers and followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron&#39;s comments were made about the swimmer&#39;s performance and not directed at her personally.
But in any case, they were unprofessional and poorly chosen statements and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald personally apologized live and tried to explain that he didn&#39;t mean his comment to be taken as a personal attack.
On CBC&#39;s Live Olympics, he said: &quot;I&#39;d like to take a moment to apologize for a comment I made yesterday after the women&#39;s freestyle competition.&quot;
I&#39;m talking about the swimmer&#39;s performance, not her personally.
Needless to say, I didn&#39;t mean to be disrespectful and I&#39;m really sorry it happened.
Primark shoppers are shocked by a woman brazenly trying on underwear in the middle of the store.
Shoppers felt uncomfortable when a woman began to undress to try on panties in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she tried them on to make sure they fit her and then took them off, placing the panties back on the store shelf.
She went on to look for clothes in a shop in Folkestone&#39;s Bouverie Place shopping center and tried on four more panties.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone - the place where this woman tried on underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, was also in the store at the time, and says that the unknown woman put on her own clothes after trying on underwear and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took a pair of panties from the rack, pulled off her tights and pants, and measured them on the spot.
She didn&#39;t even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just tried them on right there.
Everyone watched as she took off her panties and apparently the woman didn&#39;t like them because she just put them back on the rack.
She tried on three more panties until she decided she didn&#39;t like any of them and left the store.
She didn&#39;t seem concerned that anyone was watching or thinking about someone buying the clothes she was trying on.
Miss Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: &quot;The idea that someone would buy clothes that have been tried on by someone else and not washed afterwards is disgusting.&quot;
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson adds: &quot;I assume the shop staff took the clothes in question off the shop shelves after she left - which is also acceptable.&quot;
I can&#39;t imagine buying new underwear and finding out that another woman has tried them on and then not washed them.
A Primark spokesperson said Primark was aware of the incident, which took place on Tuesday 9 August.
The specific clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself at close range against attackers with a firearm, we spoke with New York Krav Maga Grandmaster Ron Mizraki.
Whether you&#39;re being attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and get the better of your attacker.
Mizraki points out that if an attacker attacks from behind, you must first turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then you must hold the weapon between your front hand and shoulder and strike the opponent&#39;s face with your free elbow.
Then a knee to the groin follows, and while the assailant freezes in pain, the weapon must be taken away from him, hit in the face with the butt of the weapon, and retreated, continuing to point the weapon at him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - you must avoid the trajectory of the shot, grab the weapon and bend it so that the villain cannot fire.
Simultaneously apply pressure to the weapon and strike the opponent in the chest and finally take the weapon away from him and retreat while still aiming at him.
Sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you are not a Krav Maga master, it is safer to give the robber your money.
A family of vandals vandalize a Saltash Cornwall social home and are evicted.
A family of vandals have been evicted for terrorizing their neighbours, causing £50,000 worth of damage to a social home.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock have just been evicted from a property in Saltash, Cornwall, following a number of complaints.
When they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked housing officials found the property completely ransacked.
There were holes punched in the floors and walls, trash strewn everywhere, and graffiti on the walls.
The family has now been evicted from the property and is likely living on some private property.
Cornwall Housing Service manager Donna McEvoy says there are fears the home will not be able to be rebuilt.
She says that it was extremely difficult for the people who lived here and she believes that people cannot live like this.
In this case there are a number of factors to consider as this property will not have a good reputation in Cornwall going forward.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically stayed at the property, and police say their terror took the form of violence, street brawls with baseball bats, bullying locals, drug use, drug sales and loud yelling and cursing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, in whose name the property was, was sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
Scattered garbage was found in several rooms of the vandalized house.
Several floorboards have also been pulled out of the house, where drugs were allegedly sold.
Neighbors say that they regularly lingered on the street and the police were constantly called.
They were forcibly evicted from the property by Cornwall Housing Authority after being given 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Desperate neighbors were overjoyed at the eviction as their lives were said to be absolute hell.
One said: &quot;They didn&#39;t care about other residents.&quot;
We lived next door to them for 20 years, it&#39;s always been crazy.
It&#39;s unbelievable how often we&#39;ve seen the police here.
We couldn&#39;t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
It&#39;s going to be wonderful here now that they&#39;re finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is head of neighborhood protection at Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family did not co-operate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police have been called here regularly.
Various old and unusable items were found in the overgrown garden of the house.
He also said: &quot;It is very unfortunate that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior as eviction is always the last step considered by Cornwall Housing.&quot;
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and it was very hard for the neighbors to see their behavior.
I appreciate the work put into this case by my entire team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who were brave and co-operated with us in providing the information we needed.
I hope this event will make life easier for neighbors and show that anti-social behavior is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived here at different times, but were all about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after being evicted.
Service personnel will now have to clean up the pile of trash left in the house.
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldone was only found guilty of possessing Class B narcotic substances with intent to distribute them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it became known that they are currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their leases.
Devon and Cornwall Police spokeswoman Angela Crowe says the eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said that: &quot;This is a warning to those who think they can behave as they want and there will be no consequences.&quot;
Criminal and anti-social behavior is not acceptable to Devon and Kronwall Police and will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Willingness to spend can boost the economy.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort city of Cannes has banned burkini swimwear, which covers almost the entire body and closely resembles a wetsuit, on the city&#39;s beaches, local officials said Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linard, has signed an order that &quot;access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone without a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism&quot; as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
&quot;A beach dress that ostentatiously displays religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may create a risk of public order disturbances (crowding, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented,&quot; the order said.
&quot;We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about ostentatious clothing that is associated with allegiance to terrorist movements that are at war with us,&quot; explained Thierry Miguel, head of municipal utilities.
He added that burkini swimsuits have not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since July 28, when Linars, a member of the center-right party &quot;Republicans&quot;, signed this order and it came into force.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille canceled a planned private event for Muslim women wearing burkini swimsuits, amid outrage from politicians on both the right and the left.
In France, it is illegal to wear headscarves covering the face of Muslim women, but not religious symbols or related clothing.
On July 14, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the resort city of Nice near Cannes, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility.
On July 26, two assailants who had sworn allegiance to the &quot;Islamic State&quot; brutally murdered a priest in a church in northwestern France.

Household goods retailer SIA &quot;Jysk Linnen&#39;n Furniture&quot; (&quot;Jysk&quot;) grew its turnover by 5% last year, reaching 23.66 million euros, according to &quot;Firmas.lv&quot; information.
The turnover of the company in 2014 was 22.57 million euros.
The company&#39;s profit also increased slightly - from 781,235 euros in 2014 to 785,896 euros last year.
The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the store in Slokas street in Riga and closed the store in Kurzemes prospect in Riga.
Also this year, similar to other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
Meanwhile, it is recommended to leave the profit made last year undistributed.
&quot;Jysk&quot; is an international chain of stores that offers goods for home improvement.
SIA &quot;Jysk Linnen&#39;n Furniture&quot; was founded in 2001.
The company&#39;s share capital is 3,500,264 euros.
The company belongs to the company &quot;Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC&quot; registered in Iceland.

The festival &quot;Kubāna&quot; has started in Lucavsala.
On the evening of Thursday, August 11, one of the last festivals of this summer was started in Lucavsala - &quot;Kubāna&quot; will be held there until Sunday night.
On the first night, those gathered were spoiled by such groups as &quot;Enter Shikari&quot; from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but disappeared from the program unnoticed, American punks &quot;NOFX&quot;, DJ Maxim from the group &quot;The Prodigy&quot; and others.
On the following days of the festival, the program also includes noteworthy names - &quot;Guano Apes&quot; and &quot;Garbage&quot;, the drummer of the punk rock legend &quot;Ramones&quot; Marky Ramones with &quot;Marky Ramone&#39;s Blitzkrieg&quot;, &quot;Brutto&amp;Lyapis&quot; with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergej Mikhalok at the head, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vakhtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians &quot;Vopli Vidoplyasova&quot; and a number of others, but the full program of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year that the &quot;Kubana&quot; festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but that did not stop the organizers from trying again - they added a long sign to the name, included a Latvian group in the program (Friday evening at 19:15 &quot;All Day Long&quot; will take the stage) and announced that now the festival has become &quot;closer and acquired a local color alongside such symbols of Riga as its skyline and cats&quot;.
It is still too early to say whether these efforts will pay off, as the festival has just started, but as &quot;Delfi Izklaide&quot; observed on the first evening, at least for now, it has not been possible to attract huge crowds and the number of visitors was similar to last year.

The president who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
Friday, August 12, marks 145 years since the birth of the second president of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but has undeservedly remained in the shadow of the widely described first president of Latvia, Jānis Čakste, and the last president of the pre-war period, Kārlis Ulmanis.
None of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, writes Arnolds Auziņš in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgals published ten years ago.
In a conversation with the &quot;Delfi&quot; portal, Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the rare politicians in high positions who had a sense of humor.
The others are so stiff, always very correct.
He taught not to be like that, nowadays it could be similar to what Raimonds Vējonis is.
&quot;He was someone who is close to the people&quot;, says Auziņš.
Today&#39;s politicians do not know history well, they referred to Karl Ullman as a good leader, but hardly anyone knows how bad he was.
At government meetings, the only person he did not shout at was General Balodis.
Even though he is kind and smiling in pictures, he was hysterical by nature.
&quot;Zemgals with his sense of humor and democracy leaves exactly the opposite impression&quot;, says Auziņš.
In a conversation with &quot;Delfi&quot;, Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia agrees with Auzin&#39;s assessment of Zemgala as a calm and balanced statesman.
He also notes that Zemgals was distinguished by his respect for minorities, regularly inviting Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
&quot;At that time, this was not a common behavior, after Zemgal&#39;s presidency, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition&quot;, says the historian.
He was such a quiet and composed person who had to be persuaded to become the president for a long time.
He himself did not pursue it, he simply did not crave fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he believed that the president must know it.
&quot;During the presidency, the basics of the French language were learned&quot;, explains Stranga.
Zemgals did not allow himself to be persuaded to run again, he did not really like high positions at all.
In all respects, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, he was already in a serious position before arriving at the presidential palace - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Also, Zemgals managed the famous Zemgals treasury on Suvorova street 3, where the association of storekeepers and moneylenders was located, practically the state of Latvia was created there during government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
Was not a big admirer of Ulmanis, but did not oppose him publicly either.
&quot;In private conversations, he has sometimes expressed that he really doesn&#39;t like Ulmanis&#39; actions,&quot; says Stranga.
Lived a peaceful life, no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How is Zemgalu remembered today?
It&#39;s a pity, but for a large part, he is only associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were centrist.
&quot;There were no major upheavals during his time, that is, he could be associated with such a really stable presidency,&quot; Stranga sums up.
During the presidency of Gustavus Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia&#39;s state visit to Sweden also took place, which indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighboring country and inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals came to Stockholm on a state visit.
The Swedish King Gustav V&#39;s return visit to Latvia took place on June 29, 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child deal with tantrums.
I often have to face the fact that parents consider the child&#39;s anger and rage to be something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don&#39;t know how to react, says psychologist Ekaterina Kesa in &quot;Econet&quot;.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - anger and rage, which everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression is already a physical action directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, upset, we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can: express, suppress, hide, keep to ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can kick the couch in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dissipate anger!), take a shower, hit a kulak around the table and do other things that we don&#39;t usually do.
We do not direct our aggression towards others because we know various other ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when anger hits them, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name it and how to live with it.
They can say: &quot;Go away!&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re a fool&quot;, &quot;Bad mom&quot;, &quot;I can&#39;t see you&quot;, &quot;I won&#39;t be friends with you&quot; - and very rarely they can say: &quot;I&#39;m angry with you&quot;.
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely present right here in this moment, they are spontaneous and genuine in showing their feelings, and they are often in the grip of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, do not be ashamed of it and do not scold, but on the contrary - help the child.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A long working day in which everything did not go as you would like, or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to &quot;disconnect&quot; from the whole world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a while and breathe a little?
Or does it show that each of the partners has their own way to go?
Men of different ages share their opinions.
Jānis (23) is short and concise: &quot;In my opinion, if you need a break in a relationship, then you are not with the right person&quot;.
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get on your nerves for every little thing, then definitely - this is the right moment when you should explore other hunting grounds to understand whether you miss him, or don&#39;t think much of him or even don&#39;t want to see him anymore .
So the answer is - yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important your other half is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, in a relationship, you need to take a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, arguments are inevitable.
They are caused by noticing every little thing the other person does and it starts to get on your nerves.
People get bored of each other, especially when there is nothing to talk about except what you did during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, which is why I have not lasted more than a couple of months in a relationship.
If you even think for a moment that it is better somewhere else or with someone else - then why does this woman you are with deserve someone who can think that it is not good enough here and beyond the mountains are the fields of paradise?
Just thinking is a small betrayal.
If not, then not.
&quot;I have, so I judge a little those who don&#39;t&quot;. says Edmund (46).
Karl (33) has an almost completely opposite opinion.
I think everyone needs a moment to rest.
You can&#39;t look into each other&#39;s eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to night, and rejoice in undying love.
Find yourself!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, also for a girlfriend or wife, however, if both know how to keep the balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live until the edge of the grave.
That and only that.
Mārtiņš (27) says it like this: &quot;It&#39;s hard to say - it&#39;s necessary or not, you can or you can&#39;t take a break, but one thing is clear - the person who initiates it doesn&#39;t have something in the relationship until the end, something is missing.&quot;
If this question comes up, then you should expect that there will be some changes in the near future - for better or for worse, it depends on you.
I think that while you are still young and crazy, you need to take a break - at least all the time, but when everything becomes serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there is no question of rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
&quot;If you already can&#39;t stand each other&#39;s company and you need a break from time to time, then what will happen when you are retired, who comment on how the passing cats meow or argue about which day the garden should be weeded better&quot;, explains Kristaps (19).
All gentlemen&#39;s names have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rosenthal was the first to arouse interest in the performing arts in the Latvian people.
&quot;In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable&quot;, that&#39;s what Romans Suta once wrote about the old master of Latvian painting, Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when the old master&#39;s extensive retrospective exhibition was opened in the restored main building of the Latvian National Art Museum, it is clear - Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on August 12, but it has been available to visitors since August 13 and will be open for viewing until October 30.
The Latvian National Art Museum is honoring the painter Jani Rozentāls (1866-1916) with an extensive retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall, whose one hundred and fiftieth birthday is internationally included in the UNESCO calendar of celebrated days.
The retrospective exhibition, which presents more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rosenthal&#39;s anniversary program.
The selection of works of art is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Art Museum, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classicist&#39;s creative activity, stylistic changes and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallen-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Writing and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukuma Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is revived by the presence of photos, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the connections of individual works of art with photos taken by the painter himself with his camera for creative purposes.
On the other hand, the Finnish-Latvian partnership &quot;Rozentāls-seura&quot;, named after a Latvian classicist, is simultaneously offering the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition &quot;With a look in Finland, with a heart in Latvia&quot; at the Latvian National Art Museum.
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the autumn in the &quot;Virka&quot; gallery in Helsinki.
Matt LeBlanc is looking forward to his return to TopGear.
TopGear host Matt LeBlanc has said he is looking forward to returning for the second season of the car show, but admitted he doesn&#39;t know what the future holds.
Nothing official is happening yet.
&quot;If there is, the BBC will announce it,&quot; LeBlanc revealed in a conversation with television critics.
Doubts about &quot;Gas in the floor!&quot; future arose in July when LeBlanc&#39;s partner, Chris Evans, announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and &quot;Gas on the floor!&quot; are &quot;made for each other&quot;.
Evans describes the former star of the series &quot;Friends&quot; as &quot;a real and decent man&quot;, thereby dispelling rumors that the friendship between the two had soured during filming.
When asked what he likes most about the show, LeBlanc said traveling to other countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reports that there are no plans to replace Evans in the new 24th season of the show.
Kalviņš: Meldonium could be removed from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year.
It is expected that meldonium, which is part of the Latvian medicine Mildronats, could be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year, the director of the Institute of Organic Synthesis of Latvia, academician Ivars Kalviņš, said on the LNT program 900 seconds on Friday morning.
He said that he will go to Canada in September to discuss the meldonium issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Mildronate will be removed from the &quot;black list&quot; already this year.
In Sigulda, two cyclists were taken to hospital after a collision.
In Sigulda, two cyclists collided on Schweitses Street, sustaining various injuries, the State Police reports.
Men born in 1987 and 1990 were involved in the accident, both of whom were taken to a medical facility.
A cyclist was also injured in a fall in Koknese.
A man born in 1989 fell on 1905 street and was taken to medical care.
On the other hand, a motorcyclist born in 1989 in Dobele district, Naudīte parish tried to avoid a dog that ran onto the road and overturned.
He is also in the hospital.
In the past 24 hours, 71 road traffic accidents were registered in Latvia, in which 16 people were injured.
It will rain and get colder in some places.
Also on Friday, temporary rain is expected in some places in Latvia and it will become a few degrees colder, the LETA agency learned from the Center of Environment, Geology and Meteorology of Latvia.
Thunderstorms are possible in places.
According to forecasts, rain is expected mostly in Kurzeme and the north of Vidzeme.
The maximum air temperature will be only within +16, +19 degrees.
In Riga, the day will pass without precipitation and mostly the sun will shine.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
In his interpretation, the backstage of the US model business has acquired the gloss of a perversely sophisticated photo shoot and the unbearableness of a horror film.
Basically - a very provocative work, balancing sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw the boundary lines between the territory of a European art house film and a Hollywood genre product.
The film with Viggo Mortensen in the main role emphasizes the question of whether the conceptually chosen life models of parents (environmentalism, vegetarianism, alternativeism and separation from the stupidity and values of consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
An idealist father of six children is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and real values after the death of his wife.
A touching, life-wise film, the author of which Matt Ross won the Cannes Festival award for direction this year.
Of course, sharks only do it when they attack beautiful girls - in Jaws it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, played by Blake Lively.
The work required a lot of bravery from her.
This survival solo can be compared to James Franco&#39;s acting in 127 Hours and Ryan Reynolds&#39; performance in Buried Alive.
Perhaps the main actress Mila Kunis is also to blame, whose transformation from a model mother to a creative socialite and almost a mocker of family values seems to have been created only by the fantasy of desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State militants have taken about 2,000 civilians captive as human shields while fleeing Manbij in Syria&#39;s Aleppo province, the US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and monitors said on Friday.
&quot;We did not shoot at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jarabulus,&quot; declared the press representative of the Kurdish Manbij Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Manbij had been liberated from jihadists.
The Islamic State captured Manbij in 2014.
The QSD already last week drove most of the &quot;Islamic State&quot; fighters from Manbij, but some remained and showed fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking prisoners with them.
The Islamists are going to Jarabulus, which is on the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a Syrian activist organization based in London, also reported that the &quot;Islamic State&quot; had kidnapped about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamists hijacked the cars of the city&#39;s residents, forced people into them, and then drove them to Jarabulus.
Islamic State fighters have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists abducted more than 400 civilians, including women and children, as they seized territory in Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria.
Later, the Islamists released about 270 of the captives.
It is not known how many fighters of the Islamic State escaped from Manbij.
The press representative of the Kurdish Manbij Military Council reported that the QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held captive by the Islamists in Manbij.
The information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the battle for Manbij.
299 QSD fighters and 1,019 jihadists were killed.
Kolegova refuses to run for the post of head of the SRS.
The head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), LETA was informed by the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova states that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible, but more often, invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the evaluation of my professional abilities.
&quot;This is also not acceptable to me&quot;, emphasizes the former applicant for the position of head of the SRS.
In the event that her candidacy is approved by the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow her to work fully and implement the necessary changes in the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, full-fledged work would not be possible, Kolegova concludes.
&quot;I have publicly emphasized on several occasions that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is too politicized&quot;, the official explains.
&quot;Thank you for the trust and support shown to me, it is an experience that I value as a benefit&quot;, Kolegova writes in her application to Reizniece-Ozola.
Vienotība said on Wednesday that during the meeting with Koļegova, &quot;significant contradictions&quot; were revealed between the candidate&#39;s explanations and the information available in the public registers about the dividend payments of SIA Pallogs, as the publicly available decisions of the meetings of Pallogs members provide for the non-distribution of profits.
Currently, the duties of the head of the SRS are performed by the deputy director general Dace Pelēkas.
In Līvāni, the police are involved in the rescue of two young children left unattended, informs the Latgale Region Administration of the State Police.
The message about an unattended stroller with babies was received on Friday around 7 am.
They were located in Livani near the former store building.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to medics for assistance.
A bag with documents and a mobile phone were also left there in the cart.
In less than half an hour, the law enforcement officers found out the possible location of the children&#39;s parents and went there.
Arriving at the home of the woman&#39;s civilian husband, the police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was heavily intoxicated.
According to initial information, the woman born in 1992 visited her friend, where she consumed alcohol, in the evening of the previous day.
While walking home after sitting together, the woman decided to leave the children at the store under circumstances that are not yet clear.
The police immediately informed the orphan&#39;s court about the incident, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all recommendations of the State Council regarding the Krievu Island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development in Krievu Island for the transfer of port activities from the city center, Diena.lv portal was informed by the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the next board meeting of the Freeport of Riga.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented according to the opinion of the SC, by preparing the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit conducted by the international auditor Deloitte at the Riga Freeport Authority and the recommendations provided for improving the project management in the future project stage.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to VK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Freeport Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the Supreme Court on the usefulness of the implementation of the Krieviu Island project, we treat the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC) very responsibly.
I would like to emphasize that all the construction works planned as part of the project have been fully completed within the set deadlines and in the planned scope.
&quot;In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including EC, VC and stevedores, that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all VC&#39;s recommendations regarding project management and monitoring issues,&quot; says Sanita Kaire, Krievu Island project manager.
In order to control and monitor the achievement of the project goal, the existing long-term action plan was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the involved parties and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the monitoring tools of the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for achieving the project&#39;s goal by December 31, 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SC, was supplemented with execution monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the deadlines for the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project on the part of the Freeport of Riga.
In order to improve project management and reduce potential risks, a new project management plan has been developed, defining the areas of project management and specifying the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
In order to increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure diagram has been developed, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the employees.
In order to improve the communication of the Freeport of Riga Authority with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the parties interested in the project has been developed, which, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the parties interested in the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the necessity of concluding a service contract or starting a procurement will have to be substantiated in more detail in the future, as well as legality.
As part of the project, a port infrastructure that meets world standards has been built on Krievu Island - four new deep-water berths, railway feeders, as well as engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of last year, achieving a saving of 10.6 million euros in the funding provided for it.
Security at airports in Slovakia has been increased due to threats.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia has strengthened security measures at several airports on Friday, the Ministry of the Interior announced.
&quot;In view of the threat, we have increased security measures at the international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice,&quot; a spokesman for the Slovak Interior Ministry told the AFP news agency on Friday.
&quot;The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analyzing the information we have received,&quot; he added.
An informal summit of the European Union (EU) will be held in the capital of Slovakia on September 16, in which all countries of the bloc, except Great Britain, will participate.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Great Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU presidency until January.
German researchers debate the number of &quot;victims of the Berlin Wall&quot;.
The death toll along the border of communist-ruled former East Germany could be much higher than previously thought, according to a new study, but doubts remain about the true toll.
According to data released Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people who tried to escape from the territory controlled by them were murdered by the communist authorities of Western Germany and later West Germany.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and periodically corrects the death toll.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned as his family tried to reach West Germany through what was then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are deserters from the Soviet army.
&quot;The final extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented,&quot; admits museum director Aleksandra Hildebrandt.
&quot;Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape from the communist-controlled country are maintained and do not disappear,&quot; Hildebrandt&#39;s statement emphasized.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
&quot;The number 1841 is unconvincing,&quot; says Jochen Staats, an expert on the history of East Germany at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have been able to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that 138 people were murdered by communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
Taking into account the people who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or reach the West through the territory of neighboring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
But it is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be the different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all suicides of East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that do not involve direct violence.
&quot;If seniors in their 70s and 80s died of heart attacks after contracting border controls,&quot; it must be the result of this &quot;killer border,&quot; Hildebrandt said.
But the State is adamant that a distinction must be made between elderly people who may have died as a result of the mistreatment they experienced and those whose deaths were caused by a long wait in hot weather on a bus at the border.
Regardless, tallying the victims is not easy because communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers must sift through documents in various scattered archives, the state says.
However, the State group has recently come across new documents, and therefore it may come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF president Pone went to Rio with a coach&#39;s accreditation; itself is a surprise.
Kaspars Pone, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), who has gained notoriety in recent days, has come to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro with a coach&#39;s accreditation, but he himself is surprised by it.
On Wednesday, a wide stir was caused by the statements of Olympic swimmer Alona Rybakova&#39;s coach, German Jakubovski, who revealed that Pone decided to go to Rio de Janeiro at the last moment, while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially, swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the president of the federation Pone were confirmed in the list of riders.
The Latvian Swimming Federation announced five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the departure, Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that German will be there and tickets are being sought for him.
&quot;However, obviously for objective reasons he didn&#39;t make it,&quot; said Pone, expressing the opinion that this did not affect Rybakova&#39;s result.
At the federation&#39;s request, Uvja&#39;s coach took it upon himself to help her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the IOC executive committee, sharply criticized the IOC&#39;s actions, shifting the blame to the organization that oversees Olympic sports.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five persons in the LOK executive committee and not remove one of them.
&quot;I don&#39;t know why there was not enough space for the Swimming Federation&quot;, Pone said that the society did not appreciate the work of the federation and its presidents, reminding that the presidents of the federations do not receive salaries.
Pone also criticized Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Aquatics Federation (FINA) with a complaint and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone, however, could not say why he is at the Olympic Games with the coach&#39;s accreditation, which probably should have belonged to Jakubovski.
&quot;I was applied as the president of the federation (&quot;team leader&quot;), but for unknown reasons I received the coach&#39;s accreditation and now I can&#39;t get anywhere.&quot;
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
Until the last moment, I thought that German would be there, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the LETA agency, a couple of days before Ribakova&#39;s start, she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni, after which the swimmer had tears in her eyes, however, the LPF president himself expressed that it was an everyday conversation with the desire to tune the athlete up before the start.
Pone reminded that the LPF oversees five sports that are in the Olympic program, and in four of them training is held for children in Latvia as well.
The president of the Federation expressed that the issues of drowning are also very important in Latvia and he also spoke about such programs when he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup could be held in Latvia.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programs.
600,000 baby salmon will be released into the Daugava.
As part of JSC Latvenergo&#39;s fish resources restoration program, salmon and sea trout juveniles are being released this week in the Daugava near Mangaļsala, and this year it is planned to release more than 600,000 one-year-old salmon and sea trout juveniles raised in the Tomes and Dole fish farms of the scientific institute Bior.
LETA informed the Latvenergo agency that the release of fish will continue in the following months - a total of 6,300,000 fish fry and larvae of various species are released into the water bodies of the Daugava basin every year.
Pike and lamprey larvae will be released in the spring and early summer of 2016, in June - whitefish, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zanders and walleyes.
Latvenergo production director Māris Kunickis said that caring for the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvenergo concern.
&quot;In measures for the protection and propagation of fish resources, everyone&#39;s actions are focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both by raising and releasing fish fry into the Daugava basin, and by implementing other activities&quot;, said Kunickis.
This year, more than 600,000 year-old salmon and trout fry will be released into the Daugava estuary.
For the second year, the baby fish are marked by cutting off the adipose fin before being released.
Today&#39;s shipment includes 25,000 baby salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, fish fry and larvae are released into the water bodies of the Daugava and its basin in a scientifically based species composition and numerical volume.
The reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava and the water bodies of its basin is carried out by Bior in accordance with the regulatory enactments, based on the expertise of the damage caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo&#39;s economic activity and providing a conclusion on what compensation measures should be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, the State Environmental Service, based on the aforementioned expertise, makes a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo&#39;s annual compensation amount in the fish resources restoration program is EUR 1,035,000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association &quot;Mēs zivīm&quot;, placed 400 artificial fish spawning nests in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ikškile for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the association, promoting the natural spawning of fish, is an initiative additionally supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish resources restoration program.
Placing artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava.
The festival &quot;Sanssusi Concert Hall&quot; has a country yard, a forest, a clearing.
Sleep in a tent, eat like in a restaurant, walk in sneakers and listen to sophisticated chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - this is the combination offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sanssusi, which is inviting you to Aknīste region for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the yard of the former parish house of Susėja - a village that no longer exists, in the nearby woods and clearings.
In three days - from August 12 to 14 - on five stages you can combine the carefree enjoyment of nature and the refined enjoyment of academic music.
Here, music meets theater and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest forms, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but it only takes a few minutes to get a smile on your face and lightness on your feet.
&quot;Please don&#39;t look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people don&#39;t go to one specific event or artist, because the real taste of Sanssusi can only be captured by spending all three days there,&quot; says the initiator and host of the festival, opera baritone Armands Siliņš.
We open the gates of the festival on Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be programs on site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the busiest - from 9.00 in the morning until the next dawn.
&quot;The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv&quot;, says Armands Siliņš.
The magnificent bouquet of artists includes, for example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartets Quadra and RIX and even Estonian aerial acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Ārik Kiršfeld , Mārtiņa Zilberta and actress Anci Strazda created the contemporary circus show Confines about the artist&#39;s inner struggle.
New works have also been created especially for the festival.
Entomologist (insect researcher) Uģis Piterāns will take part in the children&#39;s show &quot;Kukainis&quot;, composed by Olesja Kozlovska and Jēkabs Nīmanis based on the motifs of F. Kafka&#39;s story Transformation, along with Armandas Siliņas, musicians and actors.
Oskars Herliņš composed the first String Quartet, while Anna ķirse - the Tree Opera, a performance whose main characters will be trees in three small clumps in the three-hectare clearing, directed by Andras Kalnozola, with video projections by Katrīna Neiburgas and scenography by Andras Eglīš.
Singing in the voices of Laima Lediņa, Dināra Rudāne and Zigmāras Graš, they will end up in a romantic relationship, just like in the study of Swedish naturalist Karl Linnaeus of the Enlightenment era, Tree Wedding (1729).
Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, one of the biggest hopes of the Latvian delegation, the heptathlete, is starting the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro today.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will start the competition in the 100-meter hurdles at 15:35 Latvian time, while the high jump competition is expected at 16:50.
On the other hand, the shot put will start at 2.35 on the night of Saturday, while the 200 meter sprint will start at 4.05.
The heptathlon competition will be concluded on Saturday, when the long jump, javelin throw and 800 meters run will take place.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won bronze at the World Championship last year, was mentioned as a medal contender for the Olympic Games.
Back in May, the Latvian set a new national record (6,622 points) and won second place in the prestigious heptathlon competition in the Austrian city of Getsis.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympic Games, when she won ninth place with a repeated Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, the athlete has broken the national record four times.
Latvian judo wrestler Artūras Nikiforenko is also scheduled to start today at 4 p.m., who competes in the weight category over 100 kilograms, having a fight with Azerbaijani athlete Ušangi Kukauri in the first round.
This will be the first Olympic Games in the judoka&#39;s career.
The agency LETA already reported that on Thursday in the weight category up to 100 kilograms Latvian judo wrestler Yevgenijs Borodavko experienced a loss already in his first fight.
He lost to Japan&#39;s Hagu Ryunoski, who went on to win bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolods Zeļonis brought the Olympic bronze medal to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic Games, Latvian judokas won only one victory in seven fights, which was achieved by Borodavko in London.
At 4:30 p.m. Latvian time, Dainis Upelnieks will start the qualification competition in the stand shooting, but the selection will end on Saturday.
Upelnieks received his Olympic ticket only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, however, he later revealed to the LETA agency that he had been quite confident about driving since April.
The athlete arrived at the venue of the Olympics as one of the first athletes from Latvia, trying to make maximum use of the training opportunities at the competition shooting range.
At 7:05 p.m. Latvian time, the final three races will be made by the debutant of the Olympic Games, 17-year-old Latvian sailor Ketija Birzule, who competes in sailing for surfboards in the RS:X class.
After three days or nine races, Birzule is currently in 25th place among 26 female athletes.
On the other hand, the decisive final race for the medals will take place on Saturday.
Today, the competition in academic rowing is finally scheduled to be held, where the Latvian representing Ireland, Sanita Pushpurei, is to take part.
On Wednesday, the race was canceled due to bad weather.
At 19.10, Pushpure will compete in the women&#39;s singles C/D semi-finals, fighting for the 13th place in the Olympics.
In Tuesday&#39;s quarterfinal race, she finished fourth, from a third position that would have kept her in contention for a medal, just 0.65 seconds behind.
Pushpure won 13th place already four years ago in London, when she also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be distributed at the Olympic Games - in archery, athletics, track cycling, equestrian, fencing, ski jumping, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will nominate Garland as a Supreme Court justice.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid is confident that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merrick Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland&#39;s confirmation since President Obama nominated her in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president will choose who will replace current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
During his conference call Thursday, Reid said he was confident Clinton would pick Garland.
Reid&#39;s spokeswoman later said that he had not personally discussed this topic with Clinton and that it was only speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton&#39;s team would not want to &quot;rock the boat&quot; with another choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland&#39;s nomination are &quot;proxies&quot; and are acting in the interests of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump is not fit for the job of president.

Treat magazine will collaborate with photographer David Belmeer to create a 2017 Pirreli calendar in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Muses calendar, it plans to showcase young supermodels instead of naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Treats president Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art magazine is different from old-fashioned Playboy because &quot;Playboy is a men&#39;s magazine.&quot;
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he&#39;s talking about the calendar too.
In a press release about the calendar, Shaw says, &quot;We need to return to a timeless and classic representation of nudity in images where the female body does not confuse, but inspires women and men alike.&quot;
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great piece of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person at casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
In Rembate, a buyer drives away while trying out a motorcycle.
On August 10, at 10 a.m., a &quot;Yamaha YZ250&quot; motorcycle, which was not registered, was stolen from the yard of a house in Rembate Parish, the State Police informs.
The owner of the motorcycle wanted to sell the vehicle with the help of an advertisement.
At the agreed time, the potential buyer arrived, got on the motorcycle as if to test it and left.
The staff of the Ogre police station of the Riga regional administration of the State Police ask anyone who can provide any information useful for the investigation to contact them in connection with the crime that occurred.
Please call: 65002403 (during working hours) or 65002400 (24/7).

The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says that the longevity record belongs to a female that could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
A French court rejects a claim to demolish shops in the &quot;Jungle&quot; refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the &quot;Jungle&quot; camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At a court hearing this week in Calais, authorities said the state should demolish 72 self-made shops where people in the camp sell goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros. in restaurants.
The Calais prefect&#39;s office said these self-created businesses must be demolished because they create a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to deport the people who set up the 72 self-made shops, but it understood the concerns of the prefect of Calais.
Judge Jean-Francois Moll said food, coffee and restaurateurs play a bigger role than simply providing food to people living in &quot;extremely poor conditions&quot;.
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One site at risk of demolition is the camp&#39;s Jungle Book Kids cafe, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum counseling to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children&#39;s cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure of the cafe &quot;would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as 8 years old.&quot;
On Friday, two charitable organizations &quot;Help for Refugees&quot; and &quot;L&#39;Auberge des Migrants&quot; reported that the number of residents of the &quot;Jungle&quot; camp has increased to 9,000 people, which is the highest figure since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Great Britain claim silverware in the rugby sevens series as Fiji&#39;s national team masterfully win gold.
The impressive performance of the British national team in the stage of the rugby-7 series ended on Thursday, when in an exciting final match at the &quot;Deodoro&quot; stadium in Rio Fiji, the national team convincingly defeated them with the result 43:7.
Fiji displayed a master class in possession, footwork, support play and brute force play to win gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
Defeat brought a respectable consolation prize - a silver medal, Britain&#39;s third medal of the day. The Great Britain team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby sevens tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard-fought semi-final, where the Boks suffered a 7-5 defeat in the first half of the day, may have backfired on Great Britain in the final.
But in any case, Fiji are in their best form right now to beat the 15-man team as well.
Although unlikely, there could be some consolation for Great Britain in the fact that at least one Brit won a gold medal. It is the head coach of the Fiji national team, Ben Ryan - the former coach of England from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the rugby sevens series in Adelaide.
This time they only lost one game.
Defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji made an impressive start to the match, fending off Great Britain&#39;s power plays with gusto.
It was like a bus crash for captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau scored the first touchdown.
In the last four minutes, Gerry Tuwai also increased the advantage even more by scoring a touchdown on the right wing.
The score 12-0 and the British team hadn&#39;t even really touched the ball.
Mitchell&#39;s superb power play denied the feisty Leoni Nakarava a three-pointer, but it had little effect on Fiji&#39;s result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, extending the lead over Great Britain to 17-0.
Nakarava further extended their lead after a turnover and there was more than a minute to go... the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some clumsy British power plays and crossed the line to score.
The touchdown made it 29-0.
Fiji seemed born to play rugby sevens while the British were still learning.
In fact, that is true.
Great Britain made a big change at half-time, breaking through the Fijian line... a full four minutes, which was good by first-half standards, until Joshua Tuisow, after some fantastic team play, scored a few more points for Fiji.
Dan Norton scored for the British team with a touchdown in the left corner to make it 36-7, but the game was already lost as South Sea Islanders fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
One cannot help but admire Fiji&#39;s cheerful attitude.
Mata Wiliame made Fiji&#39;s victory even sweeter with another late game touchdown.
When the final whistle blew, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British could only sit on the grass after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while the British were outclassed by South Africa in a very tight contest where both teams scored a touchdown each and the South Africans lost by just a few points.
Kyle Brown gave the Boks the lead in the first half, but in the second half Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant skill to put the ball between the posts to give the British victory.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England Under-15s player Antony, had a great power play late in the game to give the team victory and another silver medal.
A coach&#39;s battle with cancer has inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win a rowing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and that&#39;s saying a lot.
From the first stroke to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning&#39;s golden moment had a special meaning at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although just the two athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by the echo of Robin Williams, who inspired them to a second Olympic gold medal in women&#39;s double rowing, becoming the first women in British sporting history to achieve such a feat.
They were unquestionably dominant as they achieved an unbeaten, unprecedented victory for the 39th time.
The two great athletes gliding across the surface of the water with the elegance of a swan does not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal won in rowing is a whole team that works hard so that the athletes continuously improve their performance, and the biggest contribution to their success was made by the coach, who 30 months ago did not know if he would live this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those things that can be operated on and I did.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would get out of control.
It changes your vision a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Lucky for the trio, Williams was able to begin the recovery process early in the 2014 offseason and keep the layoff to a minimum, so to speak.
I needed the income, so I needed to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked distances of 6, 10 and even 15 meters, although the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
That&#39;s how it all started.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who had been very nervous all morning and was talking more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Stanning, who has served with the Royal Artillery in Afghanistan, said: &quot;It&#39;s been an emotionally difficult week but it means a lot to me.&quot;
It just confirms how much it means to us and how hard me, Helen and Robin have worked.
The past 3 years with Helen and Robin have been great.
We wouldn&#39;t have achieved anything without Robin, so a big thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can&#39;t think of a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The pair reach such a tremendous speed that their competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover&#39;s lead was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen yelled, &quot;Keep the beat, keep the beat.&quot;
Staying focused is really important.
We got off to a good start, but at the same time we didn&#39;t have high expectations.
We didn&#39;t set out to break any records that day, just row well and win the race and that&#39;s what we did.
Will rest for a couple of years to decide what to do next.
Next month is the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bachall.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn&#39;t want to say that this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very nervous.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said: &quot;It feels fantastic.&quot;

Kolegova will be &quot;promoted to the end&quot; as head of the SRS.
According to him, now Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (Greens and Farmers&#39; Union) and Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens and Farmers&#39; Union) are already &quot;fundamentally important&quot; to approve Kolegova, the candidate nominated by the Minister of Finance, as head of the SRS.
Rajevsky estimated that for both Kučinskis and Reizniece-Ozola in this government, the approval of the head of the SRS is the &quot;first big decision that can affect their future as politicians.&quot;
If the position on the selection of a candidate for the head of the SRS starts to change now, it will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The agenda of next week&#39;s meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of the transfer of VVD head Kolegova to the position of Director General of the SRS, according to the government&#39;s agenda.
Kolegova was promoted to the position of head of the SRS by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola after Ināra Pētersone resigned from the leadership of the service and when the competition for the post of SRS General Director ended without a result.
In an interview with Latvian Radio on Thursday, August 11, Acting Head of the SRS, Dace Pelēkās, admitted that if she were offered to run for the position of head, she might agree.
However, the Finance Minister later admitted that she is not considering other candidates for the post of head of the SRS for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, the leader of the Saeima faction of the National Union, also admitted that NA always supports Kolegova under the leadership of SRS.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is threatened by the inability to form a government.
A month ago, on July 12, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal have not implemented sufficiently extensive measures to reduce the level of the budget deficit to the 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) required by the Eurozone.
Calculations show that, despite the implemented austerity measures, Portugal&#39;s budget deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, while Spain&#39;s was 5.1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal goals for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against the two mentioned countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative sentiment.
Critics, however, point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, agreeing on uniform rules from the beginning and then not being able to apply them in practice.
Thus, for example, the president of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, has pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, creating the impression in the population that the rules of the European Union are recommendatory, not binding.
Now the EC has proposed and all member states have approved the extension of the budget deficit adjustment deadline until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to check the progress achieved by both countries in the coming months, at the same time stating that both Spain and Portugal should be ready to implement additional austerity measures if the circumstances require it.
Preliminary forecasts show that Portugal could achieve the set goal on time and already this year the budget deficit could decrease to 2.5% of the gross domestic product.
This means that within the framework of the Stability Program, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year&#39;s budget, with additional attention paid to controlling the costs of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, for the next two years, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually.
Achieving these goals is made especially difficult by the fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on the formation of a government for eight months, and the possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year is increasing.
However, public opinion polls show that even the third election would not significantly change the political scene in the country.
The most popular party is still the People&#39;s Party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who would again win less than 33% of the vote in the elections.
Only the socialists have slightly increased their popularity, while the popularity of the anti-austerity parties &quot;Podemos&quot; or &quot;Together we can&quot; and &quot;Ciudadanos&quot; or &quot;Citizens&quot; has slightly decreased.
The People&#39;s Party wants to get the socialists and &quot;Ciudadanos&quot; involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the 2017 budget draft to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
As the representative of the parliamentary faction of the People&#39;s Party, Rafael Hernando, has announced, if the government fails to be formed and the parliamentary elections are still held for the third time, Spain will become the laughingstock of the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
After surveying the beaches for the fifth year, the activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of garbage found increases every year, and visitors to the bathing areas are mostly to blame.
The most polluted swimming spots are exactly in Riga.
The city council explains that the swimming areas are cleaned every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land can be washed into the water during rainstorms, thus significantly impairing its quality.
Except for Liepāja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches in other parts of Latvia is critical.
This announcement was made this week by the volunteers of the &quot;My Sea&quot; campaign.
Measuring the road along the Gulf of Riga on foot for the fifth year, activists have concluded that the amount of waste left by residents has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, that assessment of criticality has come.
&quot;We see that this will be a year when the amount of garbage on 100 meters of the beach may even exceed 200 items,&quot; says Jānis Ulme, representative of the &quot;Mana jūra&quot; expedition.
Called by Latvian Radio, he was on the beach of Tūja, where the march of volunteers continues along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, among various household waste and remains of picnics, activists even had to collect fluorescent lamps, which were left lying in the sea sand.
Ulme, a participant and organizer of the hike, says that the residents are to blame for the pollution.
&quot;The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the stage of degradation, it is no longer possible to identify them, and cigarette butts, bottles, corks,&quot; says Ulm.
Swimming places in Riga are also among the dirtiest beaches.
For example, in Daugavgrīva, almost 800 waste units are collected every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that cigarette butts are thrown at almost every step and warning or prohibition signs are not everywhere.
&quot;The average figures for all three Riga swimming areas together - Daugavgrīva, Vakarbulli and Vecākai - are unfortunately high and far exceed the desired or goal that Latvia is supposedly moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020&quot;, concludes the environmentalist.
Cleaning of swimming areas in Riga takes place every day, even twice on the hottest days of summer, explains Uģis Vidauskis, the representative of the city council.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the question of the culture of these people.
&quot;Even special signs do not affect those who fertilize, drink alcohol, smoke and do all those things that are not allowed&quot;, says Vidauskis.
That&#39;s why Vidauskis calls on visitors to swimming areas to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point out these violations and fight everyone in this way.
Maybe some new warnings can be imposed, but as I said, it is unlikely to radically change the situation.
&quot;Because everyone should simply address and be intolerant of such violators together,&quot; he emphasizes.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official swimming places.
This year, as in other years, the water quality is said to be good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that in all 56 swimming areas the water quality has been good all the time and there are no bathing restrictions.
&quot;We will take the analyzes for the last time at the end of August&quot;, says Normunds Kadiķis, the inspector&#39;s senior specialist in environmental health issues.
Garbage left on land can be washed into the water during heavy rains.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmentalist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - a change of leader in Putin&#39;s administration.
Pat left the post?
Vladimir Putin has informed the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this position himself and will continue to be the president&#39;s special representative for nature protection, ecology and transport issues.
Announcing the changes, Putin addressed Ivanov in front of television cameras: &quot;Dear Sergey Borisovich, we have been working together for many years and we are doing it successfully.&quot;
I am satisfied with the way you perform the duties assigned to you.
I remember well our agreement not to use you in this position of head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I understand your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that you will make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position.
However, it is emphasized that leading the presidential administration is a very important position and it made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Taking into account that the State Duma elections are expected in Russia next month, there have been rumors that this step is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov has also been called a possible successor to Putin in the post of president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the position of the president&#39;s representative on nature conservation and transport issues has raised doubts.
According to the archive of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the colonel general of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a longtime and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin&#39;s reign, she was appointed as the Secretary of the Security Council of Russia.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the &quot;Information Security Doctrine&quot; developed by Ivanov was approved, which, among other things, provided for the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, and already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defense industry companies and the export of weapons.
Now, after leaving the position of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also keep his seat in the National Security Council of Russia, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also work.
Vaino comes from a family in the elite of the Soviet party.
The position of head of the presidential administration was recommended to Vaino by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
Even from the time when we worked in the government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years, we communicate practically every day.
&quot;Therefore, I am sure that he is ready for this job according to all his professional and personal qualities,&quot; said Ivanov.
Vaino comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including its first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The Internet edition &quot;Meduza&quot; with reference to the book &quot;Estonian self-determination and independence&quot; writes that in the late 1980s, Karl Vaino allegedly asked Moscow to give permission to use force against the participants of the demonstrations.
However, he allegedly received a refusal and soon lost his position.
Shortly after that, Vaino moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and is fluent in Japanese.
However, he has retired from the diplomatic service to work in the Presidential Protocol Office.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been shaken by the suspension and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors of several regions and federal representatives.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is reorganizing the ruling elite before the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features - representatives of power structures are more and more often in leading positions.
Judo wrestler Nikiforenko also loses in the first match of the Olympic Games.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo wrestler has concluded his participation in the Olympic Games by finishing in 17th place.
Coach Oļegs Baskins admitted to Latvian Television that Nikiforenko&#39;s expectations were very low, and this was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the judo wrestler suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is significant that in order to reach the Olympic ticket, Nikiforenko had to compete in a different weight category than usual - that is, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been reported that Yevgenii Borodavko held his ground against Ryunosuki for two and a half minutes in the fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms, until his opponent managed a shot worthy of a clear victory.
Thus, Latvia has concluded the judo competition in Rio.
Dreams disappear in the sands of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by judoka Yevgenii Borodavko.
Yes, he faced a more titled opponent, but the ambitious can sometimes surprise.
He did not provide.
For Artur Nikiforenko, the task was even more complicated, because he has less experience and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, although he stayed on the tatami for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, Latvian judokas lack ambition the most recently.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial supporter Vladimir Šestakovs left the federation, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, &quot;Golden Score&quot; no longer takes place - the development of judo is on a downward curve.
Jackevich, who advises Kazakhstan&#39;s judokas here, and Vsevold Zelioni have no heirs in sight.
But if you don&#39;t grow up, there won&#39;t be either.
And that is the prerogative of the Federation.
That is why the promise of the president of the Latvian Judo Federation to win medals in Rio sounded as if from another galaxy in &quot;Morning Panorama&quot;.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening, we waited impatiently and anxiously for the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Šmēdins - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as in the &quot;death&quot; group - the games are over for the losers.
The Latvian duet had a small exception - they could have lost, but by no more than four points in two sets.
The tension was further increased by the prolonged previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy court swirled throughout the match.
The gusty wind created additional complications for the players.
At first, it seemed that it could be our - who are more versatile - ally.
But it didn&#39;t happen.
It was quite easy to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve to Samoilov and wait for him to break.
It broke against Canada, it broke against Cuba at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was no joke.
Šmēdins was able to fish at that time because there was little work, but when there was, he did it to his credit.
Samoilov with Shmēdins could win the Brazilians in two sets, as he took the lead with 16:15 in the first, but he remained at 16, exhausting the limit of lost points.
But it was possible to lose with 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, thanks to the wind, we managed to win.
The third one was already on Evandru&#39;s service mark.
A chain was formed - an unconvincing serve was received, the second pass often flew too close to the net and Samoilov had very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a stranger Samoilov on the field against the Cubans, then this time he worked more successfully, and it would be unprofessional to blame the loss only on Saša.
Kreilis also made a mistake, and it is quite symbolic that he hit the last ball in the block.
Losing team.
This time there was definitely a lack of luck - in the third set alone, two of Evandru&#39;s attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two runs were near the line.
The video also decided the controversial episode in favor of the opponents.
If Evandru struggled with his serves in the first two games, they were very productive against ours.
Everything added up to a loss on the scoreboard.
Now calmly analyze the causes of the failure.
Maybe you should have lived next to the stadium like many, and not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours on the way.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by the series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe you shouldn&#39;t have played in Klagenfurt, but come here sooner and acclimatize better.
Maybe there was a glitch with finding the peak of athletic form.
So far more questions than answers.
The games are over for our beachies.
The dream of medals is over.
What&#39;s next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments left and also Jurmala Masters.
Šmēdins and Samoilov have never been friends in life and will never be, because their personalities are too different.
But it is not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, the thought of divorce may arise, because the fault will be sought not only in oneself, but also in the partner.
Divorce is not difficult, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play beach, but Jānis and Tom have already tried and also parted, while Mihail Samoilovs is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
You can try to return Harald Regža, Aleksandar Solovey, Edgar Toča to Mārtiņi Pļaviņas, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself more than once in the stages of the World Cup.
The sands of Copacabana were not smiling on them this time.
And all.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples are entering the circuit, and only a few are less than two meters tall.
This does not yet guarantee success, but it is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Ours don&#39;t stay longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the organizers of the games, or to choose their own.
The US basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Some beach volleyball players have also found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, greatly exaggerated prices were demanded for the quite modest accommodations offered to the journalists.
Therefore, the choice fell on renting apartments.
There is a risk because sometimes they can be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk pays off.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 meters away, the beach arena is half an hour&#39;s walk away.
The area is quite safe, because the favelas are nearby, but you shouldn&#39;t lose your vigilance here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people immediately think of, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media, Vladimir Ivanov.
PS Looks like another medal dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
In the 100-meter hurdles and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa fell short of her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, &quot;Porgys and Bess&quot; plays in Liepāja.
In Latvia, the opera &quot;Porgys and Bess&quot; premiered in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been performed again.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsu Art Festival and the Liepāja Art Forum, in close cooperation, have decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin&#39;s masterpiece.
&quot;We are very happy that after a ten-year break, when Liepāja was last able to enjoy an opera production, this excellent concert production version of George Gershwin&#39;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; can be enjoyed here in the new, newly opened concert hall &quot;Lielais dzintars&quot;, says the concert hall. Baiba Bože, manager of &quot;Great Amber&quot;.
The opera &quot;Porgy and Bessa&quot; is a story told in bright musical language about love, its impermanence, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday joys.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance, that makes it so alive.
&quot;And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and somehow really deep&quot;, says director Viesturs Kairiš.
What I like most - when listening or playing this opera, there are always such stopping points - the famous melodies, the famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or the chorus, or the orchestra.
&quot;It&#39;s the most exciting thing, this building,&quot; says Andris Poga, the musical director and conductor of the concert production of the opera &quot;Porgys and Bess&quot;.
Opera-goers agree that it is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear this world-famous Gershwin opera.
It is blessed that in Liepāja you can feel the breath of the world.
&quot;Professional execution&quot;, the opera is evaluated by the visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert performance was special in that in the newly opened &quot;Lielais dzintars&quot; concert hall, an orchestra played in the orchestra pit for the first time and an opera concert performance took place for the first time.
The square near the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentals.
Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks said at the opening of the Rozentālas jubilee exhibition that the address of the museum itself in the future might not be Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Jania Rozentālas Square 1.
The director of the museum, Māra Lāce, admitted that the re-registration of the address will create a considerable bureaucratic burden, however, in general, she welcomes this idea and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, creating a monument to Janis Rozentāls by Burkard Dzenis, which stands near the museum.
The director of the museum at the time, Vilhelms Purvītis, was one of the initiators of the construction of this monument.
In this way, this next step could be purely logical.
My conscience always bothers me a bit - but Vilhelms Purvītis, where are we going to put his name?!
&quot;But if you, Mr. America, promise to think&quot;... said the Bear.
It has been reported that the National Art Museum building officially opened its doors in May of this year after extensive reconstruction and modernization.
The reconstruction of the VEF Palace of Culture will finally start this week.
The palace will be renovated by SIA &quot;Velve&quot; for approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several palace rooms, including two auditoriums, as well as adapt the building for people with mobility impairments.
The Riga City Council intends to attract European Union funds for the project in the amount of six million euros, however, Director of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, Oļegs Burovs, admits that there is still no complete clarity about European funds for the project.
&quot;Despite the fact that there is a political will to start repairs to the VEF Culture Palace by attracting European structural funds, we are waiting for months for a decision, a real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether the money will be allocated or not&quot;, says Burov.
Last December we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you should make your own decision, that Brussels does not make a decision here.
At the moment we see that another round of discussion is forming, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
&quot;I want to say that the Riga City Council guarantees without a doubt that this process will be started and completed on time,&quot; says Burov.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the renovation of the building, which is about to take place.
Although a year passed, the renovation of the building still had not started and the collective continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Palace of Culture is divided into seemingly independent sets of reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the palace.
The first - increasing the accessibility of VEF Culture Palace and beautifying the surrounding area.
It is planned to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second - improvement of the service offer of VEF Culture Palace.
It is planned to restore the building&#39;s interior, walls and ceilings, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the building&#39;s internal engineering communications.
Third - Improvement of working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of &quot;Livu&quot;, you can get to know the legendary rock band at an exhibition in Liepāja.
The exhibition will feature various items characterizing &quot;Livus&quot; - photos arranged in a timeline to reflect the group&#39;s activities from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group&#39;s activities was announced.
The participants&#39; stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the general public, which reflected the creative activity of the &quot;Līvi&quot; group.
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the collection of the Liepāja Museum.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieci.
The musicians who were associated with the group &quot;Līvi&quot; and their relatives responded to the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of &quot;Livu&quot; can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal-instrumental ensemble was created in the Liepāja House of Culture, led by Juris Pavītols.
In its original composition, the ensemble participated in the festival &quot;Liepājas dzintars&quot; in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
The fateful meeting took place in 1976, when Juris Pavītols met Ārik Ķiģeli and founded a group at the Metalurga Palace of Culture, inviting Ingrīda Gūtmani, Andri Krūziņa and Jānis Groduma to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
Members have joined, others have gone their separate ways, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is capable of living and existing - has remained unchanged.
&quot;There was no shortage of things to see - in jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys noticeably differed from the generally accepted stereotype of pop singers,&quot; says music reviewer Klaas Vävere about the group.
In addition to the aforementioned musicians, such excellent musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācenājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Klein and many others have worked in the group.
Entrance to the exhibition is free.
The exhibition can be viewed from August 19 to October 30.
On the other hand, on August 27, the &quot;LĪVIfest 2&quot; celebration of the 40th anniversary of the group &quot;Līvi&quot; will be held at the &quot;Pūt, vējiņi&quot; concert garden in Liepāja.
Inflation is observed in Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months.
In July, Bulgaria&#39;s national statistics showed 1% monthly inflation.
This is the highest indicator since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since October last year, when it was positive (0.2%).
Annual average inflation according to CPI, in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to the previous year was 101.9% and the monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
Year-to-date inflation was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); for housing equipment, household appliances and regular house cleaning (0.5%); for health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month&#39;s level for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other types of fuel, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankiewicz: The time is coming, and the truth will rise.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, Metropolitan Zbigņevs Stankevičs, in an interview with the Independent, emphasizes that if we want to gain strength in life, we must put the message of the Gospel at its center.
Because the power of truth is greater than the evilness of evil.
Many are already on their way to the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will the believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the papal nuncio has expressed his desire to lead the main service in Aglona.
Therefore, the content of the main message is also up to him.
The fact that Bishop Jānis Bulis leads the Way of the Cross has also turned into a kind of tradition.
He will also create his own message.
I lead the holiday vigil service the day before.
Last year, I turned to the encyclical of Pope Francis &quot;Laudato si&quot; and updated the theme of the common house, the Earth, in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I&#39;m watching what&#39;s happening in the world and I&#39;m trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with what the church recommends, that the Gospel message should be placed at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for a further path.
Then it appeals to people.
But in Cēsis, in Lampa&#39;s discussion, you said that &quot;we must return to the understanding of the complete person&quot;.
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church today have the resource for such conversion?
A dying man was robbed on the side of the road in the capital of India.
In the capital of India, no one seems to know about a man who was knocked down and dying on the side of the road - it turns out that he was lying on the side of the road for an hour and then he was robbed, the BBC informs.
The man, identified as Matibool, reportedly drove a rickshaw during the day and worked as a security guard at night.
Matibul was walking home on the road at 5:30 in the morning when he was hit by a car.
The recording of the surveillance cameras shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then drove away.
An hour later, when no one seemed to know about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a thug.
About 90 minutes after the crash, the police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died from his injuries.
By withdrawing her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, has saved the government from falling, believes Ojārs Skudra, associate professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kolegova&#39;s explanation for withdrawing her candidacy due to contradictions in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with LETA agency, Sudra said that it is difficult for him to imagine that &quot;Vienotība&quot; would support Kolegova&#39;s candidacy at the next week&#39;s government meeting.
Therefore, if the ministers of &quot;Unity&quot; voted against, but still confirmed Kolegova, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
Also, the expert believes that before announcing the withdrawal of her candidacy, Kolegova consulted both Finance Minister Dana Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mari Kučinski.
At the same time, it is said to be a concession to &quot;Unity&quot;, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
Predicting whether it will be possible to find a suitable candidate through the competition, Skudra admitted that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be selected, or Dace Pelekas will continue to lead the institution as acting general director.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has claimed until now that no other candidacy is being considered, this is a hint to Pelekaya that she should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the head of the State Environmental Service, Kolegova, has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the position of Director General of the SRS.
Due to the objections of &quot;Vienotības&quot;, the government on Tuesday postponed the approval of Kolegova for the post of General Director of the SRS for a week.
After the government&#39;s decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova assured that she is still ready to become the head of the SRS.
However, she later changed her mind - in her submission to Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola on Friday, she states that she is withdrawing her consent to the transfer to the position of head of the SRS and that this is not an easy choice for her.
Andrejs Vaivars, the press secretary of Prime Minister Māras Kučinskas, explained to the LETA agency that a new competition will be held for the vacant position of Director General of the SRS.
An accident involving a police car took place in the center of Riga.
A road traffic accident involving a State Police car took place in the center of Riga this afternoon.
A police car with sound and light signals on rushed to the highest category call until it collided with another car at the intersection of Krišjāņa Barona and Dzirnavu streets.
The police are explaining the circumstances of the incident, but preliminary information shows that the other vehicle did not miss the police car.
A woman was injured in the accident.
This year, the population of Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year, Riga had 638,784 inhabitants, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641,000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, LETA was informed by the Central Statistics Office (CSB).
On the other hand, in terms of the number of inhabitants, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with a population exceeding one million.
According to the data of the EU statistical office &quot;Eurostat&quot;, Riga has the largest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is confidently in the first place among the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic states have the highest proportion of women in Europe&#39;s largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123, and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed at LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed near the Latvian National Art Museum (LNMM), Baiba Gailīte, representative of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, told LETA.
Currently, the repair of damage to the glass atrium of the museum, which was caused by skateboarders, has been successfully completed.
Warning pictograms will be placed near it in the coming days.
Its residents will be told that the surface is slippery during rain and snow, it is not allowed to move on it with cars, as well as ride bicycles, roller skates and skateboards.
At that time, Ushakov also wrote about this on the Facebook social network, who stated that the damage does not pose any safety risks, but &quot;looks sloppy&quot;, and the skateboarders &quot;will have to be chased&quot;.
Holidays for children and parents - new children&#39;s playgrounds have been installed in Riga.
In this summer season, the Riga municipality has even installed two new playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkaln, which are already available for children.
A wide, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, tubes and slides is installed on the beach of Ķīpsala.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
There are also swings and various balancing elements installed in the square.
The fantasy world for little sailors is enhanced by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
On the other hand, in the playground between the 4th and 5th cross lines of Čiekurkalns, there is a playhouse, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other game elements, as well as an exercise area with rings for strength and coordination training, side streams and other sports elements.
A rubber covering in different colors is laid under the court.
A new, colorful pavement has been laid up to the playground from the side of the street.
The reconstructed section of the road has been opened in Medumi.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvijas Valsts ceļi (LVC), as well as representatives of builders SIA &quot;Binders&quot; and representatives of local governments, today opened the reconstructed section of the main state highway Russian border (Grebņeva) - Rēzekne - Daugavpils - Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km).
Roads are the calling card of the country, especially the border roads, so it is a special satisfaction to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the country&#39;s main highways is improving.
&quot;According to the forecasts, the funds available for roads during this planning period will be used up already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue to maintain the busiest roads in very good quality, and also ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding&quot;, he emphasized while cutting the symbolic ribbon Uldis Augulis.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
Construction works on the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (km 156.4-163.05) were started by SIA Binders last year and continued this year after a technological break.
The cost of the reconstruction is 13.5 million euros (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
&quot;In the reconstructed section of the road, the structure of the road has been completely restored and next year, repair work will begin on the next section from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, thus the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be repaired&quot;, informed Jānis Lange, chairman of the board of LVC.
The country&#39;s main highways are the most congested, and by 2018 we plan to have all the country&#39;s main roads in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, providing timely periodic maintenance and replacing the asphalt top layer every 7-9 years.
&quot;This, of course, will require adequate funding, and all road users are looking forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system,&quot; noted Lange.
As part of the project, road connections and lighting in the center of Medumu have been arranged.
Considerable earthworks have been carried out: four stages of large-scale desalination and extensive trenching and embankment works, the longitudinal profile of the road, which was very uneven until now, has been leveled.
Public transport stops have also been renovated and a turning area for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient bearing capacity and the terrain of the area was not transparent due to hilly valleys, and the old road copied the terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the road section from the Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (km 144.80-156.40).
This year, LVC plans to perform various types of work on more than 1,100 kilometers of national roads.
Information about all the repair works planned this year in the national road network is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
&quot;To achieve the desired weight loss results, the correct choice of food product combinations is very important,&quot; admits Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
Moreover, it is easy to do during the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A judicious combination of nutritional products can help not only to reduce excess weight, but also to promote various body processes in a targeted manner.
Macaroni and vinegar are a winning combination because they provide long-lasting satiety and help fight fat.
Research published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel alert.
Cayenne pepper and a protein-rich food, such as poultry or a protein shake, not only make you feel full, but also reduce cravings for large meals at subsequent meals.
Such a combination of foods can increase the amount of calories burned even after a meal by up to 35%.
Research shows that cayenne pepper can help get rid of belly fat.
Eggs contain the metabolism-boosting nutrient choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Adequate intake of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels, which in turn reduces fat accumulation around the midsection.
Oatmeal with fresh berries is another delicious and fat-burning breakfast meal worth adding to your menu.
Oatmeal and berries contain fiber, which, according to Canadian scientists, controls ghrelin - the appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus the feeling of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which help in weight loss and also prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and protein can also work wonders for weight loss.
Such a combination can create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they promote satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestion process and ensure a feeling of satiety for a longer time.
For lunch, you can eat chicken with a salad or make a protein shake from the ready mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What product combinations to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch found in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Fruits break down mechanically in the stomach, while they do not break down chemically until they reach the third or fourth stage of digestion, which takes place in the intestines.
Starch breaks down into three different stages that begin in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
Eating sweet food right after a meal gets it &quot;trapped&quot; in the stomach with other food, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates, or other carbohydrate-containing foods with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples, or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, which is present in saliva, only works in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs, or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk, or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich foods at the same meal.
Different digestive juices are needed to process them, each with different strength, characteristics and time to reach the stomach.
Watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat makes a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said for fat and protein - fat inhibits protein digestion.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid the use of fat altogether.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains protein) with a whole avocado (contains fat).
Such a combination hinders effective weight loss.
How to cook better?
&quot;Cooking food, heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - approximately 15% to 55% of the original nutrient content of the products,&quot; says the nutritionist.
In most cases, nutrients are lost when food is boiled in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods is enhanced by direct cooking.
After cooking the vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid to make soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you can eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables by steaming them as well.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
Boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes increases the amount of lycopene by 25%.
Heat treatment also greatly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
Similarly, heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to be absorbed by the body.
It should also be kept in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, but freezing does not affect fiber.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the absorption of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-hematopoietic iron, found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products, than hematopoietic iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can greatly increase your body&#39;s absorption of non-hematopoietic iron by eating foods containing non-hematopoietic iron along with sources of vitamin C, such as oranges, tomatoes, and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-blood-forming iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which ensures the delivery of oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of your salad, add healthy fats like olive or flaxseed oil.
When making salmon sandwiches, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines to plain yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestines and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grains) along with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels as well as prevent clogging of the arteries.
Snapchat&#39;s &quot;Anime&quot; effect is criticized for caricaturing Asians
Snapchat officials say the filter was inspired by the animation, but some commenters say it&#39;s racially insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows its 150 million users to alter reality and play with their identity in an absurd way every day.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that would fit in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are nebulous, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million altered selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public.
Snapchat&#39;s lens effects have been criticized in the past, with accusations that the app promotes skin tones that are too dark or too light as the standard of ideal beauty.
The new lens effects, which allow users to create crooked eyes, crooked teeth and round cheeks, were released this week, with some critics calling it a racist caricature of Asians - the &quot;yellow face&quot;.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has bigger problems with diversity.
The news and public backlash erupted on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard reported that lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the purpose of the lens is to represent Anime characters, not to caricature people of Asian descent.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the resemblance to Anime.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani&#39;s Twitter post about the images went viral. In an email, she says the lens effects are &quot;offensive and embarrassing, to say the least.&quot;
She added that it&#39;s hard not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian caricatures and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not simply yellow face, but yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat isn&#39;t the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also engaged in a never-ending battle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood to the devices we use every day.
And Snapchat&#39;s large, racially diverse youth audience, unlike its older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, &quot;things like this don&#39;t go unnoticed these days,&quot; 25-year-old Katie Zhou said in an interview on Thursday.
Zhou, product manager at Medium, deleted her Snapchat app on Thursday and advised others to do the same.
In her Medium article and in a phone interview, she explained that she believes issues related to race stem from Snapchat&#39;s employment policies that don&#39;t support racial diversity enough.
Zhou criticized the company&#39;s predominantly white male leadership and then ended his article with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
&quot;It means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so these decisions are made. Are there some people of other races working in the company, but they are not in a position where they can safely and comfortably express their opinion,&quot; says Chinese-American Zhou.
Others agree with her, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are racially diverse, saying it is a privately held company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the backgrounds of its employees, but a spokesperson revealed that the company has hired an HR specialist who will focus on bringing underrepresented racial minorities to the company and promoting inclusion.
Zhou, on the other hand, will not update his Snapchat account, adding: &quot;I wonder if they really need more users like us to realize that this is wrong.&quot;
House of Congress says military officials distorted reports on Islamic State.
In a statement issued Thursday, the House of Congress says that representatives of the US Central Command have distorted reports, portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as more optimistic than it actually is.
Central Command intelligence analysts expressed widespread dismay at the interim report from a task force created by Republican representatives of the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, saying their leadership controlled reports on American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida that oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on the report is that intelligence reports approved by high-ranking Centcom executives paint a more positive picture of the US fight against terrorism than it actually is. The facts were routinely distorted to portray a better performance than other intelligence analyses.
Rep. Ken Calvert, Republican of California, said: &quot;Centcom&#39;s actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policymakers receive false information.&quot;
Centcom&#39;s management mistakes can be traced back to the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report details problems in Central Command&#39;s coverage and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be distorted, it does suggest that Centcom management exerted some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration&#39;s press releases, announcements and reports to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly announced that the operation to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq&#39;s second largest city still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, a spokesman for the Kansas Republican Party, said in a report: &quot;A months-long investigation makes this clear.&quot;
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, key US Central Command officials distorted reports to portray the ISIS threat in Iraq as weaker than it actually was.
The Republican Party created the task force after learning that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being distorted.
Thursday&#39;s report will follow new findings in the case as the investigation continues.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defense is conducting an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The Democratic members of the Intelligence Management Committee released their own report Thursday, in which they agree with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat, said in his report that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom excessively restricted the preparation of intelligence assessment reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that the process &quot;stopped the flow of information,&quot; undermined analysts&#39; work ethics, and &quot;proliferated false facts.&quot;
But Schiff and fellow Democrats added that there was no evidence that the White House had pressured Centcom analysts to produce reports in line with a &quot;predetermined or political position.&quot;
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report pending an investigation.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defense and the Intelligence Agency call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The inquiry is not limited to whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (a claim made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
But last year&#39;s allegations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Command about military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence echoes more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker released a study alleging that the George W. Bush administration launched the war in Afghanistan with too little thought for its potential consequences.
Hooker also played a major role in uncovering the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, officials reported that Hooker&#39;s team had found that, contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State oil facilities had not significantly dented the terrorist group&#39;s financial position because they had built makeshift factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in its September edition that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Administration.
The commander of Centcom at the time, General Lloyd Austin III, received sharp criticism because many law makers believed that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the duel with Great Britain in women&#39;s field hockey, the USA wins, thus achieving its fourth victory in a row.
A day after a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the US women&#39;s field hockey team in a 3-0 win over India on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bama said she couldn&#39;t remember if she had ever done it before.
She said, &quot;I have no idea.&quot;
I&#39;m not one of those people who count their goals.
But she knows the Americans are 4-0 at the Olympics, which ties them in their group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States meet on Saturday for the final match of the first round of games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will only determine which team will finish first in the six-team group and which will finish second.
The winner of the first place will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch national team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
However Saturday&#39;s game unfolds, the Americans have already caused a flurry of surprises by finishing last among 12 teams in London four years ago.
Bama was also on that team
She grew up in Bluebell, picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at age 3 (her older twin sisters were already playing the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming the youngest player in the team&#39;s history.
She didn&#39;t make it to the 2008 Olympics because she didn&#39;t make it to the finals.
However, 2012 was unsuccessful for her and her team.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parham was appointed as the coach of the national team and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it a &quot;cultural, mental and physical change.&quot;
In London we didn&#39;t put in as much work as we do now.
We have changed absolutely everything.
Bama opened the scoring in Thursday&#39;s game, scoring in the first half with a behind-the-back shot from close range.
India started the game without a win on their account, but their team was very fierce and kept the score to a minimum of 0-1 until the end of the third period when Bama scored again.
She drove the ball into the opponent&#39;s zone on the left side of the court, then managed to get to the middle of the court and send the ball into the opponent&#39;s goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored another goal midway through the fourth period.
It was the first dry game for USA goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had conceded one goal in each of her first three games.
She has run in.
And so is Bama.
&quot;We&#39;re doing really well right now,&quot; Paham said, but Saturday&#39;s game will show just how well.
The most depressing food of the depression period is the &quot;Heavy Meal&quot;
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to a meal in the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt enjoyed fine culinary delicacies such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
However, that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding for dessert.
Jane Ziegelman says, &quot;It&#39;s a way of showing solidarity in cooking with people who have had a really hard time.&quot;
Adds her husband, Andrew Coe, &quot;It&#39;s also a message to Americans about how to eat.&quot;
A couple from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Kou&#39;s latest book &quot;Vegetable Stew&quot; describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane in her book &quot;97 Apples&quot; describes life through food in a tenement house on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
Their new joint effort, &quot;The Hearty Meal,&quot; to be published Tuesday by Harper&#39;s, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity, they dined together with the reporter at Eisenberg&#39;s Sandwich Shop, a casual diner in the Flatirons that has been open since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
Mrs. Ziegelmanes, 54, ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while Kou, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable salad.
When the reporter ordered the fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about Great Depression-era food.
Ms. Ziegelman said the fake bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny, and a bean bunny.
They were made from a basic ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it&#39;s like to eat enough peanuts for lunch.
Mr. Kou was startled.
&quot;It must have felt like a stomach full of lead,&quot; he added.
In the pre-Depression years, the American dinner table resembled a Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women cooked for their laborer husbands and freshly prepared concoctions were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to the Europeans. &quot;The Hearty Meal&quot; describes how Americans adapted to the conditions when America was suddenly no longer a land of plenty.
&quot;At that time, food became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis,&quot; says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this particular topic.
Equally important were the new budget diets: unknown dishes like fake hare and stews became commonplace, stews were &quot;a great way to use up leftovers,&quot; noted Ms. Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unappealing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which had been a staple of American meals for years, now became an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, never-before-seen creations were born.
In an old cookbook, Ms. Ziegelman found a recipe for peanut butter-stuffed onions.
Mr Kou adds: &quot;It was not a popular addition to the dinner table.&quot;
Ms. Ziegelman emphasizes: &quot;It was surreal.&quot;
Peanut butter and fried onion do not go together.
Many home cooking recipes adapted to the hard times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, defined national eating patterns not seen before or since the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become &quot;economists&quot; and take on challenges such as turning a pasta and carrot mixture into a tasty meal.
&quot;Heavy Meal&quot; is a feast of historical delicacies.
Of particular interest are the testimonies of the government&#39;s attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover&#39;s &quot;let me eat cake&quot; attitude.
Although in public he talked about his simple childhood and dining in Iowa, in reality he ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr. Kou says: &quot;He liked European cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce.&quot;
He ate in an almost gilded drawing room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn&#39;t advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book says that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who couldn&#39;t cook, so the White House became a place &quot;where not only was one of the most unappetizing meals served in Washington, but also the worst prepared meals.&quot;
As the nation&#39;s economy recovered, most Depression-era culinary customs disappeared.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, and how to apply science to cooking, Ms. Ziegelman added.
The couple say that writing the book gave them a better understanding of Ms. Ziegelman&#39;s mother&#39;s eating habits, such as why she couldn&#39;t throw away food.
&quot;She was really afraid to throw the food out,&quot; Mr Kou said.
Ms. Ziegelman said, &quot;She was actually driving people crazy.&quot;
Once there was an incident with wind cakes.
After we ate at Eisenberg&#39;s, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert out of their bag: the plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
&quot;It&#39;s plum whipped cream,&quot; Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that it was common at the time to give modest dishes a fancy name.
It has no whipped cream, just prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone eagerly dipped their spoons into the brown mass on their plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn&#39;t that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced &quot;economist,&quot; he told his wife, &quot;A pinch of ground hazelnuts would do.&quot;
Gilead to be reimbursed for legal fees in battle with Merck over Hepatitis C patent
A district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to receive back the legal fees it paid in the Hepatitis C patent infringement case against the pharmaceutical company &quot;Merck &amp; Co Inc.&quot;
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a 200 million pound fine for infringing two Merck patents it faced over its successful Sovaldi and Harvoni pills, when a US federal judge found irregularities at Merck, such as lying under oath and other unethical practices.
At a hearing on Thursday, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that Gilead is entitled to seek reimbursement for legal expenses it has incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain ground against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case began back in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to gain ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient in Gilead&#39;s drug.
US-backed forces say they have taken full control of the city of Manbij from Islamic State.
US-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State fighters have left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are currently clearing the city of the last remaining opposition fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages taken by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
&quot;At the moment, the city is under our complete control and we are searching for the militants,&quot; he told Reuters.
The Clintons&#39; income in 2015 reached 10.75 million dollars and the couple paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earned $10.75 million that year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, the Clintons have donated $1 million, mostly to their Clinton Charities. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million from speaking engagements, and the former secretary of state earned $3 million from her book about her work at the State Department, published in partnership with Simon &amp; Schuster.
Clinton&#39;s election ally - US Virginia state senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anna Holton have released their tax returns for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set new standards for financial transparency,&quot; Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump hides behind various pretexts and excuses in order not to fulfill his promises to reveal his tax information.
It is a practice of record for US presidential candidates to release tax information, but it is not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cite an Internal Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
&quot;Your move,&quot; Clinton&#39;s campaign partner Ian Sam said in his Twitter post about the Democratic candidate&#39;s tax information.
On Thursday, Trump&#39;s special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audits were completed.
Trump&#39;s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, say his recusal raises questions about the true extent of his assets, donation amounts and other business dealings, including ties to Russia.
Clinton added fuel to the fire by releasing a video Friday of several influential Republicans demanding Trump release his tax information.
She returned to the issue again during an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the crowd, &quot;He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have done for decades.&quot;
Politico reports that Trump paid very little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, a New York Times business columnist reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a major issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, supporting billionaire Warren Buffett&#39;s proposal, is promoting the idea that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
During Clinton&#39;s appearance last week in Omaha, Nebraska, where his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based, Buffett invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he too is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service and that Trump is afraid of the voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has released tax information going back to 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chappaqua, New York, and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons&#39; 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons have received $109,000 in dividends.

A Jewish film director criticizes a hotel in Berlin for turning off the Israeli long-distance code at the request of an Arab - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin caused a storm on social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli long-distance code. Hotel staff base this on the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the director of the Holocaust documentary &quot;Shoah&quot;, did not hide his dissatisfaction with Berlin&#39;s Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lanzman tried to find the long-distance code for Israel on a list provided by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been swept away and destroyed?
Written by Lanzmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director demanded an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lanzman writes that the response he received &quot;shocked him&quot;.
The hotel administrator explained that &quot;it is a deliberate decision of the hotel management&quot;.
The reason for the removal of the code further angered the film director.
&quot;Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be erased,&quot; Lanzmann quoted a hotel employee as explaining.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that Israel&#39;s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsmann, called this case a &quot;great shame&quot;.
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that it happened in Germany, in this hotel chain, is an even greater humiliation.
No explanation is necessary.
The official said: &quot;We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusions.&quot;
This event also received quite wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the &quot;Kempinski&quot; hotel simply indulged its Arab customers.
Another post said &quot;shame on you&quot;, pointing out that the hotel is on the Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all accusations, declaring that it was all a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and apologized to Lanzmann.
&quot;We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers,&quot; the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski spokesman as saying.
And adds that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashed on Thursday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government reforms to the education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The trouble started when the law enforcement officers tried to expel the students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin&#39;s proposal calls for the closure of nearly 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be moved to other schools in an effort to save money.
Some demonstrators painted graffiti on the walls with messages against interim president Michael Temer.
This protest came just days after a previous protest where students gathered in demonstrations to show support for ousted president Dilma Rousseff, who was voted to impeach by the senate.
Scott Kellum Skinner finishes first to bring Great Britain a gold medal in cycling
Calum Skinner of Scotland finished first in the men&#39;s cycling team sprint race at the Rio Velodrome last night. The British team defended its championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow played an important role in the race, making legendary Scot Sir Chris Hoy proud and giving victory to favorites New Zealand.
Four years ago, Great Britain scored a surprise victory as Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy had already finished his sports career.
There were problems in the stretch between the Beijing and London Olympics, as experienced starter Jamie Staff had to be replaced.
They managed it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton looked to fill his place.
British coaches had high hopes for Skinner, seeing potential in him, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who raced with Hoy and Skinner four years ago, who set the Olympic qualifying record, but the New Zealand team had a better start to the race
However, the British trio won the gold medals.
Hindes was in close pursuit after his lap, Kenny took the lead and Skinner maintained that lead.
A change of strategy played an important part in the win as Hindes drove in a higher gear to allow Kenny and especially Skinner to go faster.
Hoy was watching the race for the BBC and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
The 23-year-old from Glaswegian said: &quot;It was an indescribable honour.&quot;
I do everything to defend my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and beat the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenny and Hoya at the 2012 London Olympics, Hindes admitted she fell on the track on purpose after a poor start.
He later refuted this comment and the British rivals had no power to prove otherwise.
This time there were no such incidents.
Hindes said: &quot;The British flags in the stands reminded me of London.&quot;
Over the past 3 months, we have become a tight-knit team.
We&#39;ve lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal in the race for the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is any indication of the team&#39;s progress over the past five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenny&#39;s result, he could indeed repeat Hoy&#39;s success of three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, it would mean six gold medals and one silver. Also, Kenny was also born on March 23rd (which appears to be a British holy date as Steve Ragrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on this day).
Hoy is also born on this date.
Kenny&#39;s next race is the sprint, which starts today and continues for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I&#39;m just enjoying it all at the moment.
A team ride is always the best.
Because then you can win together with your teammates.
To be honest, winning alone is a bit lonely.&quot;
Hindes said: &quot;If he wins two more gold medals he should be knighted.&quot;
That was the only medal battle on the day, but it wasn&#39;t the only good news for Great Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Owain Dole set the fastest qualifying time in the four kilometer pursuit for four.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, which was set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place in the second half of the day today, where Wiggins is sure to be in the spotlight.
He had a falling out with the commissariat yesterday before the qualifying run when the judges called him out to measure his height.
In the women&#39;s race, which continues and concludes today, Milngavie&#39;s Laura Trott, Joanne Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hoping. will win medals in the middle stage of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
Meanwhile, things have been going on behind the scenes, with technical director Shane Sutton stepping down after accusations of sexism and defamation, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also retiring.
But as the first velodrome race begins, it seems that the British will, as always, reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of a Portland smelter is becoming uncertain as a major contract is terminated.
The future of an aluminum smelter and hundreds of its workers in Portland, Victoria has become uncertain after its main customer, an energy company, announced the termination of cooperation.
The announcement follows plans by the Victorian Government to end subsidies to the energy company, which are vital to the company&#39;s continued operation.
The 20-year subsidies will end in November.
As a result, more than 2,000 jobs at Alcoa&#39;s Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria&#39;s entire electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, leading to the shutdown of the Anglesea power station.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland smelter is running at a loss and may close.
These developments were triggered by years of speculation about the appreciation of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory output.
The plant&#39;s energy supplier AGL, which supplies power from its Loy Yang A power station in the Latrobe Valley, says the other three owners are also likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plant belongs to the joint venture &quot;Alcoa&quot; and &quot;Alumia&quot;, in addition, the holding companies of China &quot;CITIC&quot; and Japan &quot;Marubeni Corp&quot; also own parts of the company.
&quot;AGL&quot; hopes to continue the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supplies to the smelter,&quot; said its representative.
&quot;AGL&quot; said that the contracts are so-called &quot;risk limiting contracts&quot;, which are expected to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a validity period of 12 months, so they will be valid until 2017.
&quot;AGL&quot; plans to receive revenues from these contracts in the 2017 fiscal year as well,&quot; said the company&#39;s representative.
Starting from fiscal year 2018, the possible impact on earnings is limited by favorable market forecasts regarding future wholesale electricity prices.
&quot;AGL&quot; claims that it has already calculated losses in the amount of 187 million dollars in its forecasts, anticipating that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa&#39;s ability to continue operating the smelter or supply it with energy.
The US company says that in 2010 it signed a contract with &quot;Loy Yang&quot; for 20 years, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide an explanation as to why it will stop cooperation.
Analysts have raised concerns over both the potential closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry&#39;s weak economy.
AGL CEO Steven Mickelson said last week that analysts estimate Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these factories were to leave the energy market, energy demand would decrease significantly.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community Legal Center turns away 160,000 people each year.
More than 160,000 people&#39;s claims are rejected each year, and with budget cuts, the situation could get worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of abuse and those without the means to fight evictions - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community Legal Centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only get worse as funding cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers will receive 30% less funding than before.
Legal Center Queensland director James Farrell said the latest report from the National Association of Legal Centers said thousands of people in need were being denied legal aid.
Mr Farrell said if this decision was not reversed, the situation would only get worse.
He also says: &quot;Queensland Legal Center is consistently underfunded, meaning help is being denied to thousands of people who need it.&quot;
People trying to end abusive relationships, people in deep debt, families going through divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands more Queenslanders will have to deal with their complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney-General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately stop the funding cuts so that people who need legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to bring legal aid levels up to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and for the Palazczuk government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump&#39;s campaign is being sued because one of its employees pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump&#39;s campaign organizers are being sued for failing to act after receiving reports that its North Carolina operations manager pointed a gun at a staffer while they were riding in the same car in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a Charlotte court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months for an internal review of the case to begin, only to realize it would not happen.
The manager, Earl Phillips, &quot;pulled out a handgun, put his right index finger on the cock and pointed the barrel at Vincent&#39;s knee,&quot; Bordini alleges in his complaint.
He also claims that after filing complaints with local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing.
&quot;Guns do not need to fire to cause damage,&quot; Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was filed, the Republican presidential nominee caused a stir by telling people that &quot;Second Amendment people,&quot; ie gun owners and enthusiasts, could act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, won the election and she elected judges.
Trump&#39;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had never incited violence against anyone.
With his lawsuit, Bordini wants to recover compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent supervision, and from Phillips - for assault, unlawful use of a weapon and causing emotional stress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks had no immediate comment.
Phillips could not be reached.
WCCB - Charlotte&#39;s local news outlet reports that Phillips recently left the campaign.
It was also not possible to call his consulting firm &quot;Inovativie Konsultasi Palpaljomi&quot;.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - a parish and sports festival in Kūlciem.
On Saturday, for the first time in Kūlciem, people gathered for the parish and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that there will be no more Lake Festival.
A new page has been turned.
The day started with a sports competition.
This time, the competition was not in traditional ways and was not taken too seriously, because, for example, darts had to be thrown at a lying target, a boot flew, thrown with a person&#39;s left hand, &quot;bubble&quot; has never been in any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, brave, agile and resourceful he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered at the outdoor stage, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a &quot;children&#39;s corner&quot; where the little ones could play on the inflatable attractions and get a new face in the make-up shop.
The novelty, which could also become a tradition, was a vehicle parade, in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
Everyone was addressed by Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, head of the Ķūlciem parish administration, who wished them a nice rest and dry weather, although the rain poured down, but it could not disturb anything.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the youngest residents of Kūlciem.
It is really good that the parish has added five girls and one boy.
Amateur art collectives from Engure region came to Kūlciemni with performances - the audience really liked the performances of senior dance group &quot;Rudens ritmi&quot;, &quot;Redas&quot; of various folk dance performers, and &quot;Zelta pärles&quot; of young dancers.
And it doesn&#39;t matter that someone also happened to slip on the wet stage.
Of course, local people and visitors were delighted by the famous acting duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Bērzciems from the fishing farm &quot;Dieniņas&quot;.
The ball was played by the group &quot;Brugis&quot;.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local areas and London, but across the country as well.
This, I think, makes Heathrow very attractive, just like in London in 2012, where we put in a huge amount of work to ensure that all regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and the East End gained enormously from the Olympics.
And we will do it again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As with the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people who think the challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics in time and that it would be a global failure.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012 and they will not be right in the case of Heathrow either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome them so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180,000 new jobs, an economic boost of £211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
Heathrow has a great team that has delivered an £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, from Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world five years in a row, to Terminal 2, built between the two most intensively used runways in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London 2012 Olympics were a great success and I&#39;m sure the Heathrow expansion will be as well.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is a board member of Heathrow and former business secretary at the Ministry of the Economy.
In Switzerland, a woman runs onto the highway in an attempt to commit suicide.
The victim lay down on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when she was run over by several cars on the highway early Thursday morning.
The accident happened shortly after midnight on Thursday on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vaud.
A police report from the Canton of Vaux said that in a desperate attempt to commit suicide, the woman had laid down on the road in the dark where she was run over by several cars.
While clearly trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss man, was hit by several cars, including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already given statements, but others involved have yet to be identified, say the police, who are appealing to the drivers involved and witnesses to the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has also been launched into the case, which is a logical step in such a case, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was the collision avoidable?
Hofsteller adds: &quot;That will be determined by the prosecutor.&quot;
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be prosecuted.
In both cases, the pedestrian had walked onto the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that the drivers could not foresee that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of manslaughter when she ran over a man who was sleeping on the A1 near Payjerne in the middle of the night in August 2014.
The court found out that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later fell asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman who was on her way to the scene of the accident was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances, and the judge recognized that the sleeping man on the road was a &quot;completely unpredictable and extraordinary case&quot;.
Anyone with information about Thursday&#39;s accident near Morges is urged to contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are being collected on the Internet for holding a competition for the position of the head of the SRS.
The petition portal &quot;Avaaz.org&quot; has started collecting signatures for holding a competition for the position of the head of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition, which is addressed to the ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), states that the public wants a transparent and professional nomination process for officials.
The petition was created on August 10, and it is currently signed by 55 people.
The nomination process of Inga Kolegova, an applicant for the post of General Director of the SRS, is non-transparent and unprofessional.
It recalls the best traditions of the functionaries of the Soviet Union.
It discredits the public administration and once again makes the public disappointed in the government and politicians.
&quot;There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated,&quot; reads the text of the petition.
Its author, Jānis B., stated that the public does not know the criteria by which Kolegova was chosen for the position.
It is also not clear what the candidate&#39;s intentions are in the SRS job.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery should create a new, open competition, in which professional candidates are actively approached, personnel selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Last week, Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially nominated Kolegova for the position of head of the SRS, this week the government was supposed to approve him in the new position, but all the ministers of the &quot;Unity&quot; party voted against, so the issue was postponed for a week.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played badly.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš hoped for an award at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, if they did not get it, there is no difference in which place to end the competition, Samoilovs said after withdrawing from the tournament.
One of the world&#39;s strongest beach volleyball pairs lost 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) to the Brazilians Evandra Gonsalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgada in the final and decisive match of the subgroup tournament on Thursday, concluding their participation in the most important sports forum of the quadrennial.
In the three matches of the subgroup, Latvian athletes scored one victory, but two more pairs had the same ratio.
In the continuation, the ratio of small points between the three pairs was counted, which after the convincing loss suffered in this match was the most unfavorable for the Latvian duo.
&quot;We were in the lead in the first set, but from 16:15 we remained at 16 points&quot;, recalled Šmēdins.
I don&#39;t even know how we stayed scoreless for the rest of the set.
You can&#39;t play like that.
After that, everything was fine in the second set and they managed to break the game at the end of the set, and it should have been a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it the same way, but after we switched sides, the score increased for only one team.
We had too many errors in attack.
In the subgroup, all the teams were similar, almost all matches went to three sets, so the small points were important.
&quot;We should have played more similarly, instead of repeatedly giving up 3-4 points in a row&quot;, said the athlete.
We knew that Evandra could be served.
&quot;We managed it in the first set, in the second we scored 1-2 points, but in the third at +4, he lost the game&quot;, remembered Šmēdins.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it worked, sometimes not.
I did not look at the standings before the match, but it was known that we needed as many small points as possible.
&quot;If we lost, then I played badly&quot;, said Samoilov.
We expected a good serve from Evandru and we handled it quite well in the first sets, but in the third his serve opened up and it was difficult to form an attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistakes in reception right at Pedro&#39;s serve, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, the athletes were not nervous today.
&quot;We went, we played, the defense was also there, but we needed a better reception of the serve&quot;, said the athlete.
&quot;They played well and at the end it was already a &quot;hooray&quot;&quot;.
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most inconvenient that could have been.
We had a chance to fight for first place as well, but we didn&#39;t even get out of the group.
&quot;Everyone expected a medal from us and we also expected from ourselves, but after that there is no difference - 25th place or fourth&quot;, said Samoilovs, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
In Rio de Janeiro, Samoilov already had the third Olympic Games in his career, because in 2008 in Beijing he competed together with Mārtis Pļaviņas, but four years ago he played together with Ruslan Sorokina in London.
Meanwhile, this was the second start at the Olympics for Šmēdiņš.
&quot;Latvenergo&quot; follows the gas market opening process also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company &quot;Latvenergo&quot; follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of both a consumer and a potential trader, said the company&#39;s press secretary Ivita Bidere.
&quot;The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by what gas market model and legal regulation will be created.&quot;
&quot;That is why we are actively involved in the creation and commenting of regulatory acts, as well as submitting our proposals&quot;, said Bidere.
Agency BNS already wrote that the Ministry of Economy (ME) in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and energy company &quot;Latvijas Gāze&quot; has developed the Cabinet of Ministers&#39; draft &quot;Regulations on the sale and use of natural gas&quot; which will change the existing operating principles of the natural gas market, from April 3, 2017 providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas trader.
Working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the goal of EM is to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, the &quot;dealer-centric model&quot; was chosen as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, in which all actions related to customer service are provided by the dealer - one contract, one invoice and one place for providing information and customer service, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the discretion of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently implemented in electricity trading.
We remind you that a gradual opening of the market is planned for household users - even after April 3, 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming connected users.
&quot;In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is determined by the public trader&quot;, informed the ministry.
On the other hand, merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader, with whom a natural gas sales contract must be concluded.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, natural gas trade will be provided by the current natural gas trader at the price determined by the natural gas trader for a certain period of time.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers stipulate in detail the rights and obligations of natural gas traders, system operators and users.
The rules determine the procedure for supplying natural gas to users and interrupting its supply, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, public trader, system operator, user and the owner of the gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedure for making payments for the services received, the amount of late payment interest, the procedure for changing traders and the supply of users in the event of natural gas supply disruptions; procedure by which natural gas supply to related users is provided by the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to discuss the increase of the salary of the Director General of the SRS.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens and Farmers&#39; Union (ZZS)) plans next week to talk with Prime Minister Māri Kučinski (ZZS) and government coalition partners about increasing the salary of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
Reizniece-Ozola told journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing the salary of the Director General of the SRS must be resolved urgently in order to make this position more attractive to possible applicants for the repeated competition.
Also, next week there will be talk about changing the conditions of the competition.
The minister also emphasized that she does not have a specific candidate in mind to apply for the vacant position.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, would have been a good director general of the SRS.
On the other hand, regarding the current acting head of the SRS, Daci Pelēko, who has expressed her readiness to apply for this position, the minister repeatedly expressed the opinion that the new director general of the SRS should have an &quot;outside view&quot; and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also emphasized that she is waiting for the Saeima to return from vacation in order to advance the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganization of the SRS as soon as possible.
Agency BNS already reported that the head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, has submitted an application to Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), in which she withdraws her candidacy for the position of Director General of the SRS.
In the submission, she expressed that it was not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks, her loved ones have experienced serious emotional pressure, although they have not committed any acts that are punishable by law.
Kolegova also stated that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition, which is also unacceptable.
It was also reported that the previous director general of the SRS, Ināra Pētersone, left her post at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; Stock indexes in the US and Europe are rising, as is the value of the US dollar.
Global oil prices continued to rise on Friday morning, with investor sentiment positively influenced by Saudi Arabia&#39;s oil minister&#39;s remarks, which boosted expectations that major oil producing countries will take action to stabilize the global oil market at the September OPEC meeting.
The three main US stock market indices reached record highs on Thursday, which had not been seen since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the increase in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in the price of oil and strong financial indicators of several companies were also the reason for the rise in European stock market indices on Thursday.
The US dollar rose against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen on Thursday.
WTI crude for September delivery rose $1.78 to $43.49 a barrel on Thursday in electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The price of &quot;Brent&quot; crude oil for delivery in October on the London Stock Exchange increased by 1.99 dollars - up to 46.04 dollars per barrel.
The turnover of canned food producer &quot;Zilā lagūna&quot; decreased by 33.8% last year.
The turnover of canned food producer &quot;Zilā lagūna&quot; last year was 4.202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year earlier, while the company&#39;s losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial statements published in the &quot;Lursoft&quot; database overview.
The report of the company&#39;s management states that in 2015 the company worked with losses due to several reasons, including the permanent lack of working capital caused by the departure of &quot;Unicredit Bank&quot; from the Baltic market, terminating the previously valid credit line, and leaving the &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot; &quot; with concluded contracts without the possibility of fulfilling them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a volume discount.
The relevant bank&#39;s withdrawal from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural fund support projects, which would have allowed the production plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
Also, last year, the company&#39;s financial creators were negatively affected by the increase in the prices of raw materials and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
&quot;Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized the price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - higher - prices&quot;, says the company&#39;s management.
Also, in 2015, &quot;Zilā lagūna&quot; started negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company&#39;s movable and immovable property.
The investors have already been to the company&#39;s largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company&#39;s operation and development were positively affected by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows to achieve higher production productivity and capacity.
&quot;Several equipment was purchased, which ensures a higher production speed&quot;, the company&#39;s management stated.
The management of &quot;Zilā lagūna&quot; notes that the purchased equipment in 2016 will allow the company&#39;s production plant to fulfill orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of products to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the letters of intent have already been signed for the sale of the product, everything produced will be sold according to the letters of intent.
The new product will increase the turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month&quot;, says the company&#39;s management.
Also, in August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq.
In 2016, &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot; sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above-mentioned measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, &quot;Blue Lagoon&quot; worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and a loss of 5.113 million euros.
&quot;Blue Lagoon&quot; was founded in 1997 and its share capital is 1.156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals - Mihailas Kaidanovas (89.11%) and Igors Širšons (10.89%).
Welcome pl. 15 to meet cinema diva Zara Leander at the museum and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the adored cinema diva Zara Leander.
Zāra Leander&#39;s visit to her godmother Ruta, who was the wife of the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924 turned out to be fatal, because it was she who discovered Zāra Leander&#39;s unusual low contralto for a woman, which she tried out during her debut on the Riga cabaret theater stage.
Perhaps it was the random coincidence in Riga that became the fateful turn in Zara&#39;s creative path to world fame.
Riga was associated with warm memories for Zara Leander, and she hoped to come to Riga for guest performances, but unfortunately, these hopes were not destined to come true, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the excellent Ieva Kerevica will play the role of the excellent Zara Leander.
Extensive traffic restrictions have been imposed in the vicinity of Aglona.

Officials say that the demonstration was generally peaceful and that the protesters voluntarily left the building at the request of the employees.
The insurer pays compensation to the passengers of the flight canceled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance has paid a travel insurance compensation to a family for the canceled flight at the &quot;Riga&quot; airport on Wednesday, August 10, due to which they had to give up their planned visit to the music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received a compensation application from a customer.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but as this was not possible due to canceled flights at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was billed for accommodation bookings that could no longer be cancelled, as well as €204 for festival tickets purchased.
On the other hand, the airline has promised to compensate the customers for the money spent on plane tickets.
If Insurance has paid compensation for trip interruption or cancellation in an average of 15% of all travel insurance benefits.
&quot;In such cases, the expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the accommodation reservation, are reimbursed&quot;, says Dagnija Rutka, head of the Personal Risk Insurance product of If Insurance.
As you know, on the evening of August 10, a private plane stopped on the runway of &quot;Riga&quot; airport due to technical problems, so only several departing flights were canceled, but several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
Due to a neighbor&#39;s repairs, the man is faced with a collapsed ceiling and is forced to leave the house.
In LTV&#39;s &quot;4.studija&quot; program, Dmitrij Saidyashevs appealed, whose neighbor started major repairs in his apartment, and since then, Dmitrij&#39;s plaster is crumbling from the ceiling and he is not sure that it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbors did arbitrary construction and the ceiling in my apartment is damaged.
Then I informed the Riga construction board, the building manager and other organizations.
The building authority said that we are not an operative service and we do not have any expert.
&quot;The owner of the apartment has to go to the Union of Engineers of Latvia, and there will be an expert from there,&quot; says Dmitrijs.
The invited expert arrived, recorded the incident and admitted that the cover was in an unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitri&#39;s first application to the building board, and until the beginning of this week, no one was able to answer whether being in the apartment is not life-threatening.
The building authority said - such is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
&quot;Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they forwarded it to the building manager, then the building manager again to the building board, and then there is a dead end&quot;, says Dmitrijs.
After looking through the whole pile of papers, it is clear that the construction works have been stopped, even if you can hear that someone is working there every now and then.
Expertise should be carried out within another two months, and within six months the owner of the apartment, who is carrying out repairs, should eliminate all these defects.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grating in this load-bearing structure has been affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is at risk.
&quot;That&#39;s why we have requested an additional explanation from this expert&quot;, says Ilze Žūka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there you can still hear that the construction is going on.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in the specific case the penalty can be much more severe.
While the expert&#39;s opinion is awaited, the construction board has decided that both apartments may not be operated - both the one where construction works are underway and Dmitri&#39;s apartment.
&quot;This is an unprecedented case in the construction board&#39;s practice, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have created a danger not only to their own property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot operate his property&quot;, says the representative of the building board.
Now Dmitri has to look for another place to live - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or to rent another apartment.
But Dmitriy can try to collect the resulting losses from the neighbor in civil law, which can take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction, staying in both apartments is currently prohibited until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, which may take up to three weeks.
The owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place will have to cover the resulting damages.
The owner of this apartment, due to the fact that he did not take into account what the construction board said, also faces a prison sentence of up to six months.
Guess what!
How many lions in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lion cubs were born in the Demidov Zoo near Kyiv.
Everyone feels good and sometimes hisses at the commoner, despite the fact that the commoner is feeding the babies.
The transformation of the former Ķemeru sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel &quot;Park Hotel Ķemeri&quot; will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, representative of the future hotel manager SIA &quot;Park Hotel Ķemeri&quot;, told LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the renovation of the former sanatorium in Ķemeri.
The second stage will be a &quot;wellness&quot; or well-being clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is currently unknown.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Ķemeru resort polyclinic, the area of which is approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of &quot;Park Hotel Ķemeri&quot; and the intended clinic is the international fund &quot;G Capital Europe&quot;, which invests in European assets.
The owners of &quot;G Capital Europe&quot; are several investors who invest money in this fund, according to Želve.
As the CEO of &quot;G Capital Europe&quot; George Jones said earlier, it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in the creation of the former resort polyclinic, with the total amount of investment exceeding 30 million euros.
It has already been announced that in the restoration of the cultural and historical park with an area of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of access roads and street sections, the construction of an interactive nature tourism object, the improvement of the territory and the construction of parking spaces on Emīla Dārziņa street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jūrmala and the increase in the number of tourists, the Jūrmala City Council plans to attract from 14.5 million euros for European Union funds, co-financed with three to four million euros.
Design works are planned until the middle of 2017, but construction and arrangement works will start in the fall of next year.
As reported, it is planned to build a five-star hotel &quot;Park Hotel Ķemeri&quot; and a &quot;wellness&quot; clinic in the historical sanatorium complex &quot;Ķemeri&quot;.
However, the reconstruction took a long time.
On the other hand, in the 2010 report, it was further stated that &quot;Ominasis&quot; regularly communicates with the hotel operator &quot;Kempinski&quot;, which continues to provide daily technical control at the &quot;Ķemeri&quot; sanatorium&quot;, and already in 2011, &quot;the reconstruction of the future hotel &quot;Ķemeri&quot; will definitely be completed. and preparations for the opening of the &quot;Kempinski&quot; chain hotel will begin immediately.
In October 2014, &quot;Park Hotel Ķemeri&quot; confirmed its readiness to buy the property of the Ķemeri sanatorium belonging to the insolvent &quot;Ominasis Latvia&quot; at an auction, but a month later the auction was declared not to have taken place, because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the specified time.
The sale price was determined according to the starting price of the last auction that did not take place - 2.86 million euros.
As the representative of the city council, Ieva Aile, informed the LETA agency, the municipality, by signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of co-financing from the European Union Structural Funds, it will arrange the adjacent infrastructure - restore the historical Ķemeri Park, create an interactive nature tourism facility, arrange roads and parking lots.
The President will present the Order of Three Stars to the opera singer Antonenko.
Next week, on August 16, the President of the State Raimonds Vējonis will present the third class of the Order of the Three Stars to the opera singer Aleksandars Antonenko, according to the agenda of the President.
The ceremony of awarding the Order of the Three Stars will take place in the House of Blackheads at 1 p.m.
According to the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from Jāzeps Mediņš College of Music in 1998, where he studied wind instruments and learned singing from Margarita Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Department of Jāzeps Vītolas Latvian Academy of Music in the class of Arvīdas Luste.
On the other hand, in 1997 he started singing in the choir of the Latvian National Opera, and in 1998 he made his debut with the role of Oberto in GF Handel&#39;s opera &quot;Alčina&quot;.
He received the &quot;Great Music Award 2003&quot; for his vocal performance in opera performances and Verdi&#39;s Requiem.
It is stated that in the 2004/2005 season he became the most internationally recognized Latvian tenor, who is engaged by the world&#39;s largest opera houses.
Since the fall of 2004, he has been singing at the Düsseldorf Deutsche Oper am Rhein, the Berlin and Graz Operas, the Dresden Semperoper, the Oslo and Stockholm Royal Operas, the London Covent Garden Opera, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, as well as the Geneva, Dresden and Düsseldorf Operas and at the Salzburg Festival.
In 2009, Antonenko made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince in &quot;Mermaid&quot; with great success.
On the other hand, in 2011, Antonenko sang the title role of &quot;Othello&quot; at the Paris Opera with Riccardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, he sang in the new production of Luigi&#39;s &quot;The Settlement&quot; at the Covent Garden Opera, and also participated in the &quot;Girl from the West&quot; staged by Christoph Loy in Stockholm.
A year later, Antonenko sang the role of Othello at London&#39;s Covent Garden Opera with great success.
Former NATO commander Breedlove&#39;s e-mail was hacked by Russian hackers.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out several other cyber attacks, including the e-mail of Philip Breedlove, the former commander of NATO&#39;s European forces, and the servers of the George Soros Institute &quot;Open Society&quot;, the business news agency &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported on Thursday. .
Hackers have published the obtained information on the website &quot;DCLeaks.com&quot;.
Among other things, Breedlove&#39;s correspondence and news about the work of the Soros Institute are posted there.
The institute&#39;s computers were available to hackers for a whole year.
According to &quot;Bloomberg&quot; news, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers connected to Russian special services that hacked the DNC emails.
The newspaper &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reports that the US President Barack Obama&#39;s administration is currently considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of the DNC computers.
To impose sanctions, the administration would have to formally blame Russia or Russian-backed hackers for the cyberattack on Democratic Party servers.
In July, WikiLeaks released about 20,000 emails obtained from the DNC computer system that show Democratic leaders sought to damage the campaign of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton&#39;s former rival. for the start of the presidential election.
According to US press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the hacking of Democratic servers, as well as other US special services, believe that Russia&#39;s connection to the cyber attack is almost beyond doubt.
McCartney: Yoko Ono&#39;s presence threatened The Beatles.
Paul McCartney has admitted that Yoko Ono&#39;s presence created a sense of threat to the legendary group &quot;The Beatles&quot;.
The 74-year-old rock star is currently on &quot;good&quot; terms with the late John Lennon&#39;s widow, but McCartney was intimidated by her when she visited the band in the recording studio, as Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney .
When asked about their relationship, the singer told Rolling Stone: &quot;It&#39;s really good.&quot;
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she sat on the amps.
Most of the group couldn&#39;t stand it.
We managed to do it, but not very successfully because we were very stressed.
We weren&#39;t sexist, but girls usually didn&#39;t come to the recording studio, they let us work.
When John started dating Yoko, she wasn&#39;t sitting in the control room, but in the middle of the four of us.
The author of the blockbuster &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former bandmate Ringo and occasionally confirms the work plans of the recording studio &quot;Apple&quot;, but otherwise &quot;The Beatles&quot; are &quot;done&quot;.
Asked if he was still dating the only other surviving member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone: &quot;Not often.&quot;
We meet at social events and parties.
However, I don&#39;t go to meetings, I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
I sent John Eastman to the meetings instead and said, &quot;Tell me what everybody says, because I can&#39;t stand sitting at that table.&quot;
It was too painful, like seeing your pet die.
The way the company works now is that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA&#39;s latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, which has a hot surface with no water and an atmosphere composed almost entirely of carbon, ever had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously speculated that Venus&#39;s slow rotation rate can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and that it rotated slowly.
The model also looks at the past topography of Venus.
The planet had more dry areas than Earth, but had enough water and geographic diversity to support life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the Sun was 30 percent brighter.
A GISS model simulation of Venus&#39; rotation model reveals that the bright part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, GISS scientist Antony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the planet&#39;s surface and causes rain, which in turn forms layers of thick clouds that act as an umbrella, shielding the planet from the Sun&#39;s heat.
The result is a temperate climate that is actually a few degrees cooler than the temperature on Earth today.
The model represents the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have developed in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation over the course of several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and its vapors were burned by ultraviolet rays.
When the water completely evaporated, all that was left was a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus as we know it today.
The scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy resigned, citing insufficient influence in the team&#39;s decision-making process.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and said the club will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
&quot;For the past three years, I have filled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Club with energy, passion and purpose,&quot; Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I can improve the performance of the team to give it the shine it needs and achieve a higher level of results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of hockey operations must fully align with the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions related to team performance.
Currently, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the &quot;Avalanche&quot; team in 2013-2014. Roy was recognized as the best coach in the league and received the Jack Adams award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs, the Colorado team was defeated by the Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club has not made the playoffs for two years.
&quot;Avalanche&quot; concluded the 2015-2016 season. 2018 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the &quot;Wild&quot; team, failing to receive the second special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and postpone strike
Workers&#39; strikes over the wages of workers on North Sea oil platforms have been postponed, as both sides involved in the dispute have resumed negotiations, according to negotiators.
Strikes are periodically held against the oil processing company &quot;Wood Group&quot; on the North Sea oil platforms where the company &quot;Royal Dutch Shell&quot; operates.
The joint statement states that the Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions have agreed to resume negotiations to resolve the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks, starting early next week, with the aim of revisiting the problematic issues.
The unions said their latest action, organized after a hiatus of more than 25 years, was against a planned 30 percent wage cut.
Due to negative market pressure, &quot;Wood Group&quot; reduced the salaries of employees in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that the additional salary cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has already cut the wages of several thousand people and announced plans to shut down oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work as it prepares for a large-scale merger deal with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain&#39;s decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier in the week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers&#39; representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region&#39;s economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not just individuals.
Almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of the stars in the Pleiades constellation.
The latest mission of the Kepler telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades constellation.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotation speed of the stars is attributed to the formation of planets.
&quot;We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will gain more information about the relationship between the star&#39;s mass, age, and even the history of its solar system,&quot; Luisa Rebula, a scientist at Caltech&#39;s Infrared Process and Analytical Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades constellation is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to grow, reaching an age of about 125 million years.
They spin at maximum speed.
As they rotate at maximum speed, these accreting stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
As the winds enter the star&#39;s magnetic field, they slow down the stars.
As stars age, their rotation speed decreases.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star, determining the time between the appearance of recognizable regions of stars, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of stellar rotation rates shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, taller dancers do pirouettes slower than shorter dancers.
Rebul says that the &quot;ballet&quot; of the Pleiades shows that the slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Because the Pleiades constellation is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory where the characteristics of stars can be compared with their rotation rates.
Rebull says that the Pleiades constellation is helping to build theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down, and about the process of their coming to a complete stop.
Reboul and his colleagues detailed their analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades stars in three new papers to be published soon in the Astronomical Journal.
