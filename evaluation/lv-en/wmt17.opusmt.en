A 28-year-old cook found dead at the San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook was found in the stairwell of a supermarket who recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who wants to hurt his brother, saying: "His life finally began to improve."
The corpse found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday was identified as a 28 - year - old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco office of forensic medicine.
The San Francisco police declared his death to be murdered and are currently investigating.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells the San Francisco station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he got to his dream work at the restaurant "Son & Daughters" in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant "Son & Daughters" informs that the news about his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we will miss him a lot," said the representative.
During this difficult time, we think with Frank's friends and family.
Louis Galicia says that at first Frank had stayed in the hostels, but lately his life had finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the radio station KGO.
Louis Galicia says he doesn't know who would hurt his younger brother.
He was a good person with a wide heart.
"He always pampering his family, preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Thinking of everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that glowed brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctor strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors are asking their trade unions to protest in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Young Doctors Committee (JAC) is about to request advice to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
JAK believes that ministers have failed to dispel their doubts about the Treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
Against the Treaty 58% of all members who took part in the vote voted.
In the message published on Thursday evening on Twitter, Member of JAK Council Ellen McKort points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, as a result of the JAK vote, the offer of the contract has been completely rejected and the decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues'.
In response to the Government's silence, JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the AAL Council to authorise the development of new agreements to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
Following the vote rejecting the contractual conditions proposed by the AAL and recommended by the BMA, Dr Johan Malawana, representative of the AAL's new doctors, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, health secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: An outlawed Alliance?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to rock and announce the end of the war of eight months of names and economic sanctions.
But Vladimir Putin greeted Turkey's leader in St. Petersburg Castle with the impression that this partnership was more needed by Ankara.
Both of them, however, shook their hands.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked artificial and did not give rise to warm emotions, even in view of his usual self - control.
Tajyip Erdogan, on the other hand, at least five times described Putin as his "precious friend," reports an overview of the meeting.
I'm out of number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The following day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm leads to conflicting feelings.
But the radiant coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was to hit a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted harshly.
Putin accused Ankara of piercing a dagger in Moscow's back.
The work was even more painful, considering that it came from a friend's side.
It will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to restore true trust.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
For months, government - controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations that Erdogan's own family made profits from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied that.
But the main message of St. Petersburg's meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from peace reconciliation is obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to overthrow him.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
The same is true of economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have resulted in substantial losses, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually brings millions of Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe in relaxed breaths when regular flights will be renewed.
They hope for a vacation fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the national TV is predicting a fall in fruit and vegetable prices, as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: 'Tourists for them, tomatoes for us'.
But there were other political motives for the visit from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West about, in their opinion, the weak reaction to the coup attempt.
Everything can also be looked at at the frustration of the protracted negotiations on EU accession and Putin's intervention, which is willing to take advantage of the situation of Turkey's alienation from the West.
Russia's leader undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because the fear of changing the regime in the country is deeply rooted in itself.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "outside alliance," two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite the public unity demonstrated, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial discussions, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member Turkey hit a Russian battle plane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The brand SKB will play a supporting role in the future, as announced by the bank's CEO.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, experts in branding strategies have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales all references to SKB, outside the head office and the official stock exchange list, will be changed to NatWest.
The brand The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank, will now also receive attention.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees through Invernesshire.
He told BBC Scotland Channel: "The SKB will become our investor brand and work with our employees, because now we become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with clients under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring "Sesu Nations" and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we had announced that we would become an excellent bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focussing on the needs of our customers rather than our own, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the time.
Frankie Detori wins the 3,000th victory by winning first place in Newmarket with horse Predilation
Dectors unblock the champagne by winning their 3,000. win twice finishing the first race in New Market.
On Friday, Jackie Frankie Detore won his 3,000th victory in British history, gaining first place in New Market.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in these races, which took place in his home town, riding with Predilation, which John Gosden traines.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jokey who has achieved such a result in horse sprint races.
He's joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edery and Willy Carson.
The three-time champion Jokey Detors, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New Market because I have been here for 30 years.
This isn't a big race, this isn't a Royal Ascots, it's a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detors and Predelection are welcomed with applause and covetousness.
Two jockeys have reached this record in the race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the last 20-time champion, Sir Antony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4300 victories.
Lester Pigot, a nine-time derby winner, won 4493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of today, and it is no surprise that he has made a success of what few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma years attract fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom's race that he would have won 6,000 victories if he didn't participate only in weekends and big races.
However, seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race on a regular basis for 30 years.
He's a lively man who works great at the British race, and he's a great Jokey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his brand name - the flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detoi has been the face of British horse races for twenty years.
This has been an adventurous journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Ascott, and has survived aircraft crashes and disqualifications on the use of preparations.
Three years ago it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character strength, challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for some more time - Dectors have said earlier that they would like to continue participating in the race until at least 50 years of age.
President Putin releases Head of Administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released the head of the administration Sergei Ivanovo.
Ivanov has been among Putin's closest people for many years.
Today, 63-year-old politician has been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his post as Head of the Russian President's Administration" without mentioning the reason.
POB: Ivanov, Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy to him since 2012.
44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State International Relations Institute (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to Kremlin's website (in Russian), he later led the President's protocol and the government staff administration.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the country by drafting laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his alternate.
Is the smile convincing?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet security service in the KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the national television broadcast meeting, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite camera-focused smiles, rarely does such an explanation convince you, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of the power struggle?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that a man, who was considered to be a potential president, suddenly wanted to become a leader of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great scepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanovs says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to entrust me with this difficult post, which could even be said to be problematic, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this post for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990's, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the KGB, Ivanov held the post of deputy to him.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusts most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanovs was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, because Putin's re-election for the third term would be unconstitutional.
But at that time, another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to presidential office three and a half years later.
The appearance of mysterious fish in a garden in the town of Banfa
A man in Banfa asks for help to find out what kind of fish appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 fish could be sand eels that have come back with the water room.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 50 feet [500 m] from the sea, published a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimeters of fish came into his garden.
The intersection of the Queensphere: the bridge is now connected to the Fiff.
A project worth GBP 1,35 billion is currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensphere intersection with the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts is finished, which means that the bridge is nearing its completion.
The faifa bridge is built 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The project currently worth GBP 1.35 billion is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Kate Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historical moment in the construction of the Queensphere Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only this part is built using more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the final section that will connect the bridge to Rosite will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to be laid.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the construction of top-class civil engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road to a part of the land, or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viaduct at the northern access point to the south of 700 millimetres.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Huge because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be pulled in an oblique angle of about 36%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimeters.
Happily, everything worked well.
Simon Billes acquires gold in exercise for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
It doesn't bother Simon Bill.
Dynamic jumps.
Perform exercises on the log effortlessly.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Perfectly perfect.
And finally, the Olympic Champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was superior to the result of the silver medal winner and her team member Aly Raismane and the result of the bronze medal winner of Russian athlete Alya Mustafina.
On Thursday, the U.S. athlete Simon Bails carried out the exercises on the logs in the individual multi-fight finals for women at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Baisa became the fourth American in a row who won the title of the multi-fight champion and the fifth best gymnast, gradually strengthening her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and probably the best gymnastics in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey was over.
This achievement puts him next to such unparalleled athletes as Michael Phelp, who raised his sport to a different level.
For the last three years, Bailes has dominated her sport by winning 15 medals at world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such brilliant, precise and ambitious combinations of exercises that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lu Retone called him "the best gymnastics she has ever seen."
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the hopes placed on her, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed to return to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
The American athletes Simon Bill (left) and Alija Raismane fight after winning the gold and silver medal respectively in the individual multi-fight sports finals for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bills on Tuesday, making a special team coordinator Marta Karoli's farewell party.
Although Billus claims that she did not expect anything like that on her long journey to the peaks of fame, it is not true.
Some of her performances, which include her special acrobatic passage, are accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the arena of the Rio Olympic Games.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and was discovered by the coach Amy Boorman's mother on a tour to the gym where Boorman's tanks took place has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in multi-fight competitions since summer 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bailes wants to.
Although Mustafin's two rotations took some lead, it was only an illusion.
The balance beam and free movement - part of the competition, where Bailes will defend her title, are still ahead.
She took the lead with a score of 15.433 on the log and strengthened the control with a result of 15.933 free movements
Raismane gently hugged her while waiting for the results, which was only a formality and she broke out in tears of joy, when the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook came true.
The result of Raismane was a slight revenge for four-year-old events, when she shared her third place with Mustafin, but she lost her battle for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call "grandmother," took a convincing lead.
After her performance in her free movement, which allayed her doubts about her return, she was able to dedicate her air kisses to the crowd.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bill's viral Twitter recording r, which she published this week, has a completely different meaning.
The 6-year-old Mahaj Braun "boo-holed" survives shooting at Philadelphia.
The police say that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that it is already the second six-year-old who shot in Philadelphia this week.
The children's grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Deloresa Melendez, tells the television: "His little body was simply pierced by bullets."
I can't believe it.
The boy has been placed in a hospital in critical condition and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family tells us that he is going to recover.
He had to start first grade in the local primary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical condition, while the other two victims are in a stable condition.
The channel says that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29 - year - old victim in a critical condition.
The other two were not in the car, and the police investigate whether any of them was an attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were most likely involved in the shooting.
Instead of the event, they found the patrons of the gun that belong to a variety of weapons.
It looks like it's been a long shot.
On both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk there were found liners.
"So it looks as if there were several armed shooters here who actively participated in the shooting," says Antony Ginaldi, Captain of the Philadelphia Police.
Several homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has been detained yet and the police are reported to check the recordings of surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday, a stray bullet hit a 6 - year - old girl in her hand while she was playing in front of her house in the Vestouklein district.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for someone to blame.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby, and Laurie?
I call it the annual Women's Olympic Athleat Team for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team consists of three athletes, Simon Bill, Gaby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is a Jewish and Madison Cocian, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team is truly representing America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast is an African-born American.
Last year Simon and Gabby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympic Games, Gaby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen unbelievable exercises performed by the three world champions Simon Bill, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row who has won the gold medal for women in their individual multifight.
Alija Raismane, a member of her team, won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but in the rest of the country, the situation during exercise is completely different.
Simon, Gabby, and Laurie joined the Olympics, as did Allie and Madison.
They are "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic gymnasium team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Marta Karola's work.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnastics are mainly trained in private athletics clubs and are supported by parents who pay for trainings, rooms, travels, uniforms, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
Athletes in these clubs spend all their workouts, and this is an expensive and long investment for the athletes' families.
Amy Boorman - a coach of Simon Bill and Maggie Hayney - a trainer of Laurie Hernandez has trained her athletes since both girls started doing athletics.
We need to provide young girls who inspire Simona, Gabby and Laurie with cheaper exercise opportunities.
I founded my own athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish) exercise sessions free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September we will open a branch in Detroit (in my home town) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and focus.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
Working with this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simona, Allie, Gaby and Madison for the great demonstration of the "Girls Force," receiving the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer has been rejected, the new doctors are planning to increase the number of strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, pointing out that NHS is in a precarious situation and that further delays will only be detrimental to workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr. Ellen Makourta, spokesperson for BMA's young doctors, stated that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for a level playing field for all doctors.
The remaining eight weeks until the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so progress is needed, because there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiation have been confronted with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with total silence.
This has happened despite the fact that, just last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop inaction, and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not, new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to picket.
Ministers hoped to put an end to their differences by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate by working on weekends for 54 000 young doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
Daniel Mortimer, Executive Director of NHS Employment, urged young doctors not to strike.
Mr Mortier explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the workers under pressure and are worrying, causing stress and delays for patients, carers and their families.
We have been talking to the new medical committee for the last two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of workers, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, quitting studies and gender pay inequality in medicine, shows that employers, England's health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are seriously willing to implement the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicines for 2 pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack may be expected to be treated with 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend that more people use it and for a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart diseases.
This medicine is already prescribed for 12 months after heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack.
It is recommended to use NHS at 4 years after heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the current use of NHS-managed NICE is recommended for 4 years after heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Each year, about 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack, and a quarter of them experience a heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by a build-up of fat in the walls of the heart, causing blockages.
If the blockage breaks, it can cause a blood clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if a blood clot separates from the wall of the blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood's access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of recurrent heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by AstraZeneca, UK and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots forming.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and for another 3 years 60 mg twice a day with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of NICE Health Technologies, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attack and heart attack in people who have experienced it.
Preliminaryly recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are glad that we can extend treatment options to thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use beyond this time limit.
A culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to a management report, former Mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from his post in connection with corruption.
The Government's report reveals that a culture of political correctness turns a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government Sir Erik Pickle criticises the police, electoral supervisors and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the electoral process because "he is afraid to offend ethnic and religious interests."
A former community secretary, who has now become the head of an anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to place guards at electoral stations to protect intimidating voters.
He also suggested that voters should present a personal identification document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Currently, only the name and address of the voter must be provided.
He even suggested that the fingers of the voters who voted should be identified with a special ink in order to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs must also be given greater protection, says Sir Erik.
He believed that the press should give greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud, which goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Daunnings Street after the scandal in connection with the town elections in Taurhamlet.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to cancel the mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, from the town mayor's office due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "criminated" his Muslim community's religious view and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the stance that the Muslim religious duty of believers is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that postal fraud was particularly worrying, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for the candidates they wanted.
Sir Erik recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a personal identification document, in order to establish a personal identity.
His report states: 'The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, are being forced to vote for the senior candidates selected by the community, particularly in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan'.
"There is a concern that district authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, because of the potential to offend ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Erik set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to act with the votes cast by post to prevent the "collection of votes."
The report by Teresa May also calls for a more thorough check of the registration in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider asking voters to present an identity document before voting.
Mark the fingers of the voters who voted with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematic verification of the nationality of persons to ensure that a person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes cast by post and electoral envelopes for postal voting.
To provide the police with the power to assign security to the polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibit photographing at the polling stations.
The requirement to use English only in the polling stations (except in Wales).
Step up training to ensure that district workers go to the ballot box one by one.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the Metropolitan police, expressing a lack of understanding that no charges have been made in the Taurerhamlet case.
He says: "The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for corruption and fraud-related activities."
He was strongly found guilty of criminal law evidence on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He is also critical of the inefficient city council electorate's "folk check" at the polling stations.
Sir Eric says: "The last year's court decision is an alarm call.
Our land is known as the homeland of Parliament, but the alarming and hidden electoral fraud and the pretending of institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
An exciting ride with a cyclist - Kate's companion and other counterparts of Rio's Olympic celebrities
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games are excited about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, whom the fans have recognized to be extremely similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
However, a 24 - year - old cyclist is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who, according to the media, is proud of her celebrities.
Therefore, in honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are now visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics participants that is quite similar to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. archer team member Brady Allison, on the left, since childhood is compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio
Apart from Kate's companion on the cycling track, many people on the Internet say that this archer could be the brother of the superstar Leonardo Di Kaprio twins.
Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. male archer team, caused a storm on Twitter when photographs were published, where he was very similar to Wall Street Wilck.
The athlete himself noticed a storm in social media and admitted that he was compared with Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see a big similarity, except for the beard," Brady says to Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I see it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular twins of the 2012 London Olympic Games will undoubtedly gain even greater popularity: the striking similarities between the British far-reaching Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neal Patrick Harris.
Thanks to her large, expressive eyes, Russian athletics Alija Mustafin is compared with the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
Speaking of swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has been compared for several years with Matthew Morrison's "Created Stage" star.
Change: this user noticed that Nathan is a sporty version of the film "Inception" actor.
Ancient twins are the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartney, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Jūlija Efimova and actress Annalina Makcorda can be proud not only of sun-burned skin and blonde hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that athletic American athlete Nathan Adrian is like Joseph Gordon Levit.
Bad women: The football star (left) Houpa Solo and the Deksters series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes.
There is no one: a Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: this user believes that there may be a reason why both look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user was delighted to say that "the rest of Internet users agreed that Houta Solo and Jennifer Karpentere actually look identical."
The U.S. football star and the Deksters series really have very similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons refer to Carey Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the actress Laura Linney's smile. Likewise, Gaby Douglas, the winner of the gold medal, is proud of a beautiful, wide smile similar to the "Bring It On" star Gabriel Uniyon's smile.
The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer was 'ending like a pig'.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha finish in the fourth place of the 4x200 m free-style relay for women, caused the indignation of CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize, as one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "flyed out of the race that he was laughing alone" and "will end as a pig."
Commentator Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was switched off when 4x200 m free-style relays for women at the end of the final presented their personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the team of CBC commentators to give the comments vitality, said, "Its little 14-year-old Chinese cannot keep up."
"Too instigated, she flew out of the race, that she just laughed and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second stage was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of Canadian Taylor Rucka, allowing Canadians to achieve China.
The audiences across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emmet McFharlain wrote on Twitter: "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "destined like a pig"???"
Idiot didn't understand that they were still in direct air.
Ai Yanha from China's 4x200m free-style final was named a "small 14-year-old from China who does not keep up."
Criticism against Byron McDonald quickly became effective because many requested clarification.
Twitter users could not believe in hearing the insensitive comments of Byron McDonald.
On Twitter, the user Sara Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and for you, we all sound like racists. #Righty.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who was the head of the CBC live at the time, apologised for McDonald's comments, saying, "We apologise for commenting on the swimming result in direct air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that this happened.
The CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
Then the CBC copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that the following comments have been made and have been made in direct air.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologized to all live streamers and followers in the social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were made about the swimmer's performance and not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, these were unprofessional and unsuccessful selected statements, and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized in direct air and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be treated as a personal attack.
In the live CBC Olympics, he said: "I would like to use a moment and apologise for a comment I made yesterday after women's free-style competitions."
I am talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I didn't mean to show disrespect, and I'm really sorry that it happened.
Primark's buyers are shocked by a woman who is shamelessly trying underwear in the middle of a store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress up to try her panties in the middle of the store.
By further aggravating the situation, she tried them to make sure they fit for her and then took off by putting the panties back on the shelf of the store.
She continued looking for clothes at the Folkeston Bouverie Place shopping centre store and tried four more panties.
Primark shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston, a place where this woman tried her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At that time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, was in the store, telling us that the unfamiliar woman, after trying her underwear, put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She says that people could not believe their eyes.
While standing in the middle of the store, she took her underwear from the shelf, took off her tights and trousers, and measured them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she simply tried them right there.
Everyone watched her take off the panties and evidently didn't like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She took three more panties until she decided that she didn't like any of them and left the store.
He didn't seem to be worried that someone was watching or thinking about someone who would buy the clothes she was trying to do.
Ms. Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says, "The idea is that someone will buy clothes that are customized by another person and that haven't been washed out afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson adds: "I assume that after her departure, the store's employees took these clothes out of the store's shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman has tried it and hasn't washed it.
Primark's representative indicated that Primark was known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes have been removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in a close distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Mag's grand master from New York Ron Mizrake.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and win over the attacker.
The excavators point out that when an attacker attacks from the back, it is necessary to turn first to see the attacker clearly and to avoid the trajectory of the attacker.
Then the gun must be caught between its front arm and shoulder and be beaten in the face of the enemy with his free elbow.
Then comes the blow with the knee down the circus, and while the attacker freezes in pain, he has to take his gun away, hit his face with the jaw of the gun and step aside, continuing to turn the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches the front, the situation is similar - it is necessary to avoid the trail of the shot, to grasp the weapon, and to put it in such a way that the evildoer cannot be fired.
At the same time, pressure on the weapon must be applied and the enemy must be beaten by his breasts and finally take his weapon away and step back by continuing to target him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Misraki does that.
But remember, if you're not a master of Krav Mag, it's safer to give the robber your money.
The Vandal family demolishes Saltash Cornwall's social home and is placed on the street.
The Vandal family has been put out of the place for terrorising neighbors, causing damage to the social house of 50,000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner, Shane Trebilkok, are merely made of property in Saltash Cornwall because of several complaints against them.
When they were forced out of the property, the shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, garbage was thrown out everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now out of property and most likely lives in a private property.
Donna Makevoy, manager of Cornwall Housing Service, says that there is a concern that housing cannot be restored.
She tells us that the people who lived here were extremely difficult, and she believes that people cannot live like this.
A number of factors need to be considered in the present case, since in future this property will not be of good repute in Cornwall.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were regularly owned, and the police say that their terror was manifested as violence, street treatment with baseball bats, intimidation of the local population, drug abuse, drug sales, and loud trembling and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, in whose name he was owned, was sentenced in June to punishment for antisocial behaviour.
Several rooms in a demolished house have found litter.
In a house where drugs can be traded in the past, several floor boards have also been pulled out.
Neighbors say that they regularly climbed the street and are constantly called the police.
They were forced out of the property by Cornwall Housing Service when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about eviction, for their life was an absolute hell.
One said, "They were not cared for by other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrik, Head of Neighbourhood Protection of Cornwall Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has been here for 20 years and the police are regularly called here.
In the overgrown garden of the house, various old and unusable objects were found.
He also said, "It is a pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because eviction from the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and neighbors were supposed to have had a very difficult look at their behavior.
I appreciate the work my whole team has done on this, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the commune who were brave and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and will show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrik said that all three sons here were living in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after displaying.
The staff will now have to clean the rubbish pile left in the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of storing Class B drugs with a view to their distribution.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Scheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being extorted, they became aware that they are now renting a private property in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on many walls of the house.
The police say that they will continue to evict tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Angela Krova, spokesperson for Devona and Cornwall police, points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe they can behave like they want and will have no consequences."
The Devon and Kronvol police do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The readiness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

The mayor of Cannes has banned the burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of Cannes, France's southern resort town, has banned wearing burkini swimsuits on the beaches of this city, almost completely covering the body of a woman and very resembling hydrosuit, announced on Thursday by local officials.
The mayor of Cannes David Linārs has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swim suit that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmales' dress, which exemplifies religious affiliation at a time when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk of disruption to public order (rushing, clashes, etc.), which must be prevented," says the order.
"We are not talking about a ban on the use of religious symbols on the beach, but about external clothing related to trust in the terrorist movements waged with us," explained Thierry Migul, manager of municipal utilities.
He added that the burkini swimsuits on the Cannes beaches have not been seen since July 28, when Linārs, a member of the centre party Republicans, signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the Aquapark in Marseille abolished a planned private event for Muslim women who would have dressed in burkini swimsuits, as both right-wing and left-wing politicians expressed their indignation at this event.
In France, it is prohibited to wear face-covering Islamic women's headgear, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby resort town of Cannes, Nice, for which ISIS was responsible.
On 26 July, two attackers who had swore their loyalty to the Islamic State brutally murdered priests in the church in the north-west of France.

The household goods retailer SIA "Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" ("Jysk") last year showed its turnover by 5%, reaching EUR 23.66 million, according to "Firmas.lv."

The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, Slokas Street, and closed the store in Riga, Kurzemes prospekts.
This year, like other years, the main task of the company is to further increase both turnover and profit.
Meanwhile, profits made last year are recommended to be left undistributed.
"Jysk" is an international network of shops offering goods for home improvement.
SIA "Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" was founded in 2001.
The company's share capital is 3 500 264 euros.

The festival "Kubāna" has started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, the evening in Lucavsala was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - until Sunday night there will take place "Kubāna."
In the first evening, such groups as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which were expected last year but disappeared from the program, American punks "NOFX," DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
In the coming days of the festival, too, there are noteworthy words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage," the drummer of the legend "Ramone" Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg," "Brutto&Lyapis" with the leader of the Belarusian punk in front of Sergei Mikhalok, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, the Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it didn't stop the organizers from a repeated attempt - they added a spirit to the name, included a group of Latvians in the program (Friday's evening 19:15 on stage climb "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and acquired local colorite alongside the symbols of Riga such as its panorama and cats."
Whether these efforts will be successful, it is too early to judge, because the festival only ran, but, as "Delfi Entertainment" observed on the first evening, at least for the time being huge crowds have not been attracted and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
Britain's Trek cycling team twice right the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
The British track team twice corrected the Olympic record on Thursday and won the sprint races for men.
The first record of the Olympics was corrected by the British in the qualification, but in the first round of the competition it was re-corrected by the New Zealanders.
The Sprint Final met the British team with New Zealand, and the British took away the title of New Zealanders' Olympic record holders, leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won with a score of 42.440 seconds, exceeding the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected for the qualification of the women's driving trip - the British team was correcting the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but the shadows of the first President of Latvia, Jānis Čakste, and the last President of the pre-war period, Kārlis Ulmanis, have remained undeserved.
None of our statesmen have defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, wrote Arnolds Auziņš in his book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgals ten years ago.
In his conversation with the portal "Delfi," Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-ranking politicians who had a sense of humor.
The rest of them stiff, always very right.
He couldn't have been, today it could be similar to what Raimonds Vējonis is.
"He was close to the people," says Auziņš.
Contemporary politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Karl Ulmani as the good leader, but rarely do they know how bad he was.
In government sittings, the only person to whom he has not shouted was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind and smiling in pictures, he was by nature hysterical.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democracy, has the exact opposite impression," says Auziņš.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in conversation with "Delfi" agrees with Auziņa's assessment of Zemgals as a peaceful and balanced stateman.
He also notes that Zemgals has shown respect for minorities and regularly invited Jewish representatives to the Presidential Palace.
"At that time, it was not a customary practice, after the Zemgals Presidency, Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," says historian.
He was such a quiet and balanced man who had long been persuaded to become president.
He didn't seek it himself, he simply didn't crave fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know French, but he believed that the President should be able to do so.
"During the Presidency, the basics of the French language were learned," explains Stranga.
Zemgal did not allow himself to be re-informed to stand as a candidate; he did not like it at all.
In all respects, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, already before he was in a serious position in the Presidential Palace - he was a very sought after notary notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgala kisi Suvorova iela 3, where there was a society of savers and lenders, in which the Latvian state was practically formed in government negotiations.
He was always progressive.
He wasn't a big fan of Ulmanis, but he wasn't publicly opposed either.
"In private conversations, however, it has sometimes been said that the actions of Ulmanis do not please him," Stranga points out.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How does Semigala remember today?
It's a pity, but for a large part he's only associating with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, he was central.
"There were no major shocks in his time, i.e. he could associate with such a really stable presidency," summed up Stranga.
During the Gustave Zemgala Presidency, from 1927 to 1930, the Latvian state visit to Sweden took place, which at that time indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the Northern European family of democratic nations.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals visited Stockholm.
The reply of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871 and passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often come across the fact that the anger of a child, the appearance of rage, is viewed by parents as something wrong and insane.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Jekaterina Kess.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - the anger and anger that everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we adults are angry, upset - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep within ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can be angry to kick a couch, smoke a cigarette (that is not the best way to dissipate anger!), go into a shower, sneak up the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We do not take our aggression against others because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are angry, do not understand what happens to them, how to call them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!" You're a fool," "bad mom," "I don't see you," "I'm not gonna grow up with you" - and very rarely can you say, "I'm angry with you."
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely here, at this point, they are spontaneous and truly in showing their feelings, and they are often also trapped in various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent a child from expressing feelings, including anger, from shame and from complaining, but, on the contrary, from helping the child.
Do you need a break in the relationship?
A long working day in which everything hasn't quite happened as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to "depart" from the world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to pause the relationship and breathe a little bit for a while?
Or does it show that each of the partners has its own way to go?
They share their views with gentlemen in different ages.
Jānis (23) is brief and concise: "In my view, if you need a break in your relationship, you are not with the right person."
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then it's definitely the right time to look into other hunting fields to see if you miss him or if you don't especially think about him or even want to see him again.
So the answer is, yes, taking a toy can help you save time and understand the importance of the other half.
Cameron (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, a meal should be taken from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People get tired of each other, especially if there's no more to talk about, just about what you've done day by day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven't endured the relationship for more than a few months either.
If you think at some point that something else or another is better, why does this woman, with whom you are with, deserve to think that it is not good enough and that there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is already a little betrayal.
If not, it is not.
"I have, so I a little condemn those who don't." said Edmund (46).
Carl (33) has almost the opposite view.
I think everyone needs a moment of rest.
You can't watch each other in your eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice in the endless love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its own time.
Of course, even for a girlfriend or wife, however, if both can hold their balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live up to the edge of the grave.
That's what it's like.
Mārtiņš (27) said: "It is hard to say - it is necessary or not to, may or may not take it, but one thing is clear - the initiator has nothing to do with his relationship, something is missing."
If this question is raised, it is up to you to take into account that there will be some change in the near future - to the right or to the wrong.
I mean, while you're still young and crazy, you need a break - even all the time, but when everything gets serious and the relationship gets into a completely different phase, then there's nothing to talk about rest.
You decide to spend your entire life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society right now and sometimes need a respite, then what will happen when you're retired, who comment, as passing cats do or argue about the day on which the garden is better to be destroyed," explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozentāls first aroused interest in fine arts among the Latvian people.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian nation, which as such will remain unforgettable," Romans Suta wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when opening the grand master's extensive retrospective exhibition in the renovated main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on August 12, but already from August 13 it is open for visitors and will be open until October 30.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours the painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916) with a wide retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall, whose 100th birthday on the international scale is included in the calendar of UNESCO's festive days.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozentāls' anniversary programme.
The selection of works of art is largely based on the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic's creative activities, stylistic variations and the variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, Literature and Music Museum, Liepaja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the centuries is revived by the presence of photos, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals a separate work of art in conjunction with photographs taken by the painter and his own camera for creative purposes.
The Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozentāls-Seura," named after a Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art at the same time offers the first stop of a small informative travelling exhibition "With a look in Finland, with a heart in Latvia."
A similar exhibition with content presentation in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the autumn at the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki.
Matt Leblank looks forward to returning to the TopGear show.
Met Leblank, head of the TV broadcast "TopGear" ("Gaze in the floor!""), said that he was eagerly waiting for his return to the second season of the car show, but admitted that he didn't know what's waiting for him in the future.
So far, nothing is officially happening.
"If there is, then it will be announced to the BBC," in conversation with the television critics revealed Leblank.
Doubts about the future of "Gas in the floor!" arose in July when Leblank's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblank and "Gas in the floor!" were "as created for each other."
Evans describes the star of the former series "Friends" ("Friends") as "a true and good man," thus dispelting the rumors that both friendships have failed during filming.
When Leblankm asked what he liked most on the show, he replied that travelling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC tells us that the show in the new 24th season does not yet plan to replace Evans.
Kalviņš: Meldonia could be removed from the list of prohibited substances already this year.
It is expected that already this year the meldonia in the composition of the Latvian medicinal product Mildronate could be removed from the list of prohibited substances for athletes, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, Ivars Kalviņš, said at the LNT broadcast on Friday morning for 900 seconds.
He explained that he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the issue of meldonia with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed the hope that Mildronate would be removed from the "black list" already this year.

Meanwhile, in the Dobele district, in Naudīte municipality, a motorcyclist born in 1989 tried to avoid a dog running on the road and overturned.
He's in the hospital, too.
Last day in Latvia, 71 road accidents involving 16 people were registered.
In some places it's raining and it's getting cooler.
Also on Friday in Latvia there will be some temporary rains and become another cooler degree, the agency LETA learned at the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
There is room for briquettes.
According to forecasts, rain is expected mostly in Kurzeme and in the north of Vidzeme.

In Riga, the day will pass without precipitation and mostly the sun will shine.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The backstage of the U.S. model business in his interpretation has gained a perverse glance of sophisticated photo shoots and the intolerable nature of horror movies.
Basically, it is a very provocative work, balancing sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which it is hard to draw the line between European art house films and Hollywood's genre product territory.
The film with Vigo Mortensen highlights the question of whether the conceptually chosen models of life of parents (ecologicality, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from the smoothness and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveism to their children.
The father of six children, the idealist after his wife's death, is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and the real values.
A touching, life-guide film by Matt Ross this year won the Cannes Festival award for the directorship.
Of course, sharks just do it like they attack the beautiful girls - in the Jokes it was a swimmer, in this case, a brave surfer, represented by Blake Laivley.
Her work has required her to be a valiant man.
This survival solonum can be compared to James Franko's activity show in the film for 127 hours and Ryan Reynolds' game in the film buried alive.
Perhaps it is also to blame for the main role played by Mila Kunisa, whose transformations from the model memory to a creative citizen and a ridiculer of almost family values seem only to be created by the fantasy of desperate Hollywood scriptwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The Islamic state fighters of the terrorist group, fleeing from Menbiza, Syria in Aleppo province, have captured around 2,000 civilian populations used as living shields, announced on Friday the Kurdish and Arab alliance supported by the US and observers.
"We didn't shoot at them because they took civilians with them while fleeing to Gerabulus" announced a press representative of the Kurds Menbiza Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), the US-supported Kurdish-Arab Alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiza had been released from Jihadists.
The Islamic State of Menbiza was captured in 2014.
The QSD expelled most of the ISIS fighters from Menbiza last week, but some maintained and showed fierce resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking captives with them.
The Islamics are heading to Gerabulus, on the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based Syrian activist organisation, also reported that some 2,000 people were kidnapped by the ISIS.
SOHR reported that Islamists kidnapped the city's citizens' cars, forced the people to get into them, and then took them to Gerabulus.
Former member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
In January, Islamists kidnapped over 400 civilian populations, including women and children, in the Deir az Zora province in eastern Syria.
Later, Islamics released some 270 of their prisoners.
The number of Islamic State fighters fleeing Menbiza is unknown.
A press representative of the Kurdish Menbiza Military Council reported that QSD succeeded in rescuing 2,500 people held in captivity by Islamists in Menbiza.
According to information collected by SOHR, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, were killed in the fight for Menbiza.

Kolegova refuses to stand for the position of Head of the State Revenue Service.
Inga Kolegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the agency was informed by LETA in the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has contributed to the contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible, but more often, invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
"It is also not acceptable to me," emphasizes has already been a candidate for the position of Head of the State Revenue Service.
In case her candidacy would be approved by the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow to fully work and implement the necessary changes to the SRS, feeling the support of the whole government.
Without it, full work would not be possible, concludes Kolegova.
"For a number of times, I've publicly stressed that I don't want to be politically dependent, but now the whole process of my candidacy is too politicised," explains the official.
"Thanks for the trust and support shown to me, it is an experience that I appreciate as a benefit," writes Kolegova in the application to Reizniece-Ozola.
Unity on Wednesday, the meeting with Kolegov revealed "substantial contradictions" between the applicant's explanations and the information available in the public registers about dividends paid by SIA Pallogs, as publicly available decisions of the Pallogs members' meetings provide for profit not to be retained.
Currently, Deputy Director General of the State Revenue Service is in charge of managing the State Revenue Service in Dace Peleka.
The police in Livani are involved in the rescue of two small unsupervised children, informs the State Police Latgale Region Administration.
The message about unattended trolleys with babies received on Friday around 7:00 pm.
They were in Livani near the former store building.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the medical staff for help.

In less than half an hour, the child's parents were legally aware of the possible location of their parents and went there.
Upon arrival at the home of the female civil officer, the police found out that the woman was sleeping because of the strong influence of alcohol.
According to the original information, in the evening of the previous day, a woman born in 1992 visited a girlfriend who used alcohol.
As she goes home after a meal, she decided to leave her children to the store under unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphan's court, who will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the SAO regarding the Russian Island project.
Riga Freeport Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (SAO) regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development on Krievu Island for port activities transfer from the city centre, Diena.lv portal informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned in the nearest meeting of the board of the Freeport of Riga.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the opinion of the SAO, when preparing the necessary documentation for implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte at the Riga Freeport Authority and the recommendations given to improve project management in the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the SAO on the efficiency of implementation of the Russian Island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and for the provider of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the works planned for the project have been fully completed within the time limits and the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the SAO and also to the stevedors that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the SAO regarding the project management and monitoring issues," says Sanita Kaire, the project manager of the Russian Islands.
For the control and monitoring of the project's objective, the existing long-term operational plan was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the parties involved and the necessary decision deadlines, the definition of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the monitoring tools of the planned construction process, as well as the definition of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for achieving the project goal by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, has been supplemented with implementation monitoring activities, thus strengthening the time limit control of activities of other parties involved in the project implementation from the Riga Freeport side.
A new project management plan has been developed for the improvement of project management and reduction of potential risks, defining the project management areas and specifying the documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
In order to increase the capacity of the project, a project management body chart has been developed that reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the employees.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed for the project, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders, principles, types and periodicity of the information exchange for the successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve control over the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the launch of a procurement and the rule of law will need to be further justified in the future.
Within the framework of the project, Krievu Island has built a port infrastructure that meets world standards - four new deep sea berths, railway connections, as well as engineering communications.
Constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of last year, achieving savings of € 10.6 million in funding.
Difficulties have led to increased security at airports in Slovakia.
Following receipt of non-specific threats, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, announced by the Ministry of the Interior.
"In view of the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," a press representative from the Slovak Ministry of Interior announced the news to AFP on Friday.
"The National Safety and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
On 16 September, the Slovak capital will host an informal European Union (EU) summit with all the countries of the bloc, except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia holds the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths under the Communist yoke of the former East German border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims have still not been dispelled.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, on the border with the western allies and the later West Germany, the Communist authorities murdered 1,841 people trying to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and periodically adjusting the number of victims.
This year, another 11 deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims a six-year-old boy who drowned in trying to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
The new victims of the Berlin Wall also include the Soviet army deserters.
"The total amount of harm caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," says the museum director Aleksandrs Hildebrante.
"Our task is to make sure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape from a Communist-controlled country are maintained and not lost," stressed the Hildebrant's statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is inconclusive," says Jochen Schtate, an expert in the history of East Germany at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, along with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have only managed to confirm 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that only the Communists at the Berlin Wall had murdered 138 people.
Taking into account those who died, trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or to get to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, Stutta believes that the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the difference in the number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not linked to direct violence.
"If seniors between 70 and 80 years of age died from a heart attack after the contraction of border control," Hildebrante believes.
However, Stutat is convinced that a distinction should be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of the treatment they experienced, and those whose death was caused by a long waiting period during the hot weather on the bus at the border.
Regardless of this, the record of victims is not easy because the Communist authorities in East Germany did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to study documents in various scattered archives, states Statate.
However, the States Group has recently produced new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
The President of LPF, Ponte, went to Rio with the coach's accreditation; it is a surprise.
In recent days, Kaspars Pone in Rio de Janeiro, the President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), has come to the Olympic Games with the accreditation of the coach, but he feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, an extensive agiotage arose after the statements of the Olympic swimmer Aļona Ribakova coach Germans Jakubovskis, who discovered that at the last minute in Rio de Janeiro decided to go to Pone, while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially, swimmers Aļona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the president of the Federation Pone, were approved on the list of drivers.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for the Olympic Games, and even before his departure Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans would be looking for tickets.
"Nevertheless, apparently for objective reasons, he didn't," said Pone, expressing the view that it didn't affect the results of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvy's coach undertook to help her.
Pone, who himself is a member of the LOC Executive Committee, strongly criticised the activities of the LOC, putting the blame on the Olympic sports supervisory organisation.
In my view, it is unethical for the LOK Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to take one of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough seats," Pone said that the work of the Federation and its presidents wasn't appreciated in society, reminding them that the presidents of the Federations didn't get their salaries.
Pone also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sport Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone couldn't tell us why he was with a coach's accreditation at the Olympic Games, which was probably due to Jakubovskis.
"I was applied as the President of the Federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I got the coach's accreditation and I'm not getting anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I thought German would be, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information at the disposal of LETA agency, a couple of days before the start of Ribakov, she had a conversation with Poni and a swimmer with tears in her eyes, however, the President of the LPF himself said that it was an everyday conversation with the desire to prepare the athletes before the start.
Pone reminded that LPF oversees five sports in the Olympic programme, and four of them also provide training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that issues of drowning are also very important in Latvia, and he also talked about such programmes when he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup stage could take place in Latvia.
Location in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, I spend my time and I try to implement four-year programmes.
There will be 600,000 salmon juveniles in the Daugava.
During the Latvenergo fish resource recovery program, salmon and sea trout are being introduced in Daugava near Mangalsala this week, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600 000 annual salmon and sea trout juveniles grown in the fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles.
Latvenergo Agency LETA informed that the release of fish will continue for the following months - every year 6 300 000 different species of juveniles and larvae are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava basin.
In spring and early summer 2016, pike and lamprey larvae will be released, in June - sunny, in July - single summer salmon, in August and September - zander and vimba.
Māris Kuņickis, Latvenergo Production Director, told that taking care of the environment is one of the cornerstones of sustainable development of the Latvenergo Group.
"Each activity is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, performing both the rearing of juvenile fish and the streeting of the Daugava basin, as well as implementing other activities," said Kuņickis.
This year more than 600 000 annual salmon and sea trout juveniles will be introduced into the river Daugava estuary.
For the second year already, juvenile fish are marked by cutting off a greaves before being introduced.
Today, there are 25 000 salmon juveniles with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in the composition and numerical extent of scientifically justified species in the Daugava and its basin water bodies, the release of juveniles and larvae takes place.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies in accordance with the laws and regulations is carried out by Bior on the basis of the assessment of losses caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo's economic activity and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environmental Service, on the basis of the above-mentioned expertise, takes a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo annual compensation amount in the fish resource recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In spring 2016 Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We for Fish" for the fifth year, places 400 artificial fish spawning nests in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile.
Cooperation with the association by promoting the natural spawning of fish is an initiative additionally supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the fish resource recovery programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
The festival "Sansusie Concert Hall" has a rural courtyard, forest, circus.
Sleep in a tent, eating like in a restaurant, walking in a kennel and listening to an investigation of chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in San Suzi, which already for the third summer invites to the Heirge district.
The festival will take place in Susēja - no longer existing villagers - in the courtyard of the former parish house, next to forests and courtyards.
In three days - from August 12 to 14 - five stages can combine carefree natural and academic music exquisite pleasures.
Here theater and the contemporary circus, performances and installations meet with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of the concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but only a few minutes to smile and lightness.
"Please don't look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people don't go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sanzuses can only be captured by spending all three days there," invites the initiator and host of the festival, operabariton Armands Siliņš.
The festival's gate is open on Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is open at 19.00.
Of course, there will be programs on the ground with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9.00 a.m. to the next dawn.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv," told by Armands Siliņš.
For example, violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Kristīne Blaumane, operazvaigzne Inga Kalna, clarnetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quartets Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian acrobate Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Eriks Kiršfelds, Martins Zilberts and actress Anci Strazds has created contemporary circus performance Confine as an artist's inner fight.
New works have also been created specially for the festival.
The performance includes children "Kukainis" who, after F. Kafka, are composed of Oļesja Kozlovskis and Jēkabs Nīmanis, along with Armands Siliņš, musicians and actors will be accompanied by entomologist (insect researcher) Uģis Piterans.
Oskars Herliņš has composed the first String Quartet, while Anna Ķirse - the Tree Opera, a performance whose main characters in Andris Kalnozola's management with Katrina Neiburg's video projects and Andra Eglītis' scenography will be trees in three small clusters in a three-hectare wide naked cut.
Singing in the voices of Laima Lediņa, Dinars Rudāne and Zigmārs Grašs, they will enter into romantic relationships, just like in the Enlightenment Swedish nature scientist Kārlis Linnejs' study Kokas wedding (1729).
The Rio Olympic Games are launched today by Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, a seven-fight athlete from the Latvian delegation.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will start the 100-metre cross-border race at 3.35 p.m. after Latvia's time, but at 16.50 a high jump competition will be held.

Seven fights will be concluded on Saturday, when long jumps, spears and a 800-metre race will take place.
Before the Olympic Games Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won the Bronze World Championship last year, was mentioned as an Olympic medal opponent.
In May Latvian set a new state record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-fight race in Gecis, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also participated in the 2012 London Olympic Games, when she won the ninth place with the Latvian record.
During the last year and a half, the athlete has corrected the state record four times.
Today at 16 p.m. the start is also planned for the Latvian judo fighter Artūrs Ņikiforenko, who competes in the weight category above 100 kilograms, the first round of the fight with Azerbaijani athlete Ushangi Kukauri.
Judist's gonna be at the career of the first Olympic Games.
The agency LETA already reported that on Thursday in the weight category up to 100 kilograms lost already in his first fight was the Latvian judo fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko.
He yielded to Japani Hagu Rjunoski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000 Vsevolods Zelony brought the Olympic Bronze Award to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic Games, the Judiists of Latvia won only one victory in the seven fights that Borodavko did in London.
At 16.30 after Latvia's time, Dainis Upelnieks will start shooting, but the selection will end on Saturday.
Upelnieks received the Olympic sign only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later he discovered to the agency LETA that he had been quite safe to drive since April.
The sportsman arrived at the Olympics venue as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of the training opportunities in the event.
At 19.05. after the end of the Latvian time, three trips will be carried out by the debutant of the Olympic Games, a 17-year-old Latvian sailor, Kathy Birzule, who competes in the sailing of windboards in RS:X class.
After three days or nine trips Birzule is currently in 25th place in overall assessment among 26 athletes.
On Saturday, the final event for medals will take place.
Today, it is also planned to take part in the academic rowing competition, where the Latvian representative of Ireland, Sanita Pušpure, will participate.
On Wednesday, the competition was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
Pušpure at 19.10 will compete in C/D semi-finals single ladies, fighting for the 13th place in Olympics.
On Tuesday, on a quarter-final trip, she won the fourth place, from a third position, which would allow her fight for the medal to continue, falling behind by a mere 0.65 seconds.
Pušpure won the 13th place four years ago in London, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, the Olympic Games will be divided into 24 sets of medals - archery, athletics, trekking, riding, trimming, trampling, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected as President, she will appoint Garland as the judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate's Democratic Party, Harry Reid, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party of the Senate has blocked the approval of Garland since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Mitch Maconnel, the leader of the majority of the Senate, told that the next president would choose who would replace the current judge of the Supreme Court Antonina Skalia.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid announced that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later announced that he had not personally spoken to Clinton on this subject and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a different choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Columbian District Court of Appeal.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "goods" and act on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not suitable for the President's work.
Treats announces a naked photo calendar for women and men.
The magazine Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar in the style of Pirreli in the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU Music calendar it is planned to show new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, Steve Shaw, president of Treats magazine, stated that his erotic art magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a male magazine."
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about the calendar.
In a press release on the creation of a calendar, Shaw says: "We have to return to the images of a permanent and classic nakedness, where the female body does not confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos electronically or personally at boxing sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video survey

Shark explorer Julius Neilsen says that a long - life record belongs to a female who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejects the claim to break down stores in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request by the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of self-established shops and restaurants in the Jungle Camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the hearing in Calais this week, the authorities indicated that the State should demolish 72 self-made shops where people sell various goods in the camp area, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea by 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some Euro self-made restaurants.
In Calais, the Prefect Office pointed out that these self-established companies must be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small companies are important because the food provided by the government and support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, in which the number of inhabitants continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille Court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have created 72 self-established shops, but it understands the concerns of Calais's prefect.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food for people who live in "extremely humble conditions."
He pointed out that these places were peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids camp, which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French language classes and advice on asylum issues for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of a children's cafe.
In a letter addressed to the Guardian, it was stated that the liquidation of the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charity organizations "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the population of the jungle camp had increased to 9000 people, the highest rate since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain acquires silver rugby-7 series when Fiji's state unit skillfully wins gold.
The impressive performance of the British team in the Rugby-7 series ended on Thursday, when in an exciting final battle at Deodoro Stadium, Rio Fiji's national team convincingly destroyed them with a result of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in the management of the ball, the ball plays with its foot, a support game and a brutal game of strength, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
Sakāve brought an honorable consolation prize - the silver medal, which was the third British medal that day. The British team can be proud of its success in the first Olympic Rugby-7 tournament in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard fight in the semifinals, where the Boks team defeated with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably played back to Britain in the finals.
But in any case, Fiji's team is now at its best to win a team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, a certain comfort for Britain could be the fact that at least one British won a gold medal. It is Fiji's chief coach of the selection of the Fijian team Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all the games in rugby-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Salvation is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started a match, repressing Britain's power for joy.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his companions were confronted with multiple buses and the World Series champions took the lead at 5:0 when Osea Collinisa was first grounded.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased its predominance by making the right-wing landing a reality.
The result 12:0 and the British team were not even really touched by the bomb.
Mitchell's great power did not allow the insurgent Leoni Nakarava to score three points, but this only slightly influenced Fiji's result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Yas Veremalua was grounded in the right corner, strengthening the predominance over Britain to 17:0.
After the replay, Nakarava increased its predominance even further and had remained more than a minute by the end of the first half-time.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward British forces and crossed the line to score points.
Landing yielded a result of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were still studying.
In fact, it is true.
Britain's team made a big change in half-time, breaking Fiji's player line... full four minutes, which was good at the first half-time standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, scored a few more points for Fiji's team.
Dan Norton managed to score for the British team, making a landing on the left corner and achieving a score of 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of the South Sea island sang, waved the flags and danced in the stands.
You can't admire Fiji's joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
At the end of the game, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British could sit in the grass after their defeat.
In the first half of the day, the semi-final Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce struggle both teams got down the ground and South Africans lost only a few points.
During the first half, Kyle Brown placed Boks under the command of the team, and during the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant skill and took the ball between the poles, providing victory for the British.
Markus Watson, who is the brother of England's Rugby-15 team player Antony, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach's fight with cancer has inspired Helen Glover and Heter Staning to win rowing competitions.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last moment of cancer, Helena Glover and Heather Staning played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by Robin Williams' echo, which inspired them to obtain the second Olympic gold medal for rowing pairs for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to succeed.
They were undoubtedly dominating because for the 39th time they won an unrivaled, unprecedented victory.
As the two great athletes glide along the water surface with a swan elegance, they do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal gained, there is a team working hard to continuously improve their performance and the biggest contribution to their success was made by a coach who did not know until 30 months ago whether he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated and so happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become out of control.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams discovered cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 intermediate season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if any.
I needed income, so I needed to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and walked 6, 10, and even 15 meters long distances, even though the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
It all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After winning, the first thought immediately was about Williams, who was very worried all morning and talked more than usual.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The last 3 years of Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better trainer or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning have not lost any races for five years.
The couple are reaching such an enormous speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, the predominance of Staning and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We succeeded in a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
That day, we didn't have the intention of overthrowing the records, but it was just good to row and win the race, and we did it.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the wedding of the Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
For the time being, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I took about six months to realize that I was the Olympic Champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time, it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

The Head of the State Revenue Service of Kolegovu will be "directed to the last."
According to him, now Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (Green and Farmers' Union) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union) are already "generally important" to approve candidate Koļegov as Head of the State Revenue Minister.
Rajevskis estimated that both Kučinskis and Reizniece-Ozola in this government approval of the Head of the SRS is "the first big decision," which can affect their future as politicians.
If now it starts to change the position of the SRS Head in the selection of the candidate, then it will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The agenda of the next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of transfer of the Head of the VVD Kolegova to the post of the Director-General of the SRS, according to the agenda of the government.
Koļegovu was promoted to the position of Head of the State Revenue Minister Reizniece-Ozola after Ināra Pētersone resigned from the management of the service and when the competition for the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service ended without a result.
In an interview with the Head of the State Revenue Service in Dace Pelēka on Thursday, 11 August, Latvian Radio admitted - if she was offered to stand for the position of head, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance, however, later admitted that he did not examine other candidates for the post of Head of the State Revenue Service.
Raivis Dzintars, Head of the Saeima faction of the National Association, also admitted that NA continues to support Kolegov under the leadership of the SRS.
In Spain, the failure to establish a government is a threat to the reduction of the deficit.
On 12 July a month ago, the European Commission (EC) issued its opinion that Spain and Portugal have not taken sufficient measures to bring the deficit level down to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
It is estimated that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the nearest time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not yet impose sanctions against these two countries is the increasing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase this negative mood.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then unable to apply them in life.
Thus, for example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, giving the people the impression that the European Union rules are recommendive, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for correcting the deficit to the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial projections suggest that Portugal's target could be achieved in due course and the budget deficit could already fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, this country's government must implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the budget deficit should be brought down to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and in 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, in the next two years, consolidation measures should be at 0.5% of GDP each year.
The fact that, for eight months now, the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming increasingly likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the third elections would also not significantly change the political picture in the country.
The most popular party is still the popular party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rachoja, whose wish would again receive less than 33% of the votes.
Only socialists have slightly increased their popularity, while the popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" has slightly diminished.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialist and Ciudadanos into government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
According to Rafael Hernando, a representative of the parliamentary faction of the People's Party, if the government fails to establish itself and parliamentary elections are still held for the third time, Spain will become a pan-European ridicule.
The purity of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
During the fifth year of the survey of beaches, activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found is growing every year, and most bathing sites are to blame for this.
The most polluted bathing sites are in Riga.
The capital city council explains that bathing sites are cleaned up every day, but it is difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land can be rinsed into water during rainfall, thus damaging its quality considerably.
Apart from Liepāja beach and separate places in Kurzeme, purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement has been distributed this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
During the fifth year walking along the Gulf of Riga, activists concluded that the amount of waste left by residents has increased every one hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year's assessment of the fall has come to pass.
"We see that this will be the year when the amount of waste per beach 100 meters, may even exceed 200 units," says Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea."
Latvian Radio has been called, he was on the Tūja beach, where the voluntary march along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, even daylight lamps left in the sand of the sea have been collected between various household waste and picnic remains by activists.
The tour participant and organizer Ulme says that people are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already at the stage of degradation, can no longer be identified, and the smokers, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirty beaches there are also bathing sites in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva, almost 800 units of waste were collected on average every one hundred metres, which is critical.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that, almost every step, they also mock and not everywhere have signs of warning or prohibition.
"The average figures for all three swimming places in Riga together - Daugavgrīva, Evening Birthdays and Vecķis - unfortunately come large and far beyond the desired or goal, to which Latvia seems to be heading, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020" concludes the environmental advocate.
Bathing cleaning in Riga takes place daily, even twice on the hottest summer days, explains Uģis Vidauskis, representative of the City Council.
However, the struggle with unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who embellish, drink alcohol, smoke and do all the things that cannot, even special signs do not work," Vidauskis points out.
Therefore, Vidauskis invites bathing visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Maybe new warnings can be imposed, but as I said, it is hardly going to radically change the situation.
"Since everyone together simply has to go and be intolerant of such offenders," he stresses.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can ban official bathing areas.
This year, like other years, the quality of water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has always been good and there are no restrictions on bathing.
"For the last time we take analyses at the end of August," says Normunds Kadiķis, senior environmental health inspector.
During heavy rainfall, the waste left on land can be flushed into water.
This in turn may affect its quality, indicated by an environmental professional.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - change of the head of Putin's administration.
Did he leave his office?
Vladimir Putin has announced to the Russian media that Sergei Ivanovs wanted to leave this post himself and will now be the President's special representative on nature protection, ecology and transport issues.
In announcing the changes, Putin paid tribute to Ivanovs in front of the television cameras: "The beloved Sergey Borisovič, we have been working together with you for many years and are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you carry out your duties.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this post of Head of the President's Administration for more than four years.
That is why I am understanding about your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in your new position you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the leadership of the President's administration is a very important position and has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the forthcoming elections of the State Council in Russia next month, rumours have been voiced that this step is linked to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanovs was also called a potential substitute for Putin's position as President, so the claim that he himself wanted to occupy the position of President's representative in matters of nature protection and transport raised doubts.
According to Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the general officer of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an ancient and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became Head of Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Information Security doctrine" was confirmed, which included the revitalisation of the state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 he was Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the post of Head of the President's Administration, Ivanovs will also keep a seat on the Russian National Security Council, where now the new Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, will also work.
The blame comes from the family's Soviet party in the elite.
The post of Head of the President's Administration in Vaino was recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have been familiar for a long time.
From the time we worked as a government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years, we've been communicating practically every day.
"That's why I'm sure that by all his professional and personal qualities he's ready for this work," he said.
The blame comes from the family belonging to the Soviet party elite.
His grandfather, Karl, has held senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, was its first secretary.
The online publication "Meduza" with reference to the book "The self-determination and independence of Estonia" says that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to be allowed to use force against demonstrators.
However, he received a refusal and soon lost his post.
Shortly thereafter, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute for International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's protocol.
It has already been reported that Russia has been shaken by the suspension and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives from several districts.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin reorganizes the ruling elite before the 2018 elections.
One of the main features is the increasing number of representatives of power structures in leading positions.
Juddo's fighter, Nikiforenko, also loses the Olympic Games' first fight.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has concluded his participation in the Olympic Games by finishing 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskin admitted to Latvian Television that there was very little hope for Ņikiforenko, and it was already clear before the competition.
He also discovered that Judo's fighter had suffered shoulder injury.
Significantly, in order to get off the Olympic road signs, Ņikiforenko had to compete in a different weight category than usual - that is, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan's fight was 25 kilos heavier.
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko stood up to 100 kilograms in the weight category against Rjunosuke for two and a half minutes until the opponent managed to make a net victory.
Thus, Latvia's judo race in Rio has finished.
Dreams disappear in Rio's sand.
Judis Yevgeny Borodavko entered the Thursday.
Yes, he had a more senior opponent, but the ambitious can sometimes surprise him.
He didn't get it.
Artūrs Ņikiforenko's task was even more complicated, because the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectable.
The result was similar, even though he stayed on the Tatami for almost one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, recently Latvian judiciaires lack the most ambition.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons went on the side of the federation's leadership and his financial studio Vladimirs Šestakovs, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, "Golden Score" no longer exists - the development of judo takes place along a downward curve.
Jackevich, who advises the judistus of Kazakhstan here, and Vsevold Zelony doesn't see the heirs.
But if he doesn't grow, he won't.
And this is the prerogative of the Federation.
That's why the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to win medals from another galaxy in the "Morning Panorama."
A flight far from reality.
In the evening we looked forward to beach volleyball match Samoilov/Smēdiņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as in the "death" group - the losers of the game ended.
The duet of Latvia had a small departure - it could also lose, but no more than four points in two sets.
The tension was further enhanced by the long-standing previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy cortex hinged over the entire length of the match.
The gusting wind caused additional difficulties for players.
At first, it seemed that it could be our ally, which is more comprehensive.
But he didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serve so on Samoilov and wait for him to rupture.
Canada was cracked, Cuba was broken at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third set, because the load was no joke.
He could go fishing at that time, because there was little work, but when it was, he did it honorably.
Brazilian Samoilov and Smēdiņš could win in two sets, because the first took over the leadership with 16:15, but at 16, he also stayed, also ridiculing the lost point limit.
But it could have been lost also by 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind it was possible to win.
The third was already in the Evander Serve drawing.
There was a chain - an unconvincing serve, the second pass often goes too close to the network, and Samoilov left few options for a successful attack.
If there was some unfamiliar Samoilov against the Cubans in the square, then this time he was more successful, and it would only be unprofessional to shift the loss to Sasha.
The Kremlin too was wrong, and enough symbolically, that the last block of bombs was hit by him.
Lose the team.
There was certainly a lack of success this time - in the third set, only two Evander attacks almost flew out of the court, but the bomb still hit the line.
Two wells were next to the line.
The controversial episode in the video also decided in favor of the opponents.
In the first two games, if Evandra was tormented with servings, it was very productive for ours.
The whole sum summed up in the loss on the tab.
The causes of failure must now be analysed calmly.
Perhaps it was like living next to a stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours.
Maybe a little bit of self-confidence was given by the seven semi-finals series.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but sooner come here and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a failure to find the top of the sporty form.
So far, more questions than answers.
The game's over for our beekeepers.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left, as well as Jurmala Masters.
Smēdiņš and Samoilovs have never been friends in life and will not be like that, because they are too different personalities.
But it's not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce can also arise, because the blame will be sought not only within itself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much more difficult to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play a bee, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to begin conquering the top of the world.
You can try Harald Regze, Aleksandrs Solovejs, Edgars Točs, to return to Mārtiņš Pļaviņš, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself not only once during the World Cup stages.
Copacabana's sand did not smile at them this time.
That's it.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples enter the circulation, and only the rare height is less than two meters.
This does not guarantee success yet, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Ours doesn't stay longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the venues offered by the organizers, as well as choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not remain in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, the rather modest accommodation offered to journalists was subject to much exaggeration of prices.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the apartment rent.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time, the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the border between Copacabana and Ipanema.
Beach 200 meters away, bee arena in half an hour's walk.
The district is safe enough, because the fairway, but the alertness must not be lost here either.
Vladimirs Vladimirovičs is not what some immediately think about, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanovs.
P.S. Looks like another dream of medals was dreamed out on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa was lagging behind her personal records in a 100-metre obstacle race and high jump.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgy and Besa" can be heard in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the first study of opera "Porgijs un Besa" took place in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeatedly performed.
That is why the organisers of the Cēsis Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin's masterpiece.
"We are very happy that after a 10-year break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the opera production for the last time, this great version of the opera concert by George Gershwin "Porgijs un Besa" can be enjoyed with us at the new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber," says Baiba Bože, the director of the concert hall "Great Amber."
Opera "Porgy and Besa" is a vivid musical story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this opera that this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairišs.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera is always the points - the famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one person or another person, or choir, or orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, this building," the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor Andris Poga of the concert of opera "Porgijs un Besa."
The visitors of the opera agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are delighted to hear this world-famous Guershwin opera.
Blessed is that Liepaja can feel the world's breath.
"Execution Professional," the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special because for the first time the orchestra played in the orchestra in the new open concert hall "Great Amber" and for the first time an opera performance took place.
The square near the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
Andris Ameriks, Vice-President of Riga, announced at the opening of the Rozentāls anniversary exhibition that the museum's own address in the future could be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Janis Rozentāls laukums 1.
Māra Lāce, the director of the museum, admitted that re-registration of the address would create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea was welcomed and therefore agreed with the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga has laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936 by creating a Burkarda Dzen's monument to Janis Rozentāls, who stands at the museum.
The museum director Wilhelm Purvītis was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I have a little conscience all the time, but Wilhelm Purvītis, where will we put his name?!
"But if you promise to think, Mr. America," said Lace.
It has been reported that the building of the National Museum of Art officially opened its doors in May this year after an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation.
This week, the VEF Culture Palace will finally be reconstructed.
The castle will be renovated by "Velve" Ltd. for approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to restore several rooms of the castle, including two auditoriums, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract six million euros of money from European Union funds to the project, however, Oļegs Burovs, Director of Property Department of Riga City Council, admits that the project is not fully clear yet with European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairing the VEF Culture Palace by attracting the European Structural Funds is, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from the Ministry of Finance officials, will be given it money or not," Burov says.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you would make your own decision that Brussels did not take a decision here.
We are now seeing another circle of discussions emerging again, so we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines," Burov points out.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively organized a farewell concert before the immediate renovation of the building.
Despite a year later, renovation of the building was still not started and continued to work collectively under unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction work sets, where each will ensure implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is increasing the accessibility of VEF Culture Palace and improvement of the surrounding area.
It is planned to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
Second - improvement of VEF Culture Palace service offer.
It plans to restore the building's interior, walls and ceiling, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the building's internal engineering communications.
Third - Improvement of working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" you can get to know the legendary rock group at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various objects characteristic of "Līvus" - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activities are announced.
Participants' stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen to the general public, reflecting the creative work of the group "Līvi."
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects from Liepaja Museum collection.
The exhibition's visual design was created in collaboration with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians who have been associated with the band "Līvi" and their relatives also responded to the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be found in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pavitols, is created in Liepāja Culture House.
Ansamblis participated in the festival "Liepājas amber" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavitols met Ēriks Ķīģelis and Metalurgs established a group in the cultural palace, inviting Ingrīda Gūtmanis, Andris Krūziņš and Jānis Grodums to join.
Over the years, the group's composition has changed more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and survive - remains unchanged.
"What to see was no shortage - jeans, hairs and beardies, these boys were quite different from the stereotype of the popular stage singer," says musician Klass Vāvere about the band.
In addition to the musicians mentioned above, there have been such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācenājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Kleins and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27 in Liepāja concert garden "Pūt, vējiņi" will be held the 40th anniversary celebration of the band "Līvi" "LĪVIfest 2."

Zbigņevs Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is rising.
Zbigņevs Stankevičs, archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, emphasizes in his interview that if we want to gain the strength of life, the Gospel message should be placed in its center.
For the power of truth is greater than that of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Assumption Festival of the Most Holy Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the pope's nuncius has expressed a desire to lead the main worship in Aglona.
It is therefore up to him to have the main message.
It has also turned out to be a kind of tradition that the path of the Cross is guided by Bishop Jānis Bulis.
He will also form his own message.
On the previous day, I am conducting a festive vigil service.
Last year I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato si and updated the common house, Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world and trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Gospel message should be put at the heart of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and inspires him on the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in Cēsis, in the Lamp discussion, you said, "you have to come back to the understanding of the full person."
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the church's message?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
In India's capital, a dying man is robbed of the road.
No one in the capital of India seemed aware of a man dying on the side of the road - it turns out that he was lying on the side of the road for an hour and then robbed, reports the BBC.
A man identified as Matibuel has been reported to drive rickshaw during the day, but at night he worked as a security guard.
Matiboul, at 5:30 a.m., went home on the road when he was hit by a car.
The recording of surveillance cameras shows that the driver has stepped out of the car to look at the victim, and then left.
An hour later, when no one seemed to know about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a long man.
About 90 minutes after the crash, the police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died from the injuries.
Recalling his candidacy as Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), Inga Kolegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, has saved the government from falling, according to Ojārs Skudra, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
The explanation by Colegov of the withdrawal of candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
In a conversation with the agency LETA, the constellation said that it was hard for him to imagine that next week at the government session "Unity" would support the candidacy of Kolegowa.
Thus, if the Ministers of "Unitedness" voted against, but Kolegov would still be confirmed in office, this would lead to the government's demise.
The expert also believes that prior to the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Prime Minister Maris Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also a concession to the "Union," which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When forecasting whether it would be possible to find a suitable candidate by means of a competition, Skudra admitted that there were two options: either a compromise figure will be chosen or the institution will continue to be managed in Dace Peleka as the acting Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance had so far claimed that no other candidacy had been considered, it was a hint to the Greek that it was not allowed to take part in the tender.
LETA already reported that Kolegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the SRS.
On Tuesday, due to opposition to "Unity," the government postponed the approval of Kolegov as Director General of the SRS for a week.
After the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that he was still ready to become the Head of the SRS.
However, later the thoughts changed - in her submission to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, on Friday she pointed out that she withdrew her consent to the transfer to the position of Head of the State Revenue Service and this is not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Māra Kučinska Andrejs Vaivars explained to the agency LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director-General of the SRS.
In the center of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
This afternoon, there was a road traffic accident in the centre of Riga involving the State Police car.
The police car has rushed with sound and light signals to the highest category of call, until Krišjāņa Barona and Dzirnavu street crossroads collide with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information indicates that the other vehicle has not missed a police car.
A woman has suffered an accident.
This year the number of inhabitants in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, the agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capital cities of the European Union (EU) and large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to data from the EU statistical office "Eurostat," Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly top of Europe's largest cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capital cities of the Baltic States have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123 women and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
A warning pictogram will be provided at the LNMM.
Warning signs - pictograms - will be placed next to the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), Baiba Gailīte, a representative of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, told the agency LETA.
Currently, the repair of damage to the glazed atrium of the museum, which was created as a result of skateboarding, has been successfully completed.
Alert pictograms will be placed near it in the coming days.
Its inhabitants will be told that the surface is slippery during rain and snow, it is not allowed to travel by cars, as well as to ride bicycles, roller skates and skateboards.
Ušakovs wrote about this on the social network "Facebook" at the time, who said that no safety hazards are caused by damage, but "does not appear to be accurate," and skateboarders "will have to be driven."
Festivals for children and parents - new playgrounds for children have been created in Riga.
In this summer season Riga Municipality has installed two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Chiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
The Ķīpsala beach has a spacious, multifunctional toy vessel with various climbing elements, bridges, games, trubs and slides.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The area also has swings and various balancing elements.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is enriched by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
In turn, a house, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastic area with rings of power and coordination trainings, footballs and other sports elements, are installed in the playground between the 4th and 5th crossroads of Chiekurkalns.
Under the area is covered rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colorful pavement has been laid up to the playground from the street.
The game reveals the reconstructed section of the road.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of SJSC Latvijas Valsts ceļš (LVC), as well as representatives of construction workers SIA "Binders" and local governments today opened the reconstructed section of the state main road Russian border (Grebņeva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to Lithuanian border (range 1506,4-163,05 km).
Roads are a national business card, especially border roads, so it is a particular satisfaction to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the country's main roads is improving.
"As forecasts show, during this planning period the funds available for roads will be learned already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue to maintain the most busy roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of residents in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union," Uldis Augulis emphasized by turning the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvia's roads in the nearest time will be presented to the government.
Construction works from Medums to Lithuanian border (156.4-163,05 km) SIA Binders started last year and this year they were continued after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed section of the road has been completely restored and repair works will be started in the next stage from Honey to Daugavpils, so the entire road from Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," said Janis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The country's main roads are the most busy and by 2018, we intend to get all the country's main roads in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance and to change the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, need adequate funding, and all travellers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to clean up the road financing system," said Lange.
Road connections and lighting have been arranged within the framework of the project.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four stages large-scale recreation and large-scale eavesdropping and embankment works, a smoothed longitudinal profile of the road, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and the conversion area for public transport has been re-built.
In the past, the road was underperforming and the terrain was not clear because of hilly valleys, as well as the old road of common terrain.
In the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144.80.-156.4. km).
This year LVC plans to perform various types of work on more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
Information about all planned repairs on the national road network this year is available on the website of LVC www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, the right choice of food combinations is very important," admits Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kukleriene.
It is also easy to do during the summer period when fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A careful combination of nutritional products can help not only to reduce overweight but also to promote various body processes in a targeted way.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Research published in the European Clinical Nutritional Journal has shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel encouraged.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, not only creates a sense of satie, but also reduces the desire for large meals for the next meals.
Such a combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help get rid of the layer of fat in the abdomen.
The eggs contain a metabolism-enhancing nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Ingestion of sufficient amounts of these nutrients can reduce cortisol levels, thus also the accumulation of fat around the middle part of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, to which fresh berries have been added, is another delicious and fat burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in its menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber, which, according to Canadian scientists, controls the grelin - appetite stimulating hormone - and thus the feeling of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are helpers in weight reduction, as well as prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to accomplish miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a sense of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the sense of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestion process and provide a long-term sense of satiety.
At lunch you can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
Which product combinations should be avoided.
The fruit contains sugars, monosaccharides or disaccharides, one or two molecules.
On the other hand, starch in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit breaks down into the stomach mechanically and does not chemically decompose until it reaches the third or fourth degree of digestion that occurs in the intestine.
The starch breaks down into three different stages, beginning in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
Eat the sweet food immediately after the meal, it is blocked in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and starts to bulge.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate products together with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, which is found in saliva, acts only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit carbohydrate digestion, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
They require different digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and time to reach the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelone, muskatmelone and other melons must always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are present in the stomach with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats make a successful combination of starch, but the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fat prevents protein digestion.
Proteins can be combined with very small amounts of fat.
If you consume a lot of protein products, avoid the use of fat altogether.
This also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contains protein) with whole avocados (contains fat).
Such combination prevents effective weight loss.
How to cook better?
"Eat preparation, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient content of the products," says dietist.
In most cases, nutrients are lost when cooking food in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by cooking.
After cooking vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for soup preparation - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables, including by steaming them.
Cooking significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
By boiling the tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
The heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beticarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins contained therein, making them more digestible.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, while the freezing of fibre does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better functioning of the brain and muscles.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blooded iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy herbs, cereal products, than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blooding iron in the body by eating non-blooding iron products together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blooding iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen delivery to muscles and the brain.
To maximise the benefit of salads, add healthy fats, such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add to the vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines without an added yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the gut and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with vitamin C sources, such as strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilise cholesterol levels as well as to avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized for aches' caricking
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity in a rather absurd way.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog, or an image that fits in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are foggy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million converted selfies per day.
Any error quickly becomes public noticeable.
The effects of the Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past by being accused that the application promotes too black or light skin tones as a benchmark of ideal beauty.
This week's new lens effects were published, which allow users to create blasphemy eyes, blasphemy teeth and round cheeks, and some critics described it as a racist Asian cartoon.
It was also asked whether such contradictions would not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public adversities broke out on Wednesday, when spending on "The Verge" and "Motherboard" said that the lens effects had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to depict the images of Anime, not to carick people of Asian origin.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
In an e-mail, she states that the effects of the lens are "harmful and uncomfortable, not to say more."
She added that it was difficult to see the obvious similarities between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the lens's effect is not simply yellow face, but yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large youth audience, representing different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, "these things don't go unnoticed today," said 25-year-old Katie Jou in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday the product manager of Medium Jou deleted his Snapchat application and advised others to do the same.
In her article in Medium and in a telephone interview, she explained that she felt that the problems of race were due to Snapchat's employment policy, which was insufficiently supportive of racial diversity.
João criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded its article with the reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are made. Whether there are some other racial representatives in the company, but they do not hold such a position as to be able to express their opinion safely and conveniently," says Chinese-American Jou.
Others share her opinion, while Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on the representation of racial minorities who were not widely represented and who would contribute to the company's integration.
Jou, on the other hand, will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right."
The Congress Chamber announces that military officials misrepresent reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Chamber of Congress states that representatives of the US Central Command have distorted the reports by depicting the war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
The Central Command Intelligence Analysts express their general dissatisfaction with the provisional report of the task force established by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the representatives of the Republicans of the Defence Financing Sub-Committee, indicating that their leadership controlled the reports on American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report reveals that the intelligence reports, confirmed by senior Centcom leaders, reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than is actually the case. The facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses suggest.
Ken Kalvert, a representative of the Republics of California, says: "Centcom's behaviour is unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom's management errors lie in the organisation's top management.
This 10-page report shows in detail the ongoing problems in the presentation and analysis of the Central Command of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of Obama's administration have distorted reports, it shows that Centcom's leadership has put some pressure on analysts to display a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic state (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015 the central management press releases, statements and reports to Congress represented the situation in a significantly more positive light than was the case in reality.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly announced that the recovery operation for Mosul could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under the Islamic State Control.
Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Kansas Republican Party, states in his report: 'More months of investigation is a clear indication of this'.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, key US Central Administration officials distorted the reports by depicting the ISIS threat in Iraq weaker than they were in fact.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic state is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence investigates the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
Members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Management Committee published their own report on Thursday in which they agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party Working Party.
In his report, the Democratic Representative Adams B. Shifs states that between 2014 and 2015, Centcom too restricted the preparation of intelligence assessments reports in relation to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Šifs explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information," worsened the ethics of analysts' work, and "dissemination of false facts'.
But Shif and the members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports according to the 'pre-determined or political position'.
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspector initiated investigations following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, the Pentagon representative, announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the congress report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Administration call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism with regard to the intelligence of the Islamic State is reminiscent of events more than ten years ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study saying that the administration of George W. Bush started the Afghan war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hooker also played an important role in the opening of the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hooker team found that, contrary to public reports, air flights to Islamic State oil factories had not significantly worsened the financial situation of a terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of September reported that this discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Authority.
The commander of the moment, General Lloyd Austin III, at Centcom, received sharp criticism, because many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April General Austin retired, and General Joseph Waterl took his place.
In the U.S. duel with Britain in women's field hockey, wins the U.S., thus winning the fourth win in a row.
The day after winning over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Katie Bama scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when Americans defeated the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bama said that she couldn't remember if she had ever succeeded.
She said, "I have no idea."
I am not one of the people who counts their goals.
But she knows that the American score at the Olympic Games is 4:0, which gives them in their group a draw with Britain, which on Thursday after winning over Japan with a score of 2:0 remained unconquered.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in first round games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final and the game will only determine which team will take first place in the group of six teams and which second.
The winner of the first place will be a little longer to avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch team, the leader of the second group.
In spite of Saturday's game, Americans have already called the storm of surprises, four years ago they took the last place in London among 12 teams.
That team also included Bama
She grew up in Blubel, she first took a field hockey bat in her hands at the age of 3 (his oldest twin sisters were already doing this sport in Dreksel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the most important player in the history of the team.
She wasn't on the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get into the finals.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year, English Crag Parham was appointed as a team coach and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
We didn't invest as much work in London as we do now.
We have changed everything.
On Thursday's game Bama discovered the result, getting the goal in the first half-time with the rear throw from a close distance.
India started the game without winning its account, but their selection was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama repeatedly scored the goal.
She entered the ball into the anti-union area on the left side of the field, then noticed to get to the middle part of the field and send the ball into the anti-union gate, putting Americans under 2:0 leadership.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa González scored another goal.
This was the first U.S. goal guard Jackie Briggs dry game, placing one gate in each of the first three games.
She's insane.
And also Bama.
"We're going very well right now," said Paham, but how right, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing food during the depression period is "Speed meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted such delicate culinary delicacies as goose-liver pâté, or fuagra, and Mariland tortoise soup.
On that day, however, his meal was much more modest - filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and a plum pudding in dessert.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way of solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard."
Her husband, Andrey Koo, adds: "It's also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
The last book of Kou describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane describes life through food in the rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan in her book "97 Ābeles."
Their new joint work, "Sustainable meal," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing a degree of solidarity in cooking, they held a meal together by the reporters "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop," a simple lunch eater located in the district of Flatiron and running from 1929 when the major depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered turkey, potato puree and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered the forgeries, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for the conversation about the dishes of the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the forgeries were very popular.
There was a hare of peanuts, a hare of liver, and a hare of beans.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients as well as other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it is like to eat enough peanuts to replace lunch.
Mr. Kou blew off.
"It probably seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
During the years of pre - depression, the American lunch table resembled a Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat for their husbands and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly prepared roasts.
During the first World War, it was the Americans who sent Europeans food. The "Sturdy meal" describes how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the main focus of the American people's daily life," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write on this subject.
The new budget diets became equally important: such unknown foods as forgeries and stews became everyday, stews were "a great way to use surpluses," said Mrs Ziegelmane, because cooks could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
The fresh fruit was replaced by the cheaply dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury commodity.
At a time when caloric numbers and nutritional value were more important than taste, new, yet unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making groundnut butter-filled onions.
Mr Kou adds: 'It was not a popular addition to the lunch table'.
Mrs Ziegelmane points out: 'It was surreal'.
Peanut butter and bake onion are incompatible.
Many recipes of home dishes adapted to difficult times.
Household economists, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Economy Bureau from 1923 to 1943, determined the country's eating habits that had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that housewives become "economists" and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into a delicious meal.
"Sturdy Meal" is a historic delicacy feast.
Particularly interesting are the evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
Although publicly speaking about his simple childhood and feeding in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely removed from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleonora, had not advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt hired a domestic servant who didn't know how to cook, so White House became a place "where not only one of the most delicious dishes was served in Washington, but also the worst prepared dishes."
Once the country's economy recovered, most of the culinary habits of the depressive era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelmane.
A couple say that when writing a book, they got a better understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane's mother's eating habits, for example, why she couldn't throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs Ziegelmane said: 'She actually taunted people'.
Once there was an incident with wind cakes.
After we had eaten at Eisenberg's eater, a couple of writers pulled out a homemade dessert: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"This is plum cream," said Mrs Ziegelmane, adding that at that time there was a common habit of giving a chic name to modest dishes.
It contains no foam cream, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently soaked the spoon in the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced economist, he said to his wife, "The dried ground hazelnut of the drinker's spear."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck's Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has decided that the Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the legal fees it has paid in the case of the breaking of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was fined GBP 200 million for breaking two of Merck's patents, which threatened it with successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the U.S. federal judge found irregularities in Merk's activities, such as lying after an oath and other unethical acts.
On Thursday's trial, U.S. district judge Bet Labson Freeman indicated that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses he had incurred in defending the case.
Merck attempts to gain market position against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C medicines, which are effective in 90% of liver disease cases.
The case started already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead.
The forces supported by the US claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbija from the Islamic State.
The forces supported by the US have completely taken control of the city of Manbija in the northern part of the country on the Turkish border, and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a representative of the group announced on Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently clearing the city from the last opponents who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages to the civil population captured by the militants, Reuters said to the news agency Sharphan Darvish from the military council of the SDS's ally Manbija.
"Now the city is under our full control and we are searching for fighters," he informed Reuters.
Clinton's income reached 10.75 million dollars in 2015 and a couple paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton published the 2015 Tax Declaration on Friday showing that the candidate for President of the Democratic Party and her husband earned 10.75 million dollars this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
During 2015, Clintons have donated USD 1 million, mainly to his Clinton charity organization. Former President Bill Clinton has earned some USD 5.3 million as a speaker and former Secretary of State has earned $3 million from his book on his work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
The ally of the Clinton elections - the senator of the state of Virginia of the USA Tim Kein and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax return for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilary Clinton and Tim Kein continue to set new standards of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, partner of the Clinton campaign, in her statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is hiding behind various pretexts and reservations to avoid fulfilling promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but this is not required by law.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason for not disclosing tax information.
"Your move," in her Twitter record, the tax information of the candidate for the Democratic Party was told by Ian Sams, partner of the Clinton campaign.
On Thursday, Trampa's special adviser Michael Kohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audits had been completed.
Trampa's critics, including Mits Romny, President-designate of the Republican Party of 2012, and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about the actual size of his property, the donations and other commitments of his business, including his commitment to Russia.
Clinton added oil to the fire by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans ask Trump to publish their tax information.
She returned again to this issue during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
According to the Polisho, in the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no taxes for two years and on Friday, the author of the New York Times states that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of the proposal of billionaire Varen Buffet, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than 1 million dollars a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Clinton, where his Berckshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffet called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and that Trump was afraid of the electorate, not the tax authority.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chapakv, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton's 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons won $100.000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin for turning off Israel's faraway code at the request of a Arab - RT News
The director of French films of Jewish origin created a storm in social media when he discovered that the code of Israeli long-distance conversations was not available at the Kimpinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Claude Lancman, director of the documentaries about the Holocaust "Shoah," did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin-Kempinski Bristol Hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find Israel's faraway code on the hotel's list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
Writing Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received has shocked him.
The administrator of the hotel explained that "it was a conscious decision to manage the hotel'.
The reason for removing the code was even more angry with the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be erased," Lancman quotes the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this case "a great shame."
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany, it is in this hotel network that there is even more humiliation.
No explanatory notes are required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also gained quite a lot of resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others consider that the Kempinski Hotel was simply used by Arab customers.
Another entry was "shamed," pointing out that the hotel is located on the Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all accusations, declaring that all of this was a "misunderstanding" and apologised to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski's representative.
And adds that the code was added again to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The clash between students and police took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas for students.
Problems started when law enforcement tried to expel students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
Geraldo Alckmina, the Governor of São Paulo, proposes close to 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Timmer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support for the suspended President Dilma Roussefa, whose impeachment was voted by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner is the first to bring Britain a gold medal for cycling
Kelum Skinr from Scotland finished his first men's cycling team at the sprint race in Rio, which took place last night. The British team protected its title of champions, which it won in London games in 2012.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making proud the legendary Scot Sir Chris Hoy and bringing the victory to favorites in New Zealand.
Four years ago Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy had already finished his career as an athlete.
The problems were in the phase between the Beijing and London Olympics, because they had to replace the experienced starter specialist Jamie Staf.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, his place was filled with Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Britain's coaches put their hopes on Skinner, seeing his potential, which he later demonstrated.
Hindus, Kenny - the champions who competed with Hoye and Skinner four years ago, who set the Olympic qualification record, but the competition was a better start for New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hinde's circle was in a tight rig, and Kenny took the lead, and Skinner protected it.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindus drove with more gear to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skinera to drive faster.
Hoye watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindus when they climbed on the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgow said, "It was an incredible honor."
I'm doing everything to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and beat the World Champions.
It was simply incredible.
There's no better win.
After winning with Kenya and Hoye at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindus confessed that they deliberately fell on the track after the failed start.
He later rebutted that comment and the British competitors were unable to prove otherwise.
There were no incidents this time.
The Hindus said: "The British flags in the stands reminiscent of London. "
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so victory in the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will compete for the country, which won seven out of ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya's result, he could indeed repeat Hoya's success in obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, it would mean six gold and one silver medal. Furthermore, Kenny was born on March 23 (it looks as if it was a British sacred date, because Steve Regreve, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born on that day).
Hoy was also born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said, "Now I just enjoy it.
The team ride is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, it's a little lonely to win one."
The Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be nominated as knights."
It was the only fight for medals that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clensie, Steve Burke, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualifying time for four kilometers of four.
Their time was 3:51.943
The World Record, which was set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Viggins will definitely be the focus of attention.
Yesterday before the qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the Commissariat, when the judges called him to measure his body.
During the women's journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trot, Joanna Rowsel Schand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavia set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will, hoping, win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
In the meantime, the technical director Shane Saton has resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton have also finished their careers.
But when the first cycling races begin, it seems that Britain will, as always, reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Refinery is becoming uncertain as an ambitious treaty has been terminated.
The future of the aluminium smelter and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear because its main customer energy company has announced the termination of cooperation.
This statement is based on the Victorian government's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidies will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2 000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2 000 both direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will have unpredictable side-effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the paint mill, which led to the decommissioning of the Anglo-based power plant.
The Alkoa Portland smelter works at a loss and can be closed.
These events were triggered by years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production at the factory.
The plant's energy supplier, AGL, who supplies energy from its own "Loy Yang A' power plant in Latroubes Valley, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plants belong to a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumia, in addition to the company's shares, they also belong to Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp. Holding companies.
It hopes that the Portland plant will continue to operate, which would mean a further supply of energy to the fired plant," said its representative.
In November 2016, the Commission received comments from the Belgian authorities on the opening decision, which stated that the contracts were so-called "risk-restrictive contracts', which are expected to enter into force as of November 2016.
Contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
The company also plans to receive revenue from these contracts in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
As from the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market expectations for future wholesale electricity prices.
It argues that in its forecasts, a loss of USD 187 million has already been attributed to the termination of these contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect the ability of Alcoa to continue the melting plant or to supply it with energy.
U.S. company says that in 2010 it concluded a contract with the company "Loy Yang" for 20 years, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not explain why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about the possible closure of the Portland Refinery in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
Last week's executive director Steven Michelson said that, according to analysts, Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy a year.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people every year.
More than 160,000 people's demands are rejected each year, with budget cuts likely to deteriorate.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal extradition - are refused free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overburdened, warns that if funding is reduced, the situation will only get worse.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farel, director of the Queensland Legal Centre, said that the latest report of the Association of National Law Centres states that at present, thousands of people in need of legal aid are refused legal aid.
Mistr Farel pointed out that if this decision was not lifted, the situation would only get worse.
He also says: "Quinsland's legal centre is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need are refused assistance."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who are divorced, workers who are unfairly laid off - all of them have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, which means that a further thousands of citizens of Queensland will have to deal with their difficult legal problems without help.
We call on the Prosecutor General and the Senator George Brandiss of Queensland to stop the reduction immediately so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now it is also time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to invest in this important area by the Palazčuk government.
Donald Trump's campaign has been taken to court because one of the employees has pulled out a firearm
New York: The organizers of Donald Trump's campaign have been sued because they have not acted on the information that its North Carolina operations manager has turned a gun against an employee when they drive in February into one car.
This incident was described in a court action brought on Wednesday in Charlotte Court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months to open an internal hearing on this case, but he realized that this would not happen.
Driver Earle Phillip " pulled out the pistol, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the barrel against Vincent's knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaign managers, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"The guns don't have to shoot to make a loss," says Bordini in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was presented, the Republican candidate for the presidential office caused a scandal, declaring to the people that the "Men of the Second Amendment," i.e. the owners of weapons and enthusiasts, could act if his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges were to win the election.
Tramp campaigners announced that the media had removed his words from the context, and he had never incited violence.
By their request, Bordini wants to recover compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent monitoring, and from Phillips - for attack, illegal use of the weapon and creation of emotional stress.
Trampa's representative, Houpa Hiksa, did not make any comments at once.
Phillips has not been contacted.
WCCB - Charlotte local news agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
Nor has he been able to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services."
The President-designate of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, has conducted a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - parish and sports festival in Ķūļciems.
On Saturday in Ķūļciems people gathered for the first time on the parish and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided that the Lake Festival would be no more.
A new page has now been turned.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, darts had to throw in a sleeping target, the boot flew, the man's left hand fair, "bulbing" was not at all in any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, brave, neat and fruitful he was.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in an open-air stage, where the parish festival started.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner," where the little ones could break up inflatable attractions and get a new image in the face makeup.
The novelty, which could also become a tradition, was a parade of vehicles, where tractors and motorcycles went.
Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, the head of Ķūļciema Parish Administration, who wished a nice rest and dry time, however, the rain did rain, but it could not disturb anything much.
The festival continued with welcoming the youngest inhabitants of Ķūļciems.
It is really good that the parish has been supplemented by five girlfriends and one boy.
The amateur art collectives from Engure region came to the audience with performances - viewers enjoyed the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens rhythms," dance performers of different nations "Reda" and youth dancers "Golden Pearls."
And it's nothing that happened to somebody on the wet stage to slip.
Of course, the famous actors' duet Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Bērzciems from the fishermen's farm "Dieniņa."
The ball was played by the band "Brugs."
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as it did in London in 2012, where we put a huge effort into making all the regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Ieda gained an enormous amount from the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment around Heathrow.
Like the London Olympic Games in 2012, this time there will be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that Heathrow's expansion is too ambitious.
People then said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012 and, in the case of Heathrow, they would not be right either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
Heathrow has a great team that has created an 11 billion £ infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, starting with terminal 5, which has been called the best airport terminal in the world for five years and ending with terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that there will be an enlargement of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of Heathrow's board and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman runs on a highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, the victim slept down on a highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses for an accident when, on Thursday morning, several cars crossed the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morge in the Canton of Vo.
Vo Canton's police report says that she was desperate to commit suicide, and she was on the road in the dark, where several cars drove her.
Undoubtedly, in an attempt to kill yourself, the victims, the 49-year-old Swissman, threw together several cars, including a truck.
She died on the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others have not yet been identified, says the police, who call on the drivers and witnesses of the accident to respond.
Criminal investigations have also been opened in the case, which in such a case is a logical step, the publication Le Tribune de Geneve was announced by lawyer Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds: "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian was on a highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of killing by carelessness when, in August 2014, she drove a man who slept in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Pajärne.
The court found out that the 22 - year - old victim had been drinking and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman, who was on her way to the place of the accident, traveled in a way appropriate to the circumstances, and the judge admitted that the lying man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and exceptional case."
Anyone who has information about a Thursday accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Collects signatures on the Internet to organise a competition for a new Head of the State Revenue Service.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" has launched a collection of signatures to organise a new competition for the Head of State Revenue Service (SRS).
The petition addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens and Farmers' Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a process of nomination of transparent and professional officials.
Petition was created on August 10 and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nomination of Inga Kolegova as Director-General of the SRS is opaque and non-professional.
It reminds us of the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and, once again, disappoints society in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated," says the petition text.
Its author Jānis B. has indicated that the public is not aware of the criteria, as Koļegova has chosen for the post.
Nor is it clear what the candidate's plans for work in the SRS are.
The petition indicates that the State Chancellery should create a new open competition, which actively addresses professional candidates, attracts personnel selection specialists and offers appropriate remuneration.
The Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, formally nominated Kolegov as Head of the SRS last week, was to be approved by the government for a new post this week, but all the Ministers of the Party "Unity" voted against, so the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, I didn't play well.
The beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš have hoped for the award in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, there is no difference in which place to conclude the competition, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's strongest pairs of beach volleyball on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the sub-group tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost Brazilians Evander Gonzalien Oliveira and Pedro Solbergs Salgada, concluding their participation in the four-year most important sports forum.
In three sub-group games Latvian athletes won one win, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The ratio of the small points between the three pairs, which after the convincing loss suffered by this match was the most unfavourable for the Latvian duet.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we also stayed to 16 points," Smedin remembered the game.
I don't even know how we stayed with no points in the rest of the set.
You can't play like that.
Then the second set was fine and managed to break the game at the end of the set, and it had to be a good foundation for the third set.
We started like that, but after we exchanged the parties, the result was only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the sub-group all the teams were similar, in almost all of the match there were three setts, so the small points were important.
"It was necessary to play on a more equal footing than to give up 3-4 points in a row several times," said the athlete.
We knew Evander could be preserved.
"In the first set, we dealt with it, in the second we took 1-2 points, and in the third one +4 he left the game," Smēdiņš remembered.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it happened, at times it didn't.
I did not look at the overall situation before the match, but it was known that we needed as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, I didn't play well," Samoilov said.
We were expecting a good serve from Evandra, and it was also pretty good at the end of the first set, but in the third, the serve opened up to him and it was difficult to make an attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistakes at the Pedra's service, but it had to be dealt with.
Samoilov told me that unlike the previous match, athletes weren't nervous today.
"We went, played, also protected, but needed better reception of the serve," said the athlete.
"They played well and in the end already came to the "urra."
Before the tournament we immediately said that the lottery was the most uncomfortable thing that could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"All of us were expecting a medal, and we ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th place or 4th place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilov had already in Rio de Janeiro the third Olympic career, because in 2008 in Beijing he competed with Mārtiņš Pļaviņš, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
Meanwhile, this was the second start for Schmidt in the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market, both from the position of the consumer and a potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision whether or not Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by the type of gas market model and regulatory framework to be established."
"Therefore, for our part, we are actively involved in drafting and commenting on regulatory enactments, as well as we submit our proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency BNS already wrote that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed the Cabinet of Ministers Regulations project "Regulations for Trade in Natural Gas" that will change the existing principles of operation of natural gas market by ensuring the right to freely choose natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the process of trading natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
The most efficient and user-friendly service solution has therefore been chosen as the "market centre model', where all activities related to customer service are provided by a trader - one contract, one invoice and one information and customer service point, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the discretion of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented for electricity trading.
We remind that the gradual opening of the market for household users is planned - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader', informed the Ministry.
On the other hand, economic operators will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom a natural gas trading agreement is to be concluded.
Pending the conclusion of a contract for the sale of natural gas, the existing natural gas trader will ensure the sale of natural gas for a certain period of time at a specified price.
The Cabinet of Ministers Regulations project specifies in detail the rights and obligations of natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules define the procedure for the delivery of natural gas to users and the interruption of its supply, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified facility for the supply and use of natural gas; the procedure for the settlement of the services received, the amount of interest for delay, the exchange of traders and the supply of customers in the event of disruption of natural gas supply; the procedure for the delivery of natural gas to related users by the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to discuss the increase of remuneration of the Director General of the SRS.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Zaļā un Zemnieku union (ZZS)) next week plans to talk with Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (ZZS) and government coalition partners about the increase of the remuneration of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
Once again-Ozola told journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing remuneration of the Director General of the SRS has to be addressed urgently in order to make this post more attractive to potential retenderers.
Also, next week, there will be talk of changing the terms of the competition.
The Minister also stressed that she had no idea of a specific candidate to be invited to the vacant post.
At the same time, Aizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that Inga Kolegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, would have been a good Director General of the SRS.
In his turn, with regard to the current executive director of the SRS, Dace Peleko, who expressed his willingness to apply for this position, the Minister reiterated his view that the new Director-General of the SRS should have a "view from the outside" and should not come from the structure of the SRS.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from the vacation in order to advance as soon as possible the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS.
The agency BNS already reported that the Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Kolegov, Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), submitted an application to withdraw his candidacy to the post of Director General of the SRS.
In her submission, she stated that this was not an easy choice, but her relatives had been under serious emotional pressure in the last two weeks, although they had not done any law-defence acts.
Kolegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
Ināra Pētersone, the former Director General of the SRS, also reportedly left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchange indices in the US and Europe, as well as the value of the US dollar, are increasing.
Global oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors' sentiment being positively influenced by the statements of the Saudi Minister for Oil, which reinforces the expectation that the major oil-producing countries will take action to stabilise the world oil market at the OPEC meeting in September.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached record levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of a number of large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday also contributed to the rise in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar increased on Thursday in relation to the euro, in relation to the British pound and in relation to the Japanese yen.
In New York's e-commerce, the price of WTI brand crude oil for deliveries in September rose by USD 1.78 to USD 43.49 per barrel on Thursday.
The price of Brent brand crude oil for deliveries on the London Stock Exchange in October increased by 1.99 dollars, to 46.04 dollars per barrel.
Last year the turnover of "Blue Lagoon" is decreasing by 33,8%.
The turnover of the Zila Lagoon, a producer of conservatories last year, was 4.202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than the previous year, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company was working on losses incurred for several reasons, including a persistent lack of working capital caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, ending the credit line previously in force, and leaving "Zilo lagoon" with concluded contracts without being able to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase the cheaper raw material in large quantities and to obtain a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing the European Union Structural Funds support projects, which would have allowed the factory to purchase new production equipment and upgrade the infrastructure.
The financial performance of the company was also negatively affected last year by the increase in raw material prices and the reluctance of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged price changes and were ready to buy goods for the new - the highest - prices," the company's management points out.
In 2015, "Blue Lagoon" also started negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and real estate.
Investors have already been with the company's largest creditor Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the operation and development of the company was positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of the technological processes, which makes it possible to achieve greater productivity and capacity in production.
"The company's management pointed out that several equipment were purchased, ensuring higher production speed."
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's manufacturing site to execute orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the letters of intent on the sale of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold in accordance with the letters of intent.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month," points out the company's management.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on fish products deliveries to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, "Blue Lagoon" has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA in September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Blue Lagoon" worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and a loss of 5.113 million euros.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a core capital of EUR 1.156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89,11) and Igor Širšon (10,89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 to the museum to welcome the film diva Sara Leandere and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be seen as the city of the beginning and inspiration of Sara Leander's career.
Sarah Leender's visit to the godmother Ruth, who was the Swedish Ambassador to Latvia, turned out to be fatal in Riga in 1924 because she discovered the unusual low counteralt of Sarah Leandere's woman, which she tried to debut on the Riga cabaret stage.
Perhaps it was the random fun in Riga that became the fateful turning point in Sara's creative journey towards the world's fame.
Riga was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga on a guest show, but unfortunately these expectations were not destined to come true as World War II started.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and the great Ieva Kerevica will feel in the role of the outstanding Sara Leandere.

Because of the neighboring repair, a man is forced to leave his home at a broken ceiling.
During the LTV broadcast "4th Studija" Dmitrijs Saidjaševs, the neighbor of which started the overhaul of his apartment, and Dmitrijs has been taking care of the plaster from the ceiling since then and is not sure that to stay in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has a damaged ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the house manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any experts.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there," says Dmitrijs.
The invited expert has arrived, recorded the event and admitted that the division was in unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry's first application to the construction board, and until the beginning of this week no one was able to answer if the location in the apartment is life-threatening.
In the Construction Board said that this is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager again to the construction board, and then there is a dead end," says Dmitry.
After examining the entire pile of paper, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, even though you can hear from time to time that someone is working there.
Within a further two months, it was necessary to carry out an examination and within six months for the owner of the apartment, who is carrying out repairs, all those defects had to be rectified.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it to be incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal structure in this supporting structure is affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"This is why we have requested additional explanation from this expert," says Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still clear from there that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without building permits is between 70 and 700 euros, but in this particular case the penalty may be much more severe.
While the expert's opinion is expected, the Construction Board has decided that the two apartments may not be operated - both in which construction works are carried out and Dmitri's apartment.
"This is not the case in the practice of the Construction Board, where because of their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the residents may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the Construction Board.
Now Dmitri has to look for another place to live in - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitri may try to recover the damage from his neighbor in a civil way, which may take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction of both apartments, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his conclusion and may have to wait up to three weeks.
The damage incurred will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened with imprisonment for a period of up to six months because the words of the Construction Board have not been taken into account.
Guess what!

The Russian hacker has been e-mailed by the former NATO Commander, Mr. Warrlow.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. National Committee for Democracy (DNC) may have launched several other cyber attacks, including the e-mails of the NATO European Force former Commander Philippe Wartlow and the George Soros Institute "Open Society" servers, announced the business news agency "Bloomberg" on Thursday.
The information obtained by Hackers has been published on the DDCLeaks.com website.
Among other things, there are correspondence by Mr. Warlow and information on the work of the Soros Institute.
Hackers have had access to the Institute's computers for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with the Russian specs who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is currently addressing the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the intrusion of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have an official cyber attack on the servers of the Democratic Party to sue Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published in July about 20 000 e-mails obtained from the DNC's computer system, from which it is understood that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the campaign of the former rival Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders of the party, Hilary Clinton, in the fight for democratic nomination in the presidential election.
According to the US press, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts investigations into the intrusion of democrat servers, as well as other US special services, considers that Russia's connection to cyber-attacks is almost indisputable.
McCartney: The Beatles threatened Yoko Ono's presence.
Paul McCartney admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary group "The Beatles."
The 74-year-old rock star is currently maintaining a "good" relationship with the widow of late John Lennon, but at the time she went to attend the recording studio, she scared McCartney because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lennon and McCartney.
When asked about the relationship between the two, he replied to the "Rolling Stone" magazine: "It's really good."
We felt threatened at that time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group couldn't tolerate it.
We were able to do this, but not very successful, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexy, but the girls usually didn't come to the record studio, they let us run.
When John began to meet Yoko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The artist of "Yello Submarine" has also admitted that he is in regular contact with the former group member Ringo, and from time to time confirms the work plans of "Apple," but otherwise "The Beatles" has "completed to work."
When asked if he still meets the other one still living in the legendary rock band, McCartney said to the "Rolling Stone" magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to the meetings, I feel a little isolated.
I left Apple during a heavy divorce.
I sent John Eastman to the meetings in my place and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company is now working so that I'm just listening to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus once inhabitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a inhabitable planet.
Scientists at the NASA Godard Institute for Space Research have developed a model to explore Venus' history, using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and the atmosphere of which consists almost exclusively of carbon, once had earthlike conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rate of rotation can be explained by the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus once had a plan, a similar atmosphere to the Earth, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus' earlier topography.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity on the planet to create life and prevent the evaporation of water.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the GIS model simulation Venus spin model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explained GIS scientist Antony Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the planet's surface and causes rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as an umbrella to protect the planet from the sun's heat.
This results in a moderate climate temperature that is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today.
The model represents Venus's history, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once inhabitable, over several billion years Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans evaporated, and the spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As the water fully evaporated, only the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today - left behind.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned from the position of coach for Avalanche
On Thursday, Patrick Roy, coach and vice-president of the Hockey operations of Colorado "Avalanche," submitted a resignation, which was due to the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
In Colorado, vice president and general manager Joe Sakik confirmed this message and informed that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetically, enthusiastically and purposefully fulfilling my duties as the chief coach and Vice President of the Colorado Club's hockey operations," says 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
During this summer, I have thought a lot about how I could improve the team's performance in order to give it the brilliance it needs and achieve higher-level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the chief coach and vice-president of hockey operations must be in full harmony with the visions of the organisation.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Jake said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with "Avalanche" team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's best coach and received Jack Adams' award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the games, Colorado won the Minnesota hockeyist. Since then, the club has not been in the game for two years.
"Avalanche" ended the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the "Wild" team without obtaining the second special invitation from the organisers of the Western Conference.
The wardman Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with the Montreal Canadiena and two with the Avalanche.

The workers' strikes on the North Sea oil platform have been postponed because the two parties to the dispute have resumed the negotiations, and the negotiators have told them.
Periodically, strikes are organized against the oil processing company "Wood Group" on the North Sea oil platforms in which the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of the Wood Group and of the Unite and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
In the coming weeks, a series of full-day meetings are scheduled to start at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examining the issues at stake.
The trade unions announced that their recent events, organised after a break of more than 25 years, were directed against the planned 30 per cent reduction in wages.
This year, due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
On the other hand, several thousands of people had already reduced their salaries and announced plans to cease oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise their work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company, the BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the UK's decision to leave the European Union further complicates the situation.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individual individuals.
In 2016, nearly 1.4 billion dollars are expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to 7 billion dollars invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of stars in the column constellation.
The latest mission of Kepler's telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of the speed of the stars in the Plejade constellation.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the speed of the stars refers to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information on the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of its solar system," said Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center scientist Luisa Rebula.
The Plejade constellation is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation only begin to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They turn at maximum speed.
As they turn at maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of star winds.
When the winds get into the magnetic field of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As stars age, their speed decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star by determining the time between the appearance of recognizable star areas, such as sun spots.
The latest star speed catalogue shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars to dancers, larger dancers perform piruets slower than small dancers.
Rebul tells that in the "ballet" of Plejade it can be seen that slowly rotating objects are larger and more solid, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Plejade constellation is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where you can compare star characteristics to spin speeds.
Rebuls tells us that the Plejade constellation helps to create theoretical models for star rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of the stars slows down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented a detailed analysis of the rotation speed of Plejade stars in three new publications, which will shortly be published in the Astronomy Journal.
