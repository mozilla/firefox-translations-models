28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who would like to hurt his brother, stating that: "His life finally began to improve."
The corpse, found near Westfield supermarket on Wednesday, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the San Francisco for Forensic Medical Expertise Bureau said.
San Francisco police said his death had been declared murder and is currently under investigation.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia tells San Francisco's broadcaster ABC KGO that Frank previously worked as a cook in Boston, but six months ago he got his dream job at the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a cohesive family and we will miss him very much," the spokesman said.
At this difficult time we are thinking with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that at first Frank had stayed overnight in hostels, but recently life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells the radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia claims that he doesn't know who would like to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by preparing a tasty meal and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in quarrels.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
"Given everything that had gone wrong in the world, he was like a raw diamond that shone brightly every day," he says.
Anyone with information about what happened is invited to call the IFPD Information number 415-575-44444.
Young doctors strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of young doctors are demanding their union to launch protests in a dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Physicians Committee (JAK) is preparing to request the Council to support broader protests in early September.
JAK believes ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
58% of all members who voted in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message published on Thursday evening on Twitter, JAK Council member Ellen McCrott said the government continues to remain silent on the issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: "Given this, as a result of the JAK vote, the contract offer has been completely rejected and a decision has been made to demand new formal negotiations to discuss key issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today officially requested a meeting with the AAL Council to authorize the development of new treaties that would take effect in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors took part in six strikes, including the first time in the history of the NHS, having stopped working.
After the vote, which rejected the terms of the contract proposed by the Art Academy of Latvia, which was recommended by BMA, resigned from the position by the representative of the new doctors of the Art Academy of Sciences Dr. Johan Malawana.
Before meeting 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the health secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that the contract would be concluded with English medics.
Russia and Turkey: Excruciate Alliance?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of the eight-month-long word and economic sanctions war.
But Vladimir Putin, greeting the Turkish leader in the St. Petersburg Palace, gave the impression that this partnership is more needed by Ankara.
The two, however, shocked.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked artificial and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual abstinence.
In contrast, recep Tayymp Erdogan called Putin at least five times his "expensive friend," a meeting review said.
I got a despair.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
But the radiant coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the shooting down of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
Back then, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of having stabbed a dagger in Moscow's back.
The abuse was even more painful given that it came from a friend's side.
Restoring true confidence will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television released aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were accusations that Erdogan's own family made a profit from illegal oil trade with Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He denied it himself, of course.
But the main message of the meeting in St. Petersburg that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could perceive it as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from peace reconciliation is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month, in which he was attempted to overthrow.
Also, countless terrorist attacks have shaken his positions.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused profound damage, especially the charter flight ban, which usually provides an influx of millions of Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe a relief when regular flights are resumed.
They are hoping for a vacation fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the country's TV expects to drop the prices of fruit and vegetables, as the imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West about, in their opinion, the weak reaction to the attempted coup.
You can also look at all the frustrations with the long-standing negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin's intervention, who is happy to take advantage of the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly scored additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because itself has a deep-rooted fear of changing the regime in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as an analyst was called, the "leased alliance," two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main discrepancy affects Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, without wishing to disclose information, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish president targeted questions about disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on Syria.
But after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters when NATO member Turkey hit a Russian plane, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The brand SKB will play a support role in the future, the bank's CEO has announced.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross McCadev tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up on these ambitions, because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But it has now been decided to bring to the forefront other national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the headquarters and the official stock exchange list, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already using the brand in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private finance brands such as Cooutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also be in mind.
Makevan was interviewed during a trip with customers and employees on Inverness.
He told the BBC Scottish channel: "SKB will become a brand of our investors and with whom our employees work because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it would not continue sponsoring "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's the right time to become a brand bank because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, and not our own needs, we have obviously made big changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins 3000th win, winning first place in Newmarket with horse Predilection
Detors uncork champagne, winning his 3000th win twice in the first race in Newark.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th win in British history, taking first place in Newmarket.
He achieved it by scoring a second win in those races, which took place in his hometown, riding Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, who has achieved such a result in the horse sprint race.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Leicester Pygot, Peter Ederie and Willy Carson.
Three-time champion of jockey Detori, who won with a horse Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I'm very happy that it happened in Newmarket because I've been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not a Royal Astet, but an ordinary Friday night with 20 000 people.
I feel relaxed and very grateful.
After the win, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have reached this record in race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the career-ending 20-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who set several records in his career, scoring more than 4300 wins.
Leicester Pygot, a nine-time derby winner, has won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys and it's no surprise that he has achieved success that only a few are capable of achieving.
He is stylish and strong, but his sense of tactics distinguish him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic race representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans to this sport.
A few weeks ago in the Epsom race I told Frankie that he had already won 6000 wins if he didn't participate only in weekends and big races.
But seriously, however, it is a real pleasure that Franky has been winning the UK race on a regular basis for 30 years.
He's cheerful, which is great for British races, besides being an outstanding jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his brand name - a flying jump.
From the finish at wind speed to a flying jump, Frenque Detori has been a racing face for two decades.
This has been an adventurous path.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seventh" in Askot, and survived the plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character's strength by challenging those who questioned him when he returned to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for some time - Detori has previously said that he would be happy to continue participating in the race at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses administration leader Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired head of administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the circle of Putin's closest people for many years.
Currently, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "deposits to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration" without mentioning the reason.
Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed to the post of Ivanov.
The 44-year-old Guino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin's website (in Russian), he later headed the Presidential Protocol and the administration of government staff.
After his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as the President of Latvia by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave office and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Do smiles convince?
This move confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked for the Soviet security service in the KGB.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a meeting broadcast on state television, the two men said Ivanov was resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles oriented on cameras, rarely does such an explanation convince, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome associated with the struggle for power?
No one knows that.
But the official statement that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great skepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust this difficult position, one might even say, a problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the KGB State Security Service, like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, Ivanovs held the post of deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov in the number of five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of Russian president, as Putin's re-election for a third term would be unconstitutional.
But at that time, another close ally of Putin became president - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and three and a half years later returned to the office of president.
The advent of mysterious fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banfa asks for help to find out the conditions that fish of a species appeared in his garden in Banf.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sand blush, who have arrived with a water station .
Mr. Bein, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, released a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how these 5 centimeters have gone into his garden.
Quinfeed crossover: The bridge is now connected to Faif.
The €1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensfearian junction and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is coming to an end.
The design of the facade bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tons of steel, 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The €1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economy Secretary Kate Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb onto the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queens-Sea bridge."
In this project, we see an unrivalled engineering solution, where only these parts use more than 30 000 tons of cement and steel in the construction of this part.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, the connection of the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires a huge precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the final section connecting the bridge with Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for installation.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-end engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it with the support of the northern tower, we had to connect the northern section of the road with the ground part or viaduct.
This was done by sliding the part of the north driveway viaduct 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled in a slope of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions, with which the team worked, was just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything worked out well.
Simon Bails wins gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Bails doesn't bother all of this.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortlessly performs exercises on the beam.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Absolutely flawless.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62.198 was the head court superior to the silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raisisman's score and the bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simon Bailsa performed exercise on a log in the individual multi-fight final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American in a row to win the title of Much Champion and the Fifective Gymnast, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the end result was announced, she blured in tears because the long road to the moment was over.
This achievement ranks him next to unbeatable athletes like Michael Phelp, who raised his sport to another level.
Bails has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships, including 10 gold medals, making such outstanding, accurate and ambitious exercise combinations that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lutone called her "the best gymnast she ever saw."
In Brazil, she was greeted by the last test, where she had to compete largely with expectations that put on her, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simon Bails (left) and Alija Raisman are hugging after winning gold and silver medals in the individual grandstand final of the women's 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, respectively.
Bailesa won her first gold medal on Tuesday, making a special selection attendance party for the team coordinator Martha Karoliji.
Although Bails claims that she had not expected anything like this on her way to the peaks of fame, it is not true.
Part of her performance in her free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents, when she was still an infant and was discovered by the mother of coach Amy Bourmann on an excursion to the gym, where the Kurmane terrains took place, has now become the strength to take into account.
She hasn't lost in a multi-fighting competition since the summer of 2013 and the series of victories can continue as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustaffin took a little lead during the two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The balance log and free movement - the part of the competition, where Biles will defend her championship title, is still just ahead.
She went to the bow with a score of 15.433 on the beam and strengthened the lead with a score of 15.933 in free movement
Raisman gently hugged her while she was waiting for results, which was just a formality and she broke into tears of joy when the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook came true.
Raismane's result was like a slight revenge for four years of events, when she shared third place with Mustafin, yet lost the fight for a bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which the Americans call the "grandmother," took the convincing lead.
After her performance in free movement, which dispelled doubts about her return, she could devote to the crowd of air kisses.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bailes's viral Twitter post, which she posted this week, is now of a completely different meaning.
6-year-old Mahay Brown "the breakthrough of the bullets" survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that it is already the second six-year-old to shoot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents CBS Philadelphia news channel confirmed it was Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say Brown was shot several times, including groin, leg, and belly, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendez tells television: "His little body was simply bulleted hole."
I can't believe it.
The boy has been placed in a critical condition in a hospital and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs that he will definitely recover.
He had to start going first in the classroom at local elementary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the city of Djermanta.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the condition of the other two victims is stable.
The channel says the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police were investigating whether any of them was an attacker.
The investigator told the channel CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely to have been involved in the shooting.
At the scene, gun cartridge shells belonging to various weapons were found.
It looks like it's been a long shelling.
The shells were found on both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk.
"Accordingly, it looks like there were several armed shooters who actively participated in the shooting," says the captain of the Philadelphia Police Antony Ginaldi.
Damage also caused to a number of homes and cars.
No one has yet been detained and is reported to have police checks on surveillance camera recordings.
A 6-year-old girl in her hand was hit by a 6-year-old girl while she was playing in front of her house in the Westouclean area on Tuesday.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athletics Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team has three athletes, Simona Bails, Gabby Duglas and Laury Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raisisene, who is a Jew and Madson Kociana, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
The best gymnast for the past four years is African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became an astonishing Olympic champion in an astonishing round, and America was able to rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by the triple world champion Simona Bails, Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the individual for women.
Her teammate Alija Raisman won a silver medal.
We've seen the best thing this sport can give, but in the rest of the country the situation in gymnastics lessons is completely different.
Simona, Gabby and Lauria entered the Olympic team in the same way as Alija and Madison.
They are "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Martha Carol in the work of a coach.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts mainly train in private athletics clubs and are maintained by parents who pay for workouts, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their training sessions, and this is an expensive and long investment for athletics families.
Amy Bourmann - Simona Bailes coach and Megie Hainya - Laurie Hernandez's coach has coached her athletes since both girls started doing athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabby and Lauria, cheaper gymnastics training options.
I founded my own athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 city youth (mainly black and Spanish-based) gymnastics workouts free of charge or at a low price. We have also coached national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (in my hometown) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and aspiration to the goal.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it's fantastic.
Engaging in this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gaby and Madison for the excellent demonstration of the "Heel of Girls", winning the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's offer, young doctors plan to roll out more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the treaty with representatives of the British Medical Association. But it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, stating that NHS is in a state of poor condition and further delays would only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions for work on night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening BMA spokeswoman of new doctors Dr. Elena Makourta stated that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the workforce crisis and it does not impose equal conditions on all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of young doctors sign the new contract, so progress needs to be made, as there is not much time left.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve the problem through negotiations have faced the government's reluctance to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This has happened despite the fact that still last month Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop inactivity and cooperate with young doctors.
If he doesn't do that, then young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone on picket.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching an agreement on changes to the treaty with representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate for work on weekends for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to new contracts.
NHS employment chief executive Daniel Mortimer called on young doctors not to go on strikes.
Mr Mortimera explains that the strikes do not solve anything, but only raises pressure on the staff loaded and worries, creates stress and hindrance to patients, caregivers and their families.
For the last two months, we have spoken to the new Committee for Physicians and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions we have answered positively their questions about trustees and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of employees, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, study abandonment and gender pay inequality in medicine - show that employers, England's health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are seriously seeking to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
The drug for 2 pounds per day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with 2 pounds per day, as official representatives recommend more and more people.
The anti-cloking drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use for 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of repeated cardiac arrest.
NHS-represented NICE recommends the use of this preparation for 4 years after heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE currently under the control of the NHS recommends the use of this preparation for 4 years after the heart attack to further reduce the risk of the heart and blood vessels.
Approximately 140 000 people in England experience a heart attack each year, and a quarter of whom experience a repeated heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the blockage ruptures, it can cause a clot, blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the clot separates from the vascular wall, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by British firm AstraZeneca and traded under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots.
The new NICE guidelines, which was published today, are recommended for humans for 90 mg for 12 months and for another 3 years of 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, director of NICE health technology, explains: "Despite the availability of medications to prevent repeated heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attacks can have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that Ticaglor, combined with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of repeated heart attack and heart attack in people who have already experienced it.
Preliminary recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can expand the treatment options for thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagror, particularly the risk of bleeding with this medicinal product for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use longer than this period.
Political Correctness culture promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to a management report, former Mayor of the Town of Tauerhamlet Lutfur Rahman was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government's report reveals that political correctness cultures are turning a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister, Sir Eric Pick, criticizes police, election supervisors and city councils that they ignore signs of fraud in the electoral process because "afraid to offend ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so common that police should be allowed to place guards near polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should present an identity document when they are voting to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only have to provide a name and address.
He even recommends tagging voters' fingers with special ink to prevent double voting.
The whistleblowers should also provide more protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have more access to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local authority from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Downing Street after the scandal in connection with the city elections in Tauerhamlet.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove the city mayor Lutfur Rahman from the post of mayor of the city due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rachman "crinkly misrepresented" the religious views of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rachman has led his election campaign with a stance that the religious duty of believers' Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were fake or dubious because one person had voted multiple times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that particularly worrying was the fraud in voting by mail, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document to find out the identity of the person.
His report said: "The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for candidates chosen by the community senior, especially in the Bangladesh and Pakistani communities."
"There are fears that the county authorities do not pay attention to these problems due to political correctness, as they could offend ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists operating with votes cast by mail to prevent "voice collection."
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough check-in to prevent voter lists of use for immigration and benefits fraud.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to present an identity document before voting.
Mark the fingers of voters with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the nationality of individuals to make sure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Ban political campaigners and activists work with votes cast by mail and ballot papers to vote by mail.
Provide police with the power to assign security guards to polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of individuals under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit taking photos at polling stations.
Determine the requirement to use only English at polling stations (except in Wales).
Reinforces training so that polling staff ensures voters go to the ballot boxes one by one.
Sir Eric sharply criticizes the Metropolitan police, expressing incomprehension that there were no charges in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The electoral court only disqualified Lufu Rahman and his representative for acts of corruption and fraud."
He was overwhelmed as guilty of a standard of criminal law evidence based on conclusive evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "tick test" of voters of the city council in the electorate registration stations.
Sir Eric points out: "The court decision made last year is an alarm bell.
Our land is known as the homeland of the parliament, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the authorities' pretending that fraud is not a threat to this good reputation.
Excitement to cyclist - Kate's counterpart and other Rio Olympic celebrity counterparts
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics will get excited about French cyclist Paulin Ferrand Prevot, who have been found by fans as extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old cyclist isn't the only athlete who is fighting for gold this summer, who, as the media writes, is proud of her celebrity counterpart.
Therefore, in honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently seen on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of participants of the Olympic Games, which is quite similar to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. archer teammate Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood
Apart from Kate's counterpart on the cycling track, many people on the internet say this bowstazer could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo Di Caprio.
Brady Ellisson, a member of the U.S. men's archery, caused a storm on Twitter when photos were posted where he was very similar to Wall Street Wolf.
The athlete himself also noticed a storm on social media and admitted that he was compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see a big resemblance except a beard," Brady tells the publication Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I perceive it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular pairs of 2012 London Olympics counterparts will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the stunning similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutterford and popular actor Nile Patrick Harris.
Russian Athletics Alija Mustafina, thanks to her big, expressive eyes, is compared to the cuban-born American singer Gloria Estefan.
Speaking of swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has been compared to "Created for Stage" star Matthew Morrison for several years.

Theory: this user believes that there may be a reason why both look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user said with real pleasure that "the rest of the internet users agreed that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."

Other popular comparisons include Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney. Likewise, the gold medalist, the athlete Gabby Douglas, is proud of a beautiful, wide smile that resembles the smile of "Bring It On" star Gabriela Unijonas.
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer allegedly 'come as a pig'.
A analysis by A barron McDonald's for the fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women, evoked an indignant storm in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "franked out of the race that he smelled alone" and "comed like a pig."
Commentator Af. Mindead thought his microphone was off when 4x200 m freestyle relays for women at the end of the final set out his personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commenter team to give comments liveliness, said, "Its little fourteen-year-old from China is unable to keep up."
"Too run, she flew out of the race, that she smelled alone and died like a pig."
Thank you very much!
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana's score in the second stage was 1:57.79, that's 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylore Rucka's score, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers throughout Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked by hearing such a tone and expressions.
Emet McPharlain posted on Twitter: "Are the CBC commentator just told me that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "deaded like a pig"???????.
The idiot did not understand that they were still in direct air.
Ai Yanha from China's 4x200m freestyle final for women was named "a little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism against Basron McDonald's quickly took effect as many demanded clarifications.
Twitter users couldn't believe in hearing the insensitive comments by Abyron McDonald's.
Twitter user Sara Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and for the sake of you we all sound like racists. #disgusting.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who was running a CBC live at the time, apologised for McDonald's comments, saying, "We apologize for commentary on the result of swimming sounded in the live broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded to Twitter to that comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
The CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users complaining about McDonald's comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and they came into direct ether.
Yesterday we immediately reacted and apologized to all live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that the comments of Byron were expressed about the performance of the swimmer, and not addressed to her personally.
But they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Af. Binoron greatly regrets what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald's personally apologized to the live broadcast and tried to explain that he didn't think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
He said in a live broadcast of the CBC Olympics: "I would like to use the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after women's freestyle competitions."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I wasn't meant to show disrespect and I'm really sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who brazenly tried in the middle of a lingerie store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to undress to try panties in the middle of the store.
By further aggravating the situation, she tried them to make sure they suit her and then took off, putting the panties back on the store shelf.
She continued to search for clothes at the Folkeston Bouverie Place shopping centre store and tried on four more panties.
Primark shop Bouverie Place in the shopping center in Folkeston – the place where this woman tried on underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At that time, the shop also housed the mother of two Janija Davidson, who tells that the unfamiliar woman was putting on her clothes after applying the underwear and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people were unable to believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took underpants from the shelf, took her put off their tights and trousers and surveyed them on the spot.
She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just tried them right there on the spot.
Everyone watched her trousers and apparently the woman didn't like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided that she did not like any of them and left the store.
It didn't look like her to be worried that someone was watching or thinking about a person who would buy the clothes she tried on.
Mrs Davidson (33 years) from Kent says: "Derdza's thought that someone will buy clothes that have been tried on by another person and which have not been washed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson adds: "I assume that the employees of the store removed those clothes from the store's shelves after her departure - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine being able to buy new underwear and find out that another woman has tried them on and then they haven't been washed.
Primark's spokesman said Primark was aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9.
The particular clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself in the close distance from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Mag's grandmaster from New York Rone Mizraki.
Whether you're attacking from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and gain the top of the attacker.
The bustle points out that if the attacker attacks from behind, then you first have to turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid the trajectory of the gun.
Then the weapon should be gripped between your front arm and shoulder and make a beating on the opponent's face with his free elbow.
Then follows a blow with a knee in the groin and while the attacker is freezing in the hurt, he must take the gun, hit him in the face with a trunk and lean back, continuing to turn the gun against him.
If the attacker approaches the front, the situation is similar - avoid the trajectory of the shot, grip the weapon and lay it out so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, pressure on the gun must be put and a kick on the opponent should be made on the chest and finally take away the gun and retreat to continue to aim at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Misracaki does.
But remember, if you are not a master of Krav Maga, then it is safer to give your money to the robber.
The Vandal family vandals the social house of Saltaša Kornvola and is evicted on the street.
The Vandals family has been evicted from the residence for the terrorisation of neighbors, causing damage to the social house at 50 000 pounds.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilok were only posted from the property in Saltašás Kornvolais because several complaints have been filed for them.
When they were forcibly evicted from the property, the shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property had been fully vandalised.
There were holes in the floors and walls, there were wastes everywhere and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now evicted from the property and most likely lives in a private property.
Donna McCauja, the manager of the House Service of Cornwall, says there are concerns that it will not be possible to rebuild the dwelling.
She tells that it was extremely difficult for the people who lived here and she believes that people can't live like that.
In this case, a number of factors should be assessed, since in the future this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically stayed in the property and police say their terror manifested themselves as violence, barking on the street with baseball battens, bullying from locals, drug abuse, drug sales and loud shouts and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, whose name was the property, was sentenced in June for anti-social behaviour.
Several rooms of the demolish house found discarded waste.
In a house where drugs are previously marketed, several floorboards have also been pulled out.
Neighbors say they regularly got on the street and were constantly called police.
Cornwall Housing Service put them out of property forcibly when they had been given 11 weeks to move out of the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbours were very happy about eviction, because their lives were absolute hell.
One said, "They weren't caring for other residents ."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
Unbelievable how often we have seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrik, who is the head of the Kornvol nakalu service's neighbourhood protection, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police have been regularly called here.
Various old and unusable items were found in the overgrown garden of the house.
He also said: "It is very unfortunate that tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because eviction from the house is always the final step to be considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and the neighbours had been very hard to watch their behaviour.
I appreciate the work invested in this case by all my team, the Devonian and Cornwall police and members of the community, who were brave and cooperated with us by providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make the lives of neighbors easier and show that antisocial behavior is not acceptable.
Physzpatrik said that all three sons lived here in different periods of time, but all of them were about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after eviction.
Service staff will now have to clean the pile of garbage left in the house.
In 2014, the police house carried out a search and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of the storage of Class B-drug drugs for its use.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After eviction, it became known that they are currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
On many walls of the house were drawn graffiti.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their rental agreements.
Angela Crova, a spokeswoman for Devon and Cornwall, says this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
She also said that: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they wish and will have no consequences."
Criminal and antisocial behaviour are not acceptable to the Devonian and Kronvola police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Readiness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

Cannes mayor banned burkini swimsuits on beaches.
The Mayor of the French southern resort Cannes has banned the wearing of burkini swimsuits on the beaches of this city, which almost completely obscures the woman's body and very reminiscent of a wetsuit, local officials said Thursday.
Cannager Mayor David Liner has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as the fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"A beach suit that outwardly shows religious affiliation at a time when France and cult sites are the target of terrorist attacks can pose a risk of disturbances of public order (tightening, collisions, etc.) that needs to be prevented," the order said.
"We are talking not about the ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outrageous clothing that is associated with trust in terrorist movements that are at war with us," explained the municipal utilities manager, Jeri Migul.
He added that burkini swimsuits on Canna Beaches have not been seen since July 28, when Linard, a member of the right-wing centrist party, "Republicans," signed this order and it came into effect.
Earlier this week, the water park in the city of Marseille canceled a planned private event for Muslim women who would be dressed in burkini swimsuits, as the indignation of such an event was expressed by politicians of both right-wing and left-wing circles.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face-covering headgear of Muslim women, but religious symbols or relevant clothing are not prohibited.
On July 14, 85 people were killed in the resort city of Nice, near the Cannes, for which the Islamic State was held responsibility.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State brutally murdered a priest in a church in the north-west of France.

Also this year, like other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.

The festival "Kubāna" has begun in Lucavsala.
On the evening of Thursday, August 11, one of the last festivals of this summer was given to one of the last festivals of this summer in Lucavsala - there until Sunday night will take place "Pubāna".
The first evening was pampered by groups such as "Enter Shikari" from Britain, which was expected last year, but disappeared from the program unnoticed, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival, the program contains noteworthy words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the drummer of the punk legend "Ramones" Marcy Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergei Mikhaloku at the forefront, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vy.another but full programme of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year, it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it did not stop the organizers from repeated attempts - they added a long-size to the title, included in the program also a Latvian group (on Friday evening at 19:15 will take to the stage "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "closer and acquired the local colours alongside the symbols of Riga like its panāma and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, it is too early to judge, because the festival has only run into, but, as "Delfi Entertainment" observed on the first evening, at least for the time being, huge crowds of people have not been able to attract huge crowds and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
Britain's track cycling team twice corrects the Olympic record and wins the sprint.

President who remained in the shadows: Gustavs Zemgals - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals was born.
Zemgals proclaimed the Latvian state, but the newly described first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last president of the pre-war period Kārlis Ulmanis have remained undeservedly.
No one of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgals, writes Arnolds Auzins in a book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgals, published ten years ago.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi", Auzins emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
Others such stiffs, always very right.
He was able not to be, nowadays it could be similar to what Raimonds Vējonis is like.
"He was one who is close to the people," says Auzins.
Modern politicians know history badly, they referred to Kārlis Ulmanis as a good leader, but rarely anyone knows how furious he was.
At the government meetings, the only person he was not shouting to, was General Balodis.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"Secgals with his sense of humour and democracy leaves exactly the opposite impression," says Auzins.
Aivars Stranga, a professor at the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with "Delfi", agrees with Auziņa’s assessment of Zemgale as a calm and balanced stateman.
He also notes that Zemgals has been distinguished by respect for minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not a common course, after Zemgals' presidency Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and balanced man who had to persuade to become president for a long time.
He didn't strive for it, just didn't scheak of fame.
He also quite critically evaluated himself, because he did not know the French language, but believed that the president should definitely be able to do so.
"During the Presidency, the basics of the French language learned," Stranga explains.
Zemgals did not allow himself to be persuaded to stand again, he didn’t really like the high positions.
In all respects, he is a very respectable personality in the history of Latvia, already before getting to the presidential palace he was in serious position - he was a very demanded notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgala cashiers at 3 Suvovorova Street, where the association of sailors and publishers was located, in which the Latvian state was practically in government negotiations.
He was always progressively tuned.
It wasn't a big fan of Ulmanis, but he didn't really object to him either.
"In private conversations, however, has sometimes said that Ulmanis’ actions do not really sympathize with him," Stranga points out.
Having lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How is Zemgale remembered today?
It's a pity, but for a lot he associates with just a street in Riga.
He was an absolute Democrat, the views were centrist.
"No big shocks were held during his time, namely, he could associate with such a truly stable presidency," Stranga sums up.
During the presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, the State visit of Latvia to Sweden took place, which at the time indirectly implied full recognition in the neighbouring country and its integration into the family of Northern European democracies.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals arrived for a state visit to Stockholm.
The reply visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with attacks of anger.
I often have to deal with the fact that the appearance of anger, rage of the child, the appearance of rage, is considered something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Ekaterina Kess.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger, which everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - usually we know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other loved ones, we can get a sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispense an anger!), enter the shower, hit a bribe around the table and do other things that we do not usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others because we know different other ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are suffering from anger, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", You're a fool," "Bad Mom," "I don't hate" - and very rarely when you're able to say, "I'm angry at you."
Children live in a literal sense, they are fully located right here, at this point, they are spontaneous and truly in the performance of their feelings, and are often also in the captivity of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not deny the child feelings, including anger, not to be ashamed of it and do not calm down, but on the contrary - help the child.
Do you need to pause in a relationship?
A long working day, in which everything has not quite gone as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "disconnect" from all over the world for a while, a day, or even longer.
Is it possible to pause relationships for a moment and breathe a little?
Does this also show that each of the partners has its own way to go?
Gentlemen share their opinions at different ages.
John (23) is short and concise: "In my opinion, if you need a pause in a relationship, then you are not with the right person."
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may be able to help someone.
If you feel that your partner starts to fall on your nerves for every little detail, then definitely - it's the right moment to look at other hunting fields to understand whether you miss him, or not especially think about him or even you don't want to see her anymore.
So the answer is yes, withholding a pause can help save time and understand how important the other half is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, a pause should be kept in a relationship from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to bother each other, especially if there is nothing else to talk about, but what you have done in the day.
My personal experience makes you think so, so I haven't endured a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think at least for a moment that it is better elsewhere or near another - then why does this woman, whom you are with, deserve someone who can think about being not good enough here and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a little betrayal.
If not, then there is no.
"I have, so I'm a little condemning those who don't have." says Edmund (46).
Karlis (33) has almost the opposite view.
I think everyone needs a moment for respite.
You can't look at each other every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, look each other's eyes and rejoice at the endless love.
Get Back!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, also for a girlfriend or wife, however, if both know how to hold that balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the grave.
That and only so.
Martin (27) says: "It is hard to say - it is necessary or not necessary, may or may not take a pause, but one thing is certain - its initiator does not have something in the relationship to the end, something is missing."
If this question is heard, then it should be taken into account that in the near future there will be some changes - for the better or for the worse, it depends on themselves.
I think, while you are still young and crazy, you need to pause - even all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there can be no question about rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't stand the society of each other and you need a respite from time to time, then what will happen when you have pensioners who comment on how the persuasing cats mess or argues about which day the garden needs to be better ravawed," explains Kristaps (19).
All the words of the gentlemen have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozentāls first awakened the interest of Latvian people in the Latvian nation to imaginative arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian nation, which, as such, will remain unforgettable forever," Romans Suta once wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Janis Rozentāls.
Also in 2016, when opening the old master’s extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on August 12, but already from August 13 it is open to visitors and will be open until October 30.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours the painter Jans Rozentāls (1866-1916) with a broad retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall, whose centenary birthday is on the international stage in the UNESCO Celebration Days.
The retrospective exhibition, featuring more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the anniversary programme of Janis Rozentāls.
The selection of artworks is mostly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic creative activity, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallen-Kalle Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Liepāja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the convocations of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter with his own camera for the creative needs of creativity.
In turn, the Finnish-Latvian Commonwealth Society "Rozentāls-seura", named after a Latvian classic, simultaneously offers a small informative traveling exhibition "With a glance in Finland, with a heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki in the autumn.
Matt Leblank is looking forward to returning to the show "TopGear."
Matt Leblank, head of the television broadcast "TopGear" ("Gas in the Floor!"), said that he is looking forward to returning the second season of the automobile show, but admitted that he does not know what awaits him in the future.
Nothing officially is happening yet.
"If there is, then the BBC will announce it," Leblanks revealed in a conversation with television critics.
The future of "Gas in the Floor!" arose in July, when Leblanque's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanque and "Gas in the floor!" are "as created for each other."
Evans describes the former star of the series "Friends" ("Friends") as a "real and good man", thus dispelling rumors that the friendship between the two was confused during filming.
When Leblank asked what he liked the most on the show, he replied that traveling to other countries like South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC says the show does not yet plan to replace Evansu in the new 24 season.

The behind-the-scenes of the U.S. model business in his interpretation has acquired a perverted glanche of exquisite photo sessions and the intolerance of a horror film.
Basically - a very provocative, balanced work on sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to remove the borderlines between the European art house film and the territory of the Hollywood genre of the film and the Hollywood genre.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in the lead role highlights the question of whether the conceptually chosen life models of parents (ecologicalism, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from the gluten society and values) brings blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The father of six children idealist after the death of his wife is confronted with questions about the correctness of choices and the real values.
A touching, life-smart film, the author of which Matt Ross has won the Cannes Festival Award for the director..
Of course, the sharks do it as attacking beautiful girls - in the Jocci it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, played by Blake Livley.
The work required her profound heroism.
This survival solo programme can be compared to the demonstration of James Franco's acting in the film for 127 hours and the play of Ryan Reynolds in the film Described alive.
Perhaps the main role-player Mila Kunis is also to blame, whose transformation from a sample mother into a creative survivor and a surf of almost family values seems to be created by fantasies of rather desperate Hollywood scriptwriters.
Islamic State captured 2000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State militants of the terrorist group, fleeing Menbiza, in Syria's Alepo province, seized some of the 2000 civilian populations used as a living shield, the U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab alliance and observers said on Friday.
"We did not shoot at them because they, fleeing to Jarabulus, took civilians with them," a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbiza military council said in a statement.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, said on Friday that Menbiza has been liberated from jihadists.
The Islamic State captured Menbiz in 2014.
QSD already last week expelled most of the "Islamic State" fighters from Menbiza, but part held on and showed fierce resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking themselves along with the captives.
Islamists go to Jarabulus, which is located near the Turkish border.
The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State has kidnapped about 2000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists hijacked the cars of the city's residents, forced people to climb them, and then took them to Jarabulus.
Islamic State militants have also previously carried out massive human abductions.
In January, Islamists, conquering territories in Deir ez Zor in eastern Syria, kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
Later, the Islamists released about 270 of the captives.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled from Menbiza is unknown.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbiza military council reported that the QSD managed to rescue 2500 people who were taken captive by Islamists in Menbiza.
According to SOHR, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the Battle of Menbiži.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kolegova refuses to stand for the position of the head of the SRS.
The Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Kolegova has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the position of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), LETA was informed by the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova points out that discussing her candidacy has heightened the contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
The real reasons for the discussions seem to be related to the visible, but more often, invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with my professional skills.
"This is also unacceptable to me", emphasizes now the candidate for the position of the head of the SRS.
In the event that her candidacy were approved by the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow the necessary changes to be fully worked and implemented by the SRS, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, full-fledged work would not be possible, concludes Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly stressed publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment all my candidacy process is overly politicized," explains the official.
"Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, it is an experience that I value as a benefit," Kolegova writes in the application to Reizniece-Ozola.
Unity said on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegova, "essential contradictions" were revealed between the candidates' explanations and the information available in the public registers on the dividend costs of SIA Pallogs, as the publicly available decisions of the Pallogs participants' meetings provide for the non-distribution of profits.
Currently, the Deputy Director of the Director of the SRS Dace Pelēkā is the head of the SRS.
In Livani police is involved in rescuing two unattended children left, informs the Latgale Region Board of the State Police.
The news of unattended trolleys with infants was received on Friday around 7 p.m.
They were located in Livani near the former store building.
Both little girls were immediately handed over to medics to provide help.
A bag with documents and a mobile phone had also been left in the trolley.
Within less than half an hour, the law enforcement officers figured out the possible location of the parents of the children and went there.
Arriving at the woman's civil husband's home, police officers found out that the woman was sleeping because of being heavily under the influence of alcohol.
According to preliminary information, the woman born in 1992 visited her girlfriend, where she had alcohol.
Already going home after a joint meeting, the woman has decided to leave the children at the store in unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the Orphan's Court about the incident, which will also decide on the further fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has introduced all the recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the Krievu Island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five State Audit Office (SAO) recommendations regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development on Krievu Island for the implementation of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the nearest meeting of the Board of the Freeport of Riga.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the opinion of the SAO, preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Freeport of Riga Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor, Deloitte, and the recommendations provided for the improvement of project management in the further phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the State Audit Office on the expediency of the implementation of the Krievu Island project, we treat the implementation of the project and the European Commission (EC) very responsibly.
I would like to emphasize that all the construction works planned within the framework of the project have been fully completed within the set deadlines and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the SAO and also the stevedores, that the main objective of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the SAO regarding project management and monitoring issues," says Sanita Kaire, the project manager of Krievu Island.
The current long-term action plan for the implementation and monitoring of the project was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the involved parties and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the planned construction process monitoring tools, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan for reaching the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the SAO, has been supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the deadlines of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Freeport of Riga.
The project management plan has been developed anew for the improvement of the project management and the reduction of potential risks, defining the project management areas and indicating the developed documents that ensure the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure scheme has been developed, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualification and functions of the employees.
In order to improve the communication of the Freeport of Riga Authority with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of stakeholders has been developed, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders for successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for entering into a service contract or start-up of procurement will be more detailed in the future, and the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, the Krievu Island has built a port infrastructure that meets the world standards - four new deep-water berths, railway drives, as well as engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of last year, achieving a saving of 10.6 million euros of the planned funding.
Due to the threat, Slovakia has been intensified security at airports.
After receiving a non-specific threat, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, the Interior Ministry said.

"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analysing the information we've received," he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will be held in the Slovak capital on September 16, with the participation of all countries of the bloc except Britain.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of Britain's Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the Presidency of the EU until January.
German researchers are discussing the number of "Berlin Wall Victims."
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the communist yoke of the former East German border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims are still not allayed.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, 1841 people who have tried to get out of their territory were murdered by the communist authorities of Western Germany, from 1945 to 1989.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and occasionally corrects the number of victims.
This year, another 11 deaths have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned a family trying to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also defectors of the Soviet army.
"The final extent of the damage caused by the dual evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits the museum's director, Alexander Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an effort to escape from a communist-controlled country are being groomed and not disappeared," Hildebrandt's statement said in a statement released by Hildebran.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number 1841 is inconclusive," Johens Statt, an expert in the history of the Free University of Berlin, said in an interview with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
Together with other researchers from the Free University of Berlin, he is currently reviewing the alleged suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
Previously, researchers estimated that only on the Berlin Wall, communists murdered 138 people.
In view of those people who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or get to the West through the territory of neighboring countries, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is still significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of different victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 years after shrinking with border controls died of heart attack, it should have consequences for this "lander border," Hildebrante believes.
But the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people who may have died as a result of their treatment and those whose death is caused by a prolonged wait in hot weather on the bus at the border.
Regardless of its, the records of the victims are not easy, as the Communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers should examine the documents in various scattered archives, says Stat.
However, the State Group has recently found new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with the accreditation of a coach; this is a surprise for himself.
In recent days, Kaspars Pone, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), has arrived at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro with the accreditation of a coach, but he himself is surprised by this.
On Wednesday, extensive excitement arose after the statements made by the coach of the Olympic swimmer Aļona Ribakova, German Yakubovsky, who revealed that Pone had decided to go to Rio de Janeiro at the last minute while the coach should remain at home.
Initially, the list of riders were confirmed by swimmers Aļona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the president of the federation Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for the Olympic Games by five participants, and even before departure, Aldons Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans will be and he is being searched for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he did not," Pone said, expressing the opinion that it did not affect Ribakov's result.
At the request of the federation, the Uwhah coach took care of helping her.
Pone, who is himself a member of the LOC executive committee, sharply criticized the activities of the LOK, taking off the blame on the organization overseeing Olympic sports.
In my opinion, it is unethical to approve five persons in the LOC Executive Committee and not to take any of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough space for the Swimsuit," Pone said that the work of the federation and their presidents was not appreciated by the public, recalling that the presidents of the federation do not receive salaries.
Pone also criticized Jakubovskis himself, saying that before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone couldn't tell you why he had a coach's accreditation at the Olympics, which most likely had to be due to Jakubovskis.
"I was announced as president of the federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I received the accreditation of the coach and now I can't get anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
Until the last moment, I thought Germans will be, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a couple of days before Ribakova’s start, she had a conversation face-to-face with Pone and after which the swimmer was with tears in her eyes, however, the President of the LPF himself said that it was a mundane conversation with the desire to make the athletes before the start.
Pone reminded that LPF oversees five sports that are in the Olympic program, and in four of them there are trainings for children in Latvia as well.
The President of the Federation expressed that drowning issues are also very important in Latvia, and he has also talked about such programs, while in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup stage could take place in Latvia.
Being in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programs.

"In the measures for the protection and multiplication of fish resources, each activity is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, carrying out both the cultivation and introduction of juvenile fish into the Daugava basin and by implementing other activities," Kunickis said.
This year, more than 600 000 small annual salmon and sea trout will be admitted to the mouth of the Daugava River.
For the second year, juvenile fish is marked before being introduced by cutting off the fatty fin.
Today's cargo brought in with 25 000 salmon babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, in a scientifically based species and in a numerical amount, the introduction of juvenile fish and larvae takes place in the Daugava and its basin water bodies.
Propagation of fish resources in the Daugava and its basin water bodies in accordance with the laws and regulations shall be performed by Bior on the basis of the expert-examination of losses caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo as a result of economic activities and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken in order to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
In its turn, the State Environmental Service, on the basis of the abovementioned expert-examination, shall take a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo’s annual compensation amount in the fish resource recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo in cooperation with the association "We for Fish" for the fifth year places 400 artificial fish spawning nest in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ikskile.
Cooperation with the association, promoting the natural spawning of fish, is Latvenergo in addition to supported an initiative within the framework of the fish resource restoration programme.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important event that promotes the protection and propagation of fish resources in the Daugava.

The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to a smile in the face and lightness on the legs for only a couple of minutes.
"Please do not look for a program, because we have consciously chosen not to publish it before, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste of Sansusi can be captured only by spending all three days in it," invites the initiator and owner of the festival, opera baritone Armands Siliņš.
The festival's goal is opened on Friday at 8 p.m. At 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, she will appoint Garland as a Supreme Court judge.
Harry Reid, leader of the Senate Democratic Party, is convinced that if she becomes president, then she will nominate Merika Garland as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since March when he was nominated by President Obama.
Much Maconnel, the leader of the Senate majority, said the next president would choose who will replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonin Skali.
On Thursday, during his conference, Reid announced he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
A spokeswoman for the raid later told me that he hadn't spoken about this topic with Clinton and these were just speculations.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "swing the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District of Appeal Court of Appeal.
Reid said the Republicans that blocking Garland's nominations are "includes" and behaves in the interests of Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said Trump was not fit for the president's work.
Treats announces a nude photo calendar for women and men.
The journal Treats will collaborate with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar for Pirrere in the style of the 70s of the last century.
In its 2017 NU Muses calendar, the new supermodels are planned to show, not naked celebrities.
Earlier this year, Treats magazine president Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine."
This magazine is for women.
It looks like he's also talking about the calendar.
In a press release about the creation of the calendar, Shaw tells: "We must return to the depiction of an enduring and classic nudity in pictures, where a woman's body does not confuse, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos electronically or personally to casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland's sharks have the longest lifespans from all the vertebrates on our planet.
The shark researcher Julius Nielsen says the long-lived record belongs to a female, which could be 272 to 512 years old and five metres long.
A French court rejects a claim to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A French court dismissed Calais' authorities' request to demolish dozens of self-created shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At a hearing this week in Calais, the authorities indicated that the state should quench 72 self-made shops, where people sell various goods in the camp area, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-created restaurants.
The Prefect Office of Kale pointed out that these self-made companies must be demolished because they form the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential, as food provided by the government and the support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, in which the number of occupants continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made boutiques and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for expulsions of people who have created 72 self-made stores, but it understands the concerns of the Prefect of Calais.
Judge Jean-France Molla said food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely humble conditions."
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids Café, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes and advises on asylum issues hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult companions.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of a children's cafe.
A letter addressed to the Guardian stated that the liquidation of the cafe "should be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities "Help for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" reported that the number of residents of the "Jungle" camp has increased to 9000 people, the highest figure since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain wins silver in the rugby-7 series fight, when Fiji's national team skillfully wins gold.
The British team's impressive performance in the rugby-7 series ended on Thursday when the exciting finals of the Deodoro Stadium in Rio Fiji's national team overwhelmingly crushed them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a masterclass in the control of the ball, play balls with a leg, a support game and a brutal power game, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in the history of its existence.
The defeat brought a reputable consolation prize - a silver medal that was Britain's third medal that day. The British national team can be proud of its success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough fight in the semifinals, in which the Boxe team suffered defeat with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, possibly played off for Britain in the final.
But anyway, the Fiji team is in its best shape right now to win the 15-man team as well.
Although unlikely, however, some consolation to Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton won a gold medal. This is Fiji national team head coach Ben Ryan - former English coach from Wimbledon.
For Britain, it was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all the games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji spectacularly started the match, repelling Britain's power techniques for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and comrades, it was like a run-up to several oncoming buses and the world series champions took the lead with 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau scored the first touchdown.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also further increased the lead by realising the touchdown in the right wing.
The score of 12:0 and the British team hadn't even really touched the ball.
Mitchell's great power technique prevented the beaten Leon Nakarava scored three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's score.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, securing the lead over Britain to 17:00.
After the replay, Nakarava further increased its lead and had more than a minute left until the end... the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward British force techniques and crossed the line, scoring points.
The touchdown secured a score of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji were born to play in rugby-7 matches, while the British were still learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a profound change in halftime, breaking the Fiji player line... a full four minutes, which, according to the first half standards, was fine, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic match of the team, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score in the British team's good, making a touchdown in the left corner and scoring at 36:7, but the game was already lost, meanwhile, fans of the South Sea Islanders sang, waving flags and danced into the stands.
One cannot admire Fiji's cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliome made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another touchdown at the end of the game.
When the final whistle of the game was heard, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British were able to sit down on the grass after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the Britons were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams scored on the ground and South Africans lost by only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Braun put Bock in the lead, but in the second half, Den Norton crossed the line with a brilliant mastery and took the ball between the poles, securing the British victory.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England's rugby-15 team player Anthony, the great power play at the end of the game secured the team a win and another silver medal.
The coach's fight with cancer has inspired Helen Glower and Heather Staning to win the rowing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helena Glovere and Heatree Stationn gold was of particular importance at the Estacio da Lagoa track.
While there are only both athletes in the boat, they accompanied Robin Williams' echoes, which inspired them until the second Olympic gold medal in the rowing of couples for women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport to have made such success.
They were unquestionably dominated because they scored for the 39th time an unsurpassed, unprecedented win.
The two great athletes with the elegance of the swan gliding on the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each of the gold medals there stands a whole team in rowing, working hard for athletes to continuously improve their performance and the biggest contribution to their success was made by the coach, who did not know 30 months ago or will experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and it also happened.
If you didn't, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams' cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This trio was fortunate that William was able to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 offseason and to reduce the duration of the break to a minimum if they can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked down 6, 10 and even 15-metre long distances, although the doctor said it would suffice a few steps.
It all started.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After winning, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who was very upset all morning and talked more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Staning, who served in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The 3 years of Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have achieved anything, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training matte or better coach.
Helen Glover and Heatre Staning haven't lost in any races in five years.
The couple reach such tremendous speed with which competitors can not compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started getting closer, the lead in Staning and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted: "Keeps the rhythm, keeps the rhythm."
Not losing concentration is really important.
We managed a good start, but at the same time we had no high expectations.
That day we didn't have the intention to overthrow the records, but just row well and win the race and that's what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and television adventurer Steve Bashall.
For the time being, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I'm an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Koleggovi will "drive to the last position of the head of the SRS".
According to him, now Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers) is already "principally important" in order to approve Kolegova, the candidate promoted by the Minister of Finance, in the position of the head of the SRS.
Rajevskis estimated that both Kučinskis and Reizniece-Ozola in this government the approval of the head of the SRS is the "first big decision", which can affect him as the future of politicians.
If now the position in the choice of the candidate for the position of the head of the SRS will begin to change, then this will have a negative impact on their image in the public administration.
The agenda of next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of the transfer of the head of the VVD Kolegova to the position of the Director General of the SRS, according to the government's agenda.
Kolegova was promoted to the position of the head of the SRS by the Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after Ināra Pētersone resigned from the management of the service and when the competition for the position of Director General of the SRS ended without a result.
On Thursday, August 11, Dace Pelēka, Acting Head of the SRS, admitted in an interview with Latvijas Radio that if she were offered to stand for the position of manager, then she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that he would not consider other candidates for the position of the head of the SRS for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, the leader of the parliamentary faction of the National Alliance, also admitted that the NA continues to support Koleggova under the leadership of the SRS.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is threatened by the inability to form a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the deficit level to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) requested by the euro area.
Estimates that despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near term.
One of the reasons why the EC, however, did not introduce sanctions against the two countries mentioned is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative sentiment.
Critics, however, point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, from the beginning agreeing on uniform rules and then unable to apply them in life.
Thus, for example, the President of the German Bundesbank Jens Weidmann has pointed out that Europe loses its credibility in this way, creating the perception that the European Union's rules are recommendative, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the adoption of the deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain until 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress made by both countries in the coming months, at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial forecasts suggest that Portugal's target could be achieved in due time and already this year the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the purchase costs of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures in the next two years should be 0.5% of GDP per year.
The fact that, for eight months, the Spanish political parties have not managed to agree on the formation of a government, is particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year is becoming more and more likely to be held for the third time.
However, opinion polls show that the political picture of the third election would not significantly change the political scene in the country.
The most popular party remains the popular party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoy, which would again win less than 33% of the vote in the election.
Only the Socialists have increased their popularity, while the popularity of the parties "Podemos" or "Together We Can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Citizens" have slightly decreased.
The People's Party wants to achieve the involvement of socialists and Ciudadanos in the government still this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the draft budget for 2017 for approval by mid-October.
As announced by Rafael Hernando, a representative of the People's Party parliamentary faction, if the government fails to form and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a European mockery of the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In the fifth year surveying the beaches, the activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found has increased every year, and most of the visitors of bathing sites are to blame here.
The most polluted bathing areas are in Riga.
The capital city council explains that bathing areas are cleaned up every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left on the land during rainfall can be washed into the water, thus greatly damaging its quality.
Except for the Liepaja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement this week was circulated by volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
For the fifth year, walking along the Gulf of Riga, the activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year's critical assessment has come in.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste per 100 meters on the beach can even exceed 200 units," says Jānis Ulme, a spokesman for the expedition "My Sea".
When he was contacted by Latvian Radio, he was on Tūja beach, where the procession of volunteers along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, among the various household waste and the remnants of picnics, even the fluorescent lamps have had to collect even fluorescent light bulbs left in the sand of the sea.
Ulme, participant and organizer of the hike, says the population is to blame for the pollution.
"The main source is the visitors of the beach themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the degradation stage, they are no longer possible to identify them, and for butts, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches are also bathing places in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva, on average, almost 800 waste units have been collected every hundred meters, which is a critically a lot.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that almost every step of the way also tossing the signs of warning or prohibition are placed everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites together - Daugavgriva, Evening Bulls and Vecāķi - unfortunately come together large and far beyond the desired or the goal to which Latvia is supposedly moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," concludes the environmental defender.
The cleaning of bathing places in Riga takes place every day, on the hottest days of summer even twice, explains the representative of the Council Uģis Vidauskis.
However, the fight with the dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"Those who litter, drink alcohol, smoke and do all those things that can not, even special signs do not work," Vidauskis points out.
Therefore, Vidauskis is asking visitors to report polluted pollutants to the police as well.
Can be called the police, boldly point out these violations and in this way everyone fight.
Perhaps some new warnings can be put on, but as I said, it will hardly change the situation as radically.
"Since everyone must simply turn together and be intolerant of such transgressors," he stresses.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, like other years, the quality of water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that in all 56 bathing areas the water quality has been good all the time and there are no bathing restrictions.
"For the last time we will take the analysis at the end of August", says Normunds Kadiķis, Senior Environmental Health Specialist of the Inspectorate.
During heavy rainfall, the land-based waste can be washed into the water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says the environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of leader in the Putin administration.
Left the post himself?
Vladimir Putin has announced to the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would leave this post and will henceforth be the President's special representative for nature conservation, ecology and transport.
Announcing the changes, Putin made the words of Ivanovs acknowledging the words of the television cameras: "Dear Sergey Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you perform the duties assigned to you.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in the post of the presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I understand your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in the new position you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and it made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Considering that the State Duma elections are expected in Russia next month, there have been rumours that this move is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible replacement for Putin as president, so the claim that he himself wanted to hold the position of presidential representative for nature conservation and transport has raised doubts.
According to the archives of Lsm.lv, Ivanovs is the Colonel General of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an ancient and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, as Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
Meanwhile, the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of the reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which, among other things, provided for the resuscitation of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 he was the deputy prime minister of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and the export of weapons.
Now, after leaving the office of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain its seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration Vaino will work.
Vaino comes from the family council party in the elite.
The position of the Head of the Presidential Administration was recommended by Ivanovs himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have long been known.
From the time when we worked in government under your leadership.
And for the last almost five years, we have been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am sure that by all professional and personal characteristics he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
Blajot comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet party elite.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988, it was its first secretary.
The online publication "Meduza" with a reference to the book "Estonia's Self-Detection and Independence" writes that in the late 80's Karl Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against the participants of the demonstrations.
However, he had received a refusal and soon lost his post.
Shortly afterwards, Guine has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and is fluent in Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the president's protocol administration.
As reported, in the last weeks Russia has been rocked by the suspension and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several regions.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is rearranging the ruling elite ahead of the 2018 elections.
One of the main features - more and more often representatives of power structures are held to the leading positions.
Also, judo wrestler Nikiforenko loses in the first fight of the Olympics.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo wrestler has finished his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins admitted to Latvian Television that there was very little hope for Nikiforenko, and it was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the judo wrestler suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
Significantly, in order to get to the Olympic road sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
As reported, Yevgeny Borodavko in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki stayed for two and a half minutes, until the opponent succeeded in a shot worth a clean victory.
Thus, Latvia has concluded the judo competition in Rio.
Dreams disappear into the sands of Rio.
Judith Yevgeny Borodavko was introduced on Thursday.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but the ambitious ones can sometimes get surprised.
He didn't get.
Artūrs Nikiforenko's task was even more complicated, because the experience is less and the opponent is also respectable.
The outcome is similar, even though he held on attami for almost a minute and a half than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately Latvian judo players lack the most ambitions.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial stute Vladimirs Šestakovs passed from the leadership of the federation, Aleksandrs Jackevičs left Latvia, "Golden Score" no longer took place, - the development of judo is on a declining curve.
Jackevich, who is advising the Kazakh judo here, and Vsevold Zelonija does not see the heirs.
But if you don't grow up, there won't be either.
And that's the federation's prerogative.
Therefore, as from another galaxy "The Morning Panorama", the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to win medals in Rio was heard.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Šmēdiņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - the losers have finished the games.
The Latvian duo had a slight retreat - it was possible to lose, but not more than with four points in two sets.
The tension was still thrilled by the protracted previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling above the windy court swirled throughout the match.
The brave winds caused additional complications.
At first it seemed that it could be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive.
But didn't become.
Playing against the Latvian duo here was quite simple.
Serve so to Samoilov and wait for him to burst.
Against Canada, it broke down against Cuba at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not joking.
Schmed's time could fish because there was little work, but when he was, he did it honorably.
The Brazilian Samoilov and Smedine were able to win two sets, because the first took the lead with 16:15, but also stayed on 16, exhausting the losing points limit.
But could also lose with 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third was already in the sign of Evandra's serve.
The chain was formed - an inconclusively captured serve, the second pass often flies too close to the net and Samoilovs had very few options for an effective attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov against the Cubans on the square, then this time he worked more successfully, and only on Sasha's loss would be unprofessional.
Kreilis also made a mistake, and quite symbolically, that the last ball in the block was hit by him.
Losing team.
This time there was definitely a lack of luck - in the third set alone, two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two aissi were next to the line.
The controversial episodes also decided in favor of opponents.
If in the first two games Evandra was tormented by serve, then they were very productive against us.
All together summed up in the loss on the scoreboard.
Now you need to calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Maybe it was like many to live next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours on the way.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but it's faster to come here and better to acclimatize.
Maybe there was a failure with finding the peak of the sporty shape.
For now, more questions than answers.
Our bee-hiskey games are over.
The dream of medals ended.
What next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also Jurmala Masters.
Smediņš and Samoilovs have never been friends in life and will not be, because he is too different personalities.
But it is also not necessary.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce may also arise, because the fault will be sought not only in yourself, but also in a partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the boy, but John and Tom have already tried and also parted, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to begin to conquer the peaks of the world.
You can try Haralds Regza, Alexander Solovey, Edgars Točs, return to Mārtiņš Pļaviņš, but it will not be better than this option, which proved himself not once in the World Cup stages.
The copacabana sand didn't smile at them this time.
And everything.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples come into circulation, and only the rare height is less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Ours doesn't stay taller.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to live in the places offered by game organizers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players don't stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, the rather modest prices were required for the rather modest accommodation offered to journalists.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the rent of apartments.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time, the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border between Kopakaba and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 metres away, in a buncha Arena half an hour walk.
The area is safe enough, because the faretal of the favela, however, the vigilance should not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some immediately imagine, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another medal dream was dreamed up on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa lagged behind her personal records in the 100-meter hurdles and high jump.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgy and Bess" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgy and Bessa" was the first production in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeatedly taken.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsis Art Festival and Liepāja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s masterpiece.
"We are very glad that after a ten-year break, when Liepāja was last able to enjoy the opera's production, this version of the concert production of the great George Gershwin "Porgy and Bess" opera is enjoyable to be enjoyed by our new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber", says Baiba Bože, the director of the concert hall "Great Amber".
The opera "Porgy and Bess" is a story told in vivid musical language about love, its volatility, passion, as well as household tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairišs.
What I like the most - listening or playing this opera, there are always such sticking points - famous tunes, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or choir, or or orchestras.
"It is the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the opera "Porgy and Bess" concert stage Andris Poga.
Opera visitors agree that this is a grand event.
They are very glad to hear this world-famous Gershwin opera.
Blessed is that you can feel the breath of the world in Liepāja.
"Execution professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert performance was special in that the orchestra played in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" for the first time in the orchestra pit and for the first time a concert performance of the opera took place.
The square next to the renovated building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks told the opening of the anniversary exhibition of Rozentāls that the museum’s own address in the future could be not Krišjāņa Valdemāra iela 10a, but Jaņa Rozentāla laukums 1.
Māra Lāce, the director of the museum, admitted that re-registration of the address will create a considerable bureaucratic burden, however, in general, this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed with the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga has put a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, creating a monument to Burkards Dzenis, Janis Rozentāls, which stands next to the museum.
The then director of the museum, Vilhelms Purvītis, was one of the initiators of the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little bit overwhelmed by my conscience all the time - but Vilhelms Purvītis, where will we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think"... said Lāce.
The building of the National Museum of Art was officially opened its doors in May this year after major reconstruction and modernization.
Reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace will finally begin this week.
The castle will be restored by SIA "Velve" for approximately 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two spectator halls, as well as adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract six million euros of money from European Union funds for the project, however, the Director of the Property Department of the Riga City Council Oleg Burov admits that for the time being there is no clarity about the European funds for the project yet.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start repairs to the VEF Culture Palace, attracting the European Structural Funds, is, we are waiting for a decision for months, real action from officials of the Ministry of Finance, will be the money allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that it all depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you decide that Brussels would not take a decision here.
At the moment, we are seeing the formation of another circle of discussion, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed in terms," says Burovs.
As reported earlier than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the immediate renovation of the building was immediately impending renovation.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work in unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent reconstruction works, where everyone will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and the improvement of the surrounding area.
It provides for the arrangement of the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as the renovation of the facade of the building.
The second is to improve the supply of services of the VEF Culture Palace.
It plans to improve the interior, wall and ceiling of the building, stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange internal engineering communications of the building.
The third - improvement of the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" the legendary rock band can be introduced to the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various objects characterizing "Līvus" - photographs arranged in the timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to 2010 when the end of the group's activities are announced.
Participants’ stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the general public that reflected the creative work of the band "Līvi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects of the collection of the Liepāja Museum.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
The musicians who have been associated with the band "Līvi" and their relatives also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "Līvu" can be traced back to 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was created in the Liepāja Culture House, which was led by Juris Pavitols.
The ensemble participated in its original composition at the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republican shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place, when Juris Pavitols met Ēriks Ķiģelis and the Metalurgs Culture Palace founded a group inviting Ingrīda Gūtmanis, Andris Krūziņš and Jānis Grodums to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys were noticeably different from the generally accepted stereotype of the stage singer," says music reviewer Klass Vāvere about the band.
The band has such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācenājs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, the concert garden "Pūt, vējiņi" will take place in the concert garden of Liepaja "Līvi" "Līvi" 40th anniversary celebration "LĪVIfesto 2.".

Zbigņevs Stankevičs: Comes time, and the truth rises.
Metropolitan Zbigņevs Stankevičs, Metropolitan of the Catholic Church of Latvia, emphasizes in an interview with The Independent that if we want to gain the power of life, the Gospel message must be placed at its center.
For the power of truth is greater than the evil and the darkness.
Many are already on their way to the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What news believers will get there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has been expressed by the Pope's nunqy.
Consequently, the content of the main message is also up to him.
It is also a kind of tradition that the way of the Cross is led by Bishop Jānis Bulis.
He, too, will make his own message.
I was running a festive vigil service the day before.
Last year I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house captured in it, the Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I watch what is happening in the world and try to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Gospel message should be put in the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel answers the most painful problems of a person’s life and gives him inspiration for the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in Cesis, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "must return to the understanding of the full man."
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the church message?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
A man dying on the roadside is robing in the Indian capital.
In the Indian capital, no one has seemed to know about a man who was hit by the road - it turns out that he has laid aside an hour on the road and then still robbed, informs the BBC.
A man who was identified as a Matibulon reportedly drove a rickshaw during the day but worked as a security guard at night.
Matibulon at 5:30 in the morning went home along the road when he was hit by a car.
A recording of the observation cameras suggests that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
An hour later, when no one seemed to know about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a garment.
About 90 minutes after the shooting at the scene, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to hospital, where he died of injuries sustained.
Inga Kolegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, invoking her candidacy to the position of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), has saved the government from the fall, according to Ojārs Skudra, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kolegova's explanation of the withdrawal of candidacy in connection with the controversy in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In an ant conversation with the agency LETA, he had a hard time to imagine that next week at the government meeting "Unity" would support Kolegova's candidacy.
Consequently, if the ministers of "Unity" voted against, but Kolegova would still be confirmed to the post, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis.
At the same time, it is also a concession to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
Predicting whether it will be possible to find a suitable candidate with the help of the competition, Skudra admitted that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be selected, or the institution as acting director-general will continue to lead Dace Grey.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being considered, it is a hint to Grey that he is not allowed to participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the State Environmental Service Kolegova has decided to withdraw her candidacy for the position of Director General of the SRS.
Due to the objections of "Unity", the government postponed the approval of Kolegova for a week as the Director General of the SRS for a week.
Following the decision of the government to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she is still ready to become the head of the SRS.
However, later thoughts changed - on Friday in her application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola she points out that she recalls her consent to transfer to the position of the head of the SRS and this is not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of the Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis Andrejs Vaivars explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant position of the Director General of the SRS.
A crash involving a police car occurred in the centre of Riga.
In the centre of Riga this afternoon, a road traffic accident involving a State Police car.
The police car with sounds and light signals turned on has hurried to the highest category call until Krišjāņa Barona and Dzirnavu streets collided with another car.
Police explain the circumstances of what happened, but the initial information shows that the other car has not missed a police car.
A woman was injured in the accident.
Population has shrunk in Riga this year
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) informed LETA.
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the data of the EU statistical office "Eurostat", Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly in the first place among the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123, and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed at the LNMA.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMA), Baiba Gailīte, representative of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, told LETA.
Currently, repairing the glazed atrium damage to the museum, which was due to the operation of skateboarders, has been successfully completed.
Warning pictograms will be placed near it in the coming days.
Its residents will be told that the cover tends to be slippery in rain and snow, it is not allowed to travel by cars, as well as ride bicycles, roller skates and skateboards.
Ushakov also wrote about the above on the social network "Facebook" at that time, pointed out that the damage to any security poses, but "looks inappropriate", and skateboarders will "be" have to be chased.
Celebrations for children and parents - new children's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
This summer, the Riga Municipality has installed even two more new playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
A spacious, multifunctional toy ship with various assembling elements, bridges, games, tubes and slides is installed on Kipsala beach.
The playground is intended for children of all ages.
Swings and various balancing elements are also installed in the square.
The fantasy world for small sailors is enhanced by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships seen there.
In the playground between Čiekurkalna 4 and 5. cross-lined building, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, play balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastics area with rings of strength and coordination training, along with other sports elements.
Under the area there is a rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colourful paving surface is laid to the playground from the side of the street.
The reconstructed road section has been opened in the medumi.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of SJSC Latvijas Valsts ceļi (LVC), as well as representatives of the builders SIA "Binders" and local governments today opened the reconstructed section of the Russian border of the main state road (Grebneva) -resepart of the Russian border (Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,-4.-163.05 km).
Roads are a public business card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of the European Union funds, the situation on the main roads of the country is improving.
"According to the forecasts, during this planning period, the funds available for roads will be acquired already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most loaded roads of very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of residents in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union," Uldis Augulis emphasized when cutting the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for Latvian roads in close-knit time will be presented to the government.
Construction works in the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) SIA Binders started last year and this year they continued after the technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The road construction has been completely restored on the reconstructed road section and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils, so the whole road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," informed the Chairman of the Board of the LVC Jānis Lange.
The country's main roads are the most busy, and by 2018 we plan to get all the country's main roads in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, providing periodic maintenance in a timely manner and replacing the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"This, of course, will require adequate funding, and all travelers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to put the road financing system in order," Lange noted.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting in the Medumi center are arranged.
Significant earthworks have been carried out: in four stages large-scale decay and large-scale works of dug and embankment, levelled the longitudinal profile of the road, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and the turning area for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient load-bearing capacity and the terrain was not transparent due to mountainous valleys, as well as the old road shared terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the section of the motorway from the border of Daugavpils city to the now reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of works in more than 1100 kilometres of public roads.
Information on all repairs planned in the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired results of weight loss, the right choice of food combinations is very important," admits Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kuklierene.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A well-considered combination of dietary products can help not only to reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel cheerful.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich food such as poultry or protein cocktail creates not only a feeling of satiety, but also reduces the craving for large meals in the next meals.
Such a combination of dishes is able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that Cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat in the abdominal area.
Eggs contain a metabolic-promoting nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Calm uptake of a sufficient amount of this nutrient can reduce the level of cortisol, hence the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, to which fresh berries are added, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oatmeal and berries contain fiber, which, according to the conclusions of Canadian scientists, controls ghrell - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus a feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are assistants in reducing weight, and also do not allow the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to do wonders in reducing weight.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so promote the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, the protein slows down the digestive process and provides a feeling of satiety for a longer period of time.
For lunch, you can eat chicken with a salad or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
Fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, starch in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
The fruit decomposes in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not decompose until they reach the third or fourth degree in the digestive process, which occurs in the intestines.
Starch breaks down in three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
Eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "cuckick" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products together with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptyaline, which is found in saliva, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids inhibit not only the digestion of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires a variety of digestive juices, each with different strengths, features and time when you need to get into the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymoon, muskamelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach along with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, however, the same can not be said about fat and protein - fats inhibit protein digestion.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein products is consumed, avoid fat use altogether.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains protein) with a whole avocado (contains fat).
Such a combination inhibits effective weight reduction.
How better to cook?
"The cooking, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient composition of the products," the nutritionist says.
In most cases, nutrients go to a loss by boiling foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases by directly boiling.
After cooking vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables by steaming them, too.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopen increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat deprives the natural properties of the proteins contained in them, making them more digestible.
Also, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, but the freezing of fiber does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blood-redding iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products than blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-ring iron by consuming non-blood-yellowing products in the diet along with sources of vitamin C such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-curative iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which ensures the delivery of oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of the salad, add to them healthy fats, such as olive or linseed oil.
When cooking sandwiches with salmon, add to vitamin D rich salmon or sardines of additive-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed by the intestine and plays an important role in the formation of bones.
Oats (as well as other whole grains) together with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, black currants, raspberries and other fruits or berries help to stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect criticized for Asian caricature
Snapchat representatives say this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators claim it is racially insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identity in a rather absurd way.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit into a painting by Roy Lichstein.
Lenses are foggy, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million converted selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes publicly noticeable.
The effects of Snapchat lenses have been criticised in the past, receiving reproaches that the app promotes too black-and-white or light complexes of facial skin as a benchmark of perfect beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to form crooked eyes, crooked teeth and round cheeks, and some critics dubbed it a racist Asian cartoon – the “yellow face”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public negations erupted on Wednesday when the publications The Verge and the Motherboard said the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the lens's purpose is to portray Anime's images, not to caricature people of Asian descent.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects were reminded of the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied similarity with Anime.
The Twitter post of American art student of Korean descent, Grace Sparapani, wrote a wide resonance on the images. In an email, she points out that the effects of the lens are "offifying and uncomfortable, to say the least."
She added that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between the asian cartoons and the effects of the lenses.
This suggests that the effect of the lens is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the understanding of racism.
Snapchat isn't the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meeting rooms to Hollywood and devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people, representing different races, unlike older residents, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "nothing like this doesn't go unnoticed in today, 25-year-old Katie Jou said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Medium Product Manager Jou deleted her Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article, Medium and telephone interview she explained that, in her opinion, problems with race arise due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support the diversity of the race.
Jou criticized the company's management, which mainly consists of white men and then concluded his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether the company employs some other racial representatives, but they do not hold a position so that they can safely and comfortably express their opinion", believes Chinese-born American Jou.
Her view is also shared by others, while Snapchat hasn't responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the origins of its employees, but its spokesman revealed that the company had hired a staff specialist who will focus on the presence of racial minorities in the company, which are not widely represented and will contribute to the inclusion of the company.
Jou, on the other hand, will not recreate his Snapchat account, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right."
The House of Congress announces that military officials have misrepresented reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the congressional chamber said U.S. Central Commanders misrepresented the reports depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than they actually are.
Analysts of the Central Command intelligence express general frustration at the interim report of the task unit established by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Republican Representatives of the Defense Funding Sub-Committee, stating that their leadership controlled reports on American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report says that the intelligence reports, which were approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than they actually do. Facts were regularly misrepresenting better achievements than other intelligence analyses.
California Republican spokesman Ken Calvert says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policy makers receive false reports."
The mistakes of the Centcom management can be found in the senior management of the organization.
This 10-page long report illustrates in detail the existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the Central Command for Americans' efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide irrefutable evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration would have forced the reports to be misrepresented, this suggests that the Centcom's management has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the press releases, statements and reports of the Central Administration to Congress portrayed the situation in a significantly more positive light than they actually did.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly announced that the Mosul Recovery Operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Kansas Republican Party, Mike Pompeo, said in a report: "A multi-month investigation is clearly attestation of this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Management chief officials misrepresented reports, portraying ISIS's threat in Iraq's weaker than they were in reality.
The Republican Party formed a working group, finding out that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being misrepresented.
As the investigation continues, a report published on Thursday will be followed by new discoveries in the case.
Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence conducts an investigation of the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
Members of the Intelligence Administration Committee's Democratic Party on Thursday released their own report, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party's working group.
Democratic representative Adam B. In his report, Shif said in a report, between 2014 and 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence service assessment reports for ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information," worsened the work of analysts and "spread facts that were not true."
But Shiff and Democratic Party members added that there is no evidence that White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports, according to a "previously stated or political stance."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Inspectorate initiated an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evan said Pentagon would not comment on the congress report until the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Administration call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not just about the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from Central Governors on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade-old events when Centcom's reconnaissance analyst Gragori Hournttoister released a study, claiming that George V. The Bush administration launched the Afghan war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hooker also played an important role in the opening of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official figures reported that the Hugher team revealed that, in contrast to public reports, air strikes on Islamic State oil plants have not significantly worsened the financial position of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Management.
At the moment, the commander of Centcom General Lolid Austin III, received a sharp criticism, as many lawmakers believed that the war reports describe the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and General Joseph L took his place. Votel.
The U.S. duel with Great Britain in women's field of hockey, wins the U.S., thus scoring its fourth victory in a row.
A day after winning over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday, Katie Bama scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she couldn't remember if she would have ever succeeded.
She said, "I have no idea.""
I'm not one of those people who count on my goals.
But she knows that the American score at the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them a draw in their group with Great Britain, which remained unbeaten on Thursday after winning over Japan with a score of 2:0 left.
Britain and the US will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round match.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will determine only which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and the second.
The first place winner will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch national team, which is the leader of the second group for a little longer.
No matter how Saturday's game fails, the Americans have already evoked a storm of surprises, four years ago in London taking the last place among the 12 teams.
There was also Bama in that team
She grew up in Blubel, she took the field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters was already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the team's youngest player in history.
She did not get to the 2008 Olympics because she did not get into the final.
But 2012 was unsuccessful for her and her team.
The next year, the Englishman Craig Parham was appointed coach of the team and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
In London, we didn't put as much work as they do now.
We've changed absolutely everything.
In Thursday's game, Bama opened the scoring, scoring in the first half with a back shot from close range.
India started the game without winning in its account, but their team was very fierce and held a minimal score of 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama repeatedly scored a goal.
She entered the ball in the opponents' zone on the left side of the field, then noticed to get to the middle of the field and send the ball into the opponents' goal, putting the American 2:0 lead.
Melissa Gonzales scored another goal in the middle of the fourth period.
This was the first darling of the U.S. goaltender Jackie Brig, conceding one goal in each of the first three games.
She's run in.
And so also Bama.
"We are going very well at the moment," Paham said, but how well, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing dish of the depressive period is "The Diety"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt tasted such fine culinary delicacies as goose liver pate or furagra and Maryland turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato porridge and in dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmane says: "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard."
Her husband Andrew Kou adds: "It's also a message to the Americans as should be eaten."
The couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou's last book "Vegetable Sauté" describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane describes life in her book "97 Appleles" through food in the rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "The Sad Meal," published by Harper on Tuesday, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they withheld a meal together with the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop," a simple lunchee shop located in the Flatiron district and operating from 1929, when the great depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered turkey, potato porridge and vegetable salad.
When a reporter ordered a fake hare, the couple admitted that his choice is very appropriate for a conversation about the food of the Great Depression.
Ms. Ziegelmane told me that the fake hare was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny and a bean bunny.
They were made from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine how it is - to eat so many peanuts to be in place of lunch.
Mr. Kou cheered.
"It probably seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the predepression, the American dining table resembled a Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat for their men-workers and breakfast, freshly prepared pies were served for lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans. "The hearty meal" describes how the Americans adapted to the circumstances when America suddenly was no longer the land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the main attraction of the American people on a daily basis, "says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write on this topic.
Equally important became the new budget diets: unknown dishes such as the fake bunny and stews became everyday, stews were "a great way to use leftovers," noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, because the chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under the creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
The meat, which for years was the main ingredients of American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for how to cook onions stuffed with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It wasn't a popular lunch table supplement."
Ms. Ziegelmane said: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are not compatible.
Many recipes for home dishes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined the eating habits of the state, which were not experienced either before and after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised the housewives to become "economists" and accept such challenges as turning a mix of pasta and carrots into a delicious meal.
"The Rich Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Particularly interesting are the testimonies of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover "allow me to eat the cake" attitude.
Although he publicly spoke of his simple childhood and catering in Iowa, he actually ate like a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr. Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch blazer.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not recommended him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not able to cook, so White House became a place "where not only one of the most unscure tasty dishes in Washington, but also the worst cooked dishes" was served.
As soon as the country's economy recovered, most of the culinary parass of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as how to apply science in cooking, Mrs. Ziegelmane added.
The couple tells that when they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, why she was unable to throw food out.
"She was really afraid to throw out food," Mr. Kou said.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "She actually trampled people."
There was once an incident with wind cakes.
When we had eaten at the Eisenberg’s Eisenberg’s eaten, a couple of writers pulled out a dessert made from the bag at home: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's plum whipped cream," Mrs. Ziegelman said, adding that at that time it was common to give a modest dish to give a chic name.
It does not contain whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently soaked in the brown mass of spoons, which was on plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou eats a few more bites.
Sounding after an experienced "economist," he told his wife: "A striped of a hatch of a hat."
Gilead will receive a refund of legal expenses in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The county judge has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to back the expenses for the lawyers' services it paid in the case of the Hepatite C patent over the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted in the case for a $200 million fine for breaking two Merck patents that threatened it for successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a U.S. federal judge found violations in Merk's operations, such as lying after taking the oath and other unethical acts.
At the trial on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses he had incurred in defending the case.
Merck tries to gain positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C drugs, which is effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was already in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of the Gilead drug.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely taken control of the Manbye city from the Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have completely controlled the Manbyzh City in the northern part of the country near the Turkish border and the last Islamic State Soldiers have left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria's Democratic Forces (SDS) is currently cleaning up the city from the last opposing fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2000 hostages-civil residents who had been captured by militants, Charf Dan Darveyz from the military council of SDS ally Manbiffia told news agency Reuters.
"At the moment, the city is under complete control of us and we are carrying out the search for the militants," he informed Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and a couple paid a 34.2 per cent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released the 2015 tax return on Friday showing that the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent respectively.
Clinton has donated $1 million, mostly to his Clinton charity in 2015. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $ 5.3 million, speaking as a speaker and former Secretary of State has earned $3 million in income from his book for working at the State Department, published in collaboration with "Simon & Schuster."
Clinton's election ally - U.S. Virginia state senator Tim Kane and his wife Anna Holton have released their tax return for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards of financial transparency," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
By contrast, Donald Trump hides behind various pretexts and reservations, so as not to have to make promises to disclose his tax information.
Publication of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York's businessman Trump and his lawyers cite the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move," Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sam told about the Democratic Party's candidate's tax information in his Twitter post.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser, Michael Kohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to make tax releases before the audits have been completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, say his waiver raises questions about his real property amounts, donations and other business commitments, including his commitment to Russia.
Clinton added oil to fire, released a video released on Friday, where several influential Republicans are demanding Trump to make their tax information public.
She once again returned to this issue during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She announced to the crowd: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico says that in the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no tax at all for two years, and the author of the New York Times business column reported on Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today either.
The federal tax rates are a fundamental issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Varen Bafta's proposal, is promoting the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year has to pay tax at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton's performance in Omaha, Nebrask, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett called for Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under an audit of the Revenue Service and Trump feared voters rather than a tax authority.
The Clinton campaign has released tax information until 2007.
Clintons now live in Chapakwa, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 tax review of Clinton shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clintons have received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes hotel in Berlin for disconnecting Israeli long-distance code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The Jewish-born French film director stirred up a storm on social media when he discovered that there is no Israeli long-schedul code available at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin. The hotel staff bases it on the requirement of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzman, director of a documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lanzmans tried to find the Israeli long-scheduce code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not listed with countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that Israel is swept and destroyed in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
Writes Lanzmans.
Instead, the campinski Bristol hotel offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lanzman writes that he received "shocked him."
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a deliberate decision of the hotel management."
The reason for the removal of the code further enraged the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes an explanation from the hotel's officer.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, allegedly called the case "great shame."
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
It's a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany, there is even more humiliation in this network of hotels.
No clarifications are required.
The official pointed out: "We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also gained a fairly wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the hotel of “Kempinski” has simply indulned Arab clients.
Another post said "sad" stating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
The publication Der Spiegel says that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the reproaches, declaring that all this was a "misunderstanding" and apologized to Lanzman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung cites a representative of Kempinski.
And adds that the code is again added to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student-police clashed on Thursday in the São Paulo city of Brazil, where students gathered for a demonstration against reforms of the government's education system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the Ombudsman tried to cast out the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their dislike of the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of the governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin provides for the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be moved to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest took place just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing support for the suspended president Dilma Rosesef, whose impeachment was voted for by the senate.
Scott Kelums Skiners finish first, bringing Britain gold medal into cycling
Kelums Skinners finished first in the men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio bike out of Scotland last night. The British team secured the title of its champions, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making proud of the legendary Scotch Sir Chris Hoy and ending up winning the favorites for New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain scored an astonishing victory when Hoy won fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoy had already finished his athlete's career.
The problems were in the phase between the Beijing and London Olympics as they had to replace the experienced starter specialist Jamie Staf.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, his place was tried to be filled by Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton.
British coaches put hopes for Skinner, seeing in him the potential, which he later proved.
Hindes, Kenny - champions who competed with Hoy and Skinner, who set the Olympic qualifying record four years ago, but the race was better for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
Hindes after his circle were in a tight engine, Kenny took the lead and Skinner secured the lead.
Changing the strategy played an important role in the win as Hindes drove more gear to allow Kenny and Skineram especially to drive faster.
Hoys races watched as a BBC representative and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes at the moment they climbed on the podium.
The 23-year-old glambian said, "It was an unspeakable honor."
I do everything to defend my name.
In the final we set the Olympic record and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There are no better victories.
After winning with Kenny and Hoy at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes confessed that they deliberately fell on the track after the unsuccessful start.
He later refuteed that comment and British rivals were unable to prove the opposite.
This time there were no such incidents.
Hindes said: "The British flags in the stands evoked London."
Over the past 3 months, we've become a cohesive team.
We've lost in so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympics was really special.
One medal in the race for the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a score of the team's progress in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenny's score, he could really repeat Hoy's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, it would mean six gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenney was also born on March 23 (it looks like it is the British holy date, because Steve Regreprive, Mo Farah and Roger Banister are also born on this day).
Hoys is also born on that date.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "At the moment, I'm just enjoying it all.
A team ride is always the best.
Because then you can win with teammates.
Honestly, winning one is a little lonely.""
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be appointed in the knights round."
On that day, it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggin, Ed Klensey, Steve Burk and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualifying time for four-kilometre pursuits for four-kilometre.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday before the qualifying trip, he had disagreements with the commissariat when the judges called him to measure his height.
On the women's race, which will continue and conclude today, Laura Trot, Joanna Rowsel Schanda, Ellina Barker and Katie Archibalda from Milgawai set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hoping. will win medals in the mid-stage of the Olympics.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes has gone differently, after accusations of sexual and respect harassment, technical director Shane Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also end their careers.
But with the start of the first cycling races, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Cupboard becomes uncertain as an ambitious treaty has been terminated.
The future of the aluminium smelt and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear, as its main customer of the energy company has announced the suspension of cooperation.
This statement is based on the Victorian government's plans to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year-long subsidies will be suspended in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 jobs at Alcoa Portland factory are at risk.
Up to 2000, both direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as the melting room consumes about 10 per cent of the entire Victorian power supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting room, which led to a break in the operation of the Anglese power plant.
Alcoa Portland's Cupyard is working at a loss and can be closed.
These events were caused by years of speculation about the increase in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The energy supplier of the plant “AGL”, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Valley, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plants belong to the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumia, in addition to the company’s shares are also owned by the holding companies of China CITIC and Japan’s “Marubeni Corp”.
The GAL is hoping for the continuation of Portland's factory's operations, which would mean further energy supplies to the melter," its spokesman said.
The AGL said the contracts are so-called "risk-restricted contracts" to be in force from November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of validity, so they will be valid until 2017.
“AGL” plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017,” said a company spokesperson.
From the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL claims that it has already estimated a $187 million loss in its forecasts, anticipating that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue the operation of the Crew or supply it with energy.
According to the U.S. company, it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but will be terminated in November. The company does not provide explanations for which it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland Cupyard in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of the weak economy of the sector.
Egg Chief Executive Officer Stephen Mikelson said last week that according to analysts, Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago's 900 megawatts of energy during the year.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, then energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
More than 160 000 people's demands are rejected each year, with the budget cuts, the situation could worsen.
Three in five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal eviction, free legal aid and representation are refused.
The Community legal centre, which is already overwhelmed, warns that the situation will only become worse as funding is reduced.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Centre, said the latest report by the National Law Centre Association says that thousands of people in need are currently renounced legal aid.
Mr. Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not reversed, then the situation would only become worse.
He also says: "The Queensland's legal centre is constantly receiving insufficient funding, meaning that assistance is refused by thousands of people in need."
For people trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, which means that several more thousands of Queensland residents will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately halt funding cuts so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and the government of Palazchuk to invest in this important sphere.
Donald Trump's campaign sued as one of the officers pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organizers have been sued because they have not acted, having received information that its North Carolina Operations Manager turned a firearm against an employee when they were driving in the same car in February.
The incident was described in a court action filed in Charlotte's court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini - a former campaign programmer.
Broordini said he had waited months for an internal hearing to be launched, but understood that this would not happen.
Manager Earl Philip "drawed a gun, put on his right index finger on the rooster and turned a barrel against Vincent's knee," Brothi argues in his complaint.
He also argues that when submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"The guns do not have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was filed, the Republican Party's candidate for president caused a scandal to announce to the people that "The Second Amendment People," i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in the event that his rival, Hillary Clinton, would win the election and she would elect judges.
Trump's campaign officials said the media had pulled out his words from the context, and he had never incited anyone to violence.
The broths, with their claim, want to recover compensation from the campaign organisers for negligent surveillance, and from Phillips for an attack, illegal use of weapon and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump spokeswoman Houpa Hix didn't immediately comment.
We have failed to contact Phillips.
The WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency says Philip has recently left the campaign.
Also, he has not been able to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - parish and sports festival in Ķūļciems.
On Saturday in Ķūļciems for the first time people gathered for a parish and sports festival.
After celebrating ten years, this time it was decided that there would be no more lake festivals.
A new page has now been turned over.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, the darts had to be thrown in a sleeping goal, the boot flew, with the left hand of a man, "booming" has not been at all at any Olympic Games.
However, each participant could show how strong, bold, agile and clever he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in an open-air stage, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could do in inflatable attractions and get a new image in the faces make-up.
The novelty, which could also become a tradition, was a parade of vehicles, where both tractors and motorcycles went.
Everyone was addressed by Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, Head of Ķūļciems Parish Administration, who wished a nice rest and dry weather, however, the rain fell, but it could not disturb anything much.
The holiday continued with the greeting of the younger inhabitants of Ķūļciems.
It is really good that the parish has topped five girls and one boy.
With performances at Kūļciems residents were accompanied by amateur art collectives from Engure region - the audience very much liked the performances of the senior dance group "Autumn rhythms", dance performers of different nations "Redas" and youth dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's not that on the wet stage someone also happened to slip.
Of course, the famous autistic duo Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Krāniņa, as well as Bērzciems’s attractive wife from the fishing farm “Dieniņas” – was delighted.
The ball was played by the band "Cobble".
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only boost prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also across the country.
This, I think, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in London in 2012, where we put a huge amount of effort to get all regions in the country to benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and Eastend got a huge amount of the Olympics.
And we're going to do it again, providing locals and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs, and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Shiovan surroundings.
Just like at the London Olympics in 2012, this time there will be people who will believe that this challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
Back then, people said Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics during the Olympics and that it would be a global failure.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012 and also in the case of Heathrow they won't be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole of society, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a breeding ground for both employment and experience at the airport and across the UK.
Heathrow is working in a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion pounds, falling into time and budgeting with Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years to Terminal 2, which has been built between two more intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to set up a third runway that will be funded by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success and I am sure that there will be a expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow by securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Deiton is a board member of Heathrow and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Economics.
In Switzerland, a woman runs on the highway, trying to commit suicide.
The victim in the middle of the night lay down on the highway.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the incident when several cars were overpassed by several cars on the highway on Thursday early in the morning.
The incident happened on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morges in the Wall canton.
A vo-offen police report says that desperately wanting to commit suicide, the woman had slept on the road in the dark, where several cars drove her.
Unmistakably trying to kill himself, a victim, a 49-year-old Swiss, drove several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, while others have not yet been identified, say police, which is appealing for the involved drivers and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched in the case, which is a logical step in such a case, lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told Le Tribule de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds: "This will be cleared by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years suggest that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that in the middle of the night there would be a pedestrian on the highway, the newspaper reported.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted in the killing of negligence when she drove off a man who was lying on an A1 road near Payer in the middle of the night.
The court found out that the 22-year-old victim had drunk and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policeman, who was on his way to the accident site, drove in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was "completely unpredictable and exceptional."
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morgue is urged to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures are collected on the Internet for organising a new competition for the position of the SRS manager.
The collection of signatures for the competition of a new Head of the State Revenue Service (SRS) has been started on the petition portal "Avaaz.org".
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional process of nomination of officials.
The petition was established on August 10 and has been currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating the candidate for the position of the Director General of the SRS Inga Kolegova is opaque and unprofessional.
It recalls the best traditions of Soviet functionaries.
It discredits public administration and once again makes society disappoints the government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates should be judged," the petition's text says.
Its author Jānis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for the position chosen by Kolegova.
It is also not clear what the candidate’s intentions are in the work of the SRS.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new, open competition, in which professional candidates are actively addressed, recruiters are recruited and appropriate remuneration is offered.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Kolegova last week for the position of the head of the SRS, this week the government was intended to approve him in the new position, but all the ministers of the party "Vienotība" voted against, therefore the issue of a week was postponed.
Samoilovs: If we lost, so I played badly.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš have hoped for the award at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, without getting it, there is no difference in which to conclude the competition, Samoilovs said after withdrawing from the tournament.
One of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the sub-group tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to the Brazilians Evandra Gonsalvesh Oliveirs and Pedra Solberg Salgada, concluding his participation in the four-year major sports forum.
In three sub-group matches, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The small-point ratio between three couples was then counted, which after the convincing loss suffered in this match was the most unfavorable for the Latvian duo.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we stayed to 16 points", Smediņš remembered the game.
I don't even know how we stayed without points for the remainder of the set.
It can't play.
Then in the second set everything was fine and at the end of the set managed to break the game, and it should have been a good basis for the third set.
We started it similarly, but after we changed the parties, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all the teams were similar, in almost all matches there were three sets, so the small points were important.
"It was necessary to play more similarly, not to give up 3-4 points in a row several times," the athlete said.
We knew Evandra could be served.
"In the first set we got to cope with it, in the second we conceded 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already went to the game", remembered Šmēdiņš.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes it turned out, sometimes no.
I didn’t look at the overall assessment before the match, but it was known that we needed as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, so I played badly," Samoilov said.
We expected a good serve from Evandra and with it in the first sets we coped quite well, but in the third he opened a serve and it was difficult to build an attack.
I, on the other hand, made a lot of mistakes in my reception right on Pedru serve, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov told that contrary to the previous match today, the athletes had no nervousness.
"We went, we played, the defense was, but it was necessary to take a better serve", said the athlete.
"They played well and in the end already got on the "urrah"."
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw is the most uncomfortable as it could have been.
We had the chances of fighting for the first place, too, but we didn't even get out of the group.
"Everybody was waiting for a medal and we were waiting for a medal and we also have a difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilovs was already in the third Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 he competed with Mārtiņš Pļaviņš in Beijing, but four years ago he played together with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
This was the second start at the Olympics, for Smedia, meanwhile, for Smēdiņš.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market both from the position of the consumer and the potential trader, said the company's spokeswoman Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will be determined by what gas market model and legal framework will be established."
"Therefore, for our part, we are actively involved in the establishment and commenting of laws and regulations, as well as submit our proposals," Bidere said.
The agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (ME) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed the Cabinet of Ministers Regulations Project "Regulations on Trade and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the existing principles of natural gas market operation, ensuring the right to freely choose a natural gas trader for natural gas users as of 3 April 2017.
Working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the natural gas trade process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most effective and convenient service solution for the user, the "centric model of the trader" has been chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one place for the provision of information and customer service, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the operator of the distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
We remind that household users are expected to start the market - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who will not wish to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry informed.
In turn, merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader with which to enter into a natural gas trade contract.
Until the conclusion of a natural gas trade agreement, natural gas trade will be ensured by the current natural gas trader for a certain period of time for a certain period of time.
The draft Cabinet Regulations defines in detail the rights and obligations of a natural gas trader, system operator and users.
This Regulation prescribes the procedures by which natural gas shall be supplied to users and discontinue the supply thereof, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures by which the settlements for the services received, the amount of late payment interest, the procedures for changing traders and the supply of customers in the event of natural gas supply disruptions; the procedures by which the public trader shall ensure the supply of natural gas to the related users.

Minister: next week it is planned to judge the increase of remuneration of the Director General of the SRS.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS)) plans to talk to Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis (ZZS) and coalition partners of the government next week about increasing the remuneration of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Director General of the SRS should be urgently addressed in order to make this position more attractive to the potential candidates for the repeated competition.
Also, next week will talk about changing the terms of the competition.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of any particular candidate to address the vacant position.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Kolegova would have been a good Director General of the SRS.
With regard to the current SRS Chief Executive Officer Dace Pelēko, who has expressed her readiness to apply for this position, the Minister reiterated that the new Director General of the SRS should have a "view from the outside" and should not come from the structure of the SRS.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from the leave to advance the amendments to the law necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS as soon as possible.
The agency BNS has already announced that the Head of the State Environmental Service Inga Kolegova has submitted an application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS) in which she revokes her candidacy for the position of Director General of the SRS.
In the submission, she expressed that this is not an easy choice, but over the past two weeks, her loved ones have undergone serious emotional pressure, although they have not taken any law-reprehensible actions.
Kolegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions among the parties of the ruling coalition, which is also unacceptable.
It is also reported that the previous Director General of the SRS Ināra Pētersone left her post at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to climb; stock indexes in the US and Europe are rising, as well as the value of the US dollar.
Global oil prices continue to rise on Friday morning, with investor sentiment positively affected by Saudi Arabia's Oil Affairs Minister's statements, which reinforce expectations that the largest oil-winning nations will take action at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the global oil market.
The three main U.S. stock indexes on Thursday reached record levels that had not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in the oil price and strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday was also the reason for the rise in European stock indexes.
The value of the US dollar rose against the euro on Thursday, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the price of WTI-branded crude oil for deliveries in September rose by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel on Thursday.
The price of Brent crude oil for deliveries on the London Stock Exchange increased by $1.99 to $46.04 per barrel in October.
The turnover of the canned food producer "Zilā lagūna" last year shrank by 33.8%.
The turnover of the canned food producer "Zilā lagūna" last year was 4.202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the database "Lursoft".
According to the company’s management report, in 2015 the company was operating at a loss due to several reasons, including due to the constant lack of working capital caused by the departure of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, interrupting the previously existing credit line, and leaving the "Zilo lagūna" with concluded contracts without the possibility to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large volumes and receive a volume discount.
The departure of the bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing the European Union Structural Funds support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial indicators in the last year were negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the unwillingness of customers to pay more than the company’s manufactured goods.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - highest - prices", says the company's management.
Also in 2015, "Zilā lagūna" started negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and real estate.
Investors have already been to the company's largest creditor Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have got to know and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which allows to achieve greater productivity and capacity of production.
"A number of equipment were purchased that provide a higher production rate," the company's management said.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the purchased equipment in 2016 will allow the company's production unit to fulfill such orders that were not possible so far.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
As the intent protocols on the sale of the product has already been signed, all produced will be sold according to the letter of intent.
The new product will increase its turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", says the company's management.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, "Blue Lagoon" has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the outlet to Cyprus and this year will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US in September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Zila lagūna" worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and a loss of 5.113 million euros.
"Zilā lagūna" was founded in 1997 and its share capital is 1.156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igors Širšons (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 at the museum to greet the film diva Zāra Leander and participate in a press conference.
Riga can be considered the beginning of the career of the sonorous cinema diva Zāra Leandere and the city of inspiration.
The visit of the godmother Ruta, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned out to be fateful in Riga in 1924, because it was she who discovered the unusual low-gross of the woman of Zara Leandere, which she tried to make her debut on the stage of the Riga Cabare Theatre.
Perhaps it was the random sense in Riga that became the fateful turn in the Sarah's creative path towards the fame of the world.
Riga was associated with warm memories for the Riga, and she hoped to come to Riga for guest performances, but unfortunately these hopes were not destined to be fulfilled, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible during the Riga City Festival 2016 and the great Great Ieva Kerēvica will play the role of the outstanding Sara Leandere.
There are widespread traffic restrictions in the Aglona neighborhood.
To ensure the safety of the Celebrations of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the Assumption of Heaven, starting from 12 August at. 17.00 to 15 August at 17.00. At 18.00, the transit traffic of a truck on several state roads in the vicinity of Aglona will be closed, VAS Latvijas Valsts ceļi informed.

For other road users, traffic will be provided along the bypass road - a scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants arrive at this festival, including pilgrims.
Therefore, motorists should be especially careful, because on different road routes towards Aglona there will be intensive pedestrian movement.
We invite drivers to treat the traffic restrictions introduced with understanding, to follow the traffic organization procedure, as well as to take into account possible longer time spent on the road.

Officials say the demonstration was generally peaceful and the protesters, at the request of the staff, have voluntarily left the building.
The insurer pays compensation to passengers on Wednesday at the airport's canceled flight.
If Insurance has paid a travel insurance indemnity to a family for the flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, which resulted in the abandonment of the planned music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance from a customer received a claim application.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible for the airport on Wednesday due to the cancellation flights at the airport, the customer was calculated for the reservation of accommodation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the purchased festival tickets in the amount of 204 euros.
In turn, the airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money spent on plane tickets.
If Insurance from all travel insurance indemnities on average in 15% of cases has paid compensation for travel interruption or cancellation.
"At these times, expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets are reimbursed, as well as for the reservation of the accommodation," says Dagnija Rutka, Head of the Insurance Persons Risk Insurance Product.
As it is known, on the evening of 10 August, a private aircraft stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical problems, therefore several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.
Due to the repair of the neighbor, the man gets crushed ceilings and forced to leave the home.
Dmitrijs Saidjaševs, whose neighbour has started to overhaul in his apartment, turned to the LTV broadcast "Studija 4", and since then Dmitry has been treated from the ceiling and there is no certainty that it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and there is a damaged ceiling in my apartment.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the house manager and other organizations.
The building board said we are not an operational service and we don't have any expert.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and from there there will be an expert," Dmitry says.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what happened and admitted that the cover was in an unsatisfactory state.
However, since the first application of Dmitry to the building authority, a month has passed, and by the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether being in the apartment is not life-threatening.
The building board said - such is legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house to the manager, then the house manager again to the construction board, and then there is a dead end," says Dmitrijs.
After examining the entire pile of papers, it is clear that the construction works have been stopped, although it can be heard from time to time that someone is working there.
Within two months, an expert-examination must be carried out and within six months the apartment owner, who performs repairs, has to eliminate all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up its opinion, but the building authority considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this load-bearing structure has been affected, therefore it is not certain that the owner of the lower apartment is endangered.
"Therefore, we have requested additional explanation from this expert," says Ilze Žūka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there it is still audible that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a construction permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in the particular case the penalty may be much more severe.
While the expert opinion is awaited, the building authority has taken a decision that both apartments should not be operated - both in which construction works and Dmitry apartment are taking place.
"This is an unprecedented case in the construction board's practice, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply reluctance, residents may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the building authority.
Now it remains for Dmitry to look for another place to live - to relatives, friends, hotel or to rent another apartment.
But the resulting loss Dmitry can try to recover from a neighbour in a civil law, which can take a lot of time.
Due to arbitrary construction, staying in both apartments is currently prohibited until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, and it may have to wait even three weeks.
The damage will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment where the repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment, because the construction board has not taken into account the statement, is also threatened with imprisonment for a period of up to six months.
Guess!

The transformation of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, Gita Želve, representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri", tells LETA.
The hotel is the first stage for the restoration of the former sanitation of Ķemeri.
The second stage will be a "wellness" or wellness clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
But she points out that it will be located in the former building of the resort of the former resort of the former building, with an area of about 12 000 square meters.
The clinic will be stationed on three floors.

By mid-2017, design works are planned, but construction works and landscaping works will start in the autumn of next year.
As reported, in the historical sanatorium complex "Ķemeri" it is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction protracted.
In turn, the annual report for 2010 it was still claimed that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to ensure daily technical control in the sanatorium "Ķemeri", and already in 2011 the "reconstruction of the future hotel "Kemeri" will be completed" and the preparatory work for the opening of the "Kempinski" chain hotel will begin immediately.
In October 2014, the total belongings of the Kemeri sanatorium owned by the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" were confirmed by "Park Hotel Ķemeri" at auction, but a month later the auction was recognized as not having taken place, because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was set at the starting price of the last auction, EUR 2.86 million.
As LETA was informed by the representative of the City Council Ieva Aile, the local government, by signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the co-financing of the European Union structural funds the adjacent infrastructure will be arranged - the historic Ķemeri Park will be restored, an interactive nature tourism object will be created, roads and parking lots will be arranged.

The Russian hacker has hacked an email from former NATO commander Brīdlova.
Hackers who hacked U.S. Democrats' National Committee (DNC) computers allegedly carried out a number of other cyberattacks, also hacked email by NATO's European Force former commander Philippe Bredlow and George Soros Institute's Open Society servers, business news agency Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
Hackers posted the information on the website "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, there is also Bredwlow's correspondence and news about the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the institute's computers were available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks have been carried out by the same hackers associated with the Russian special services who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to introduce sanctions, the administration will have an official cyberattack on Democratic Party servers to be accused by Russia or hackers supported by Russian authorities.
As reported, the website "WikiLeaks" in July released about 20,000 emails obtained from the DNC's computer system, meaning that Democratic Party leaders tried to harm the campaign of the party's candidate Hillary Clinton's former rival Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the fight for the launch of the Democratic nomination in the presidential election.
As reported by US press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation of Democrats' servers, as well as other U.S. special services, believe Russia's connection to the cyberattack is almost unquestionable.
McCarthy: The presence of Joko Ono threatened "The Beatles."
Paul McCartney acknowledged that the presence of Yoko Ono has created a sense of threat from the legendary band "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star is currently maintaining a "good" relationship with the widow of late John Lennon, but at a time she went to visit the band in a recording studio, MacCartney was frightened by MacCartney because Ono was the only woman between the band members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When asked the singer about the relationship between the two, he replied to the magazine "Rolling Stone": "They are truly good."
We felt at risk at the time.
While we recorded, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate it.
We were able to do it, but not very successful, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to the recording studio, they allowed us to run.
When John started dating Joko, she didn't sit in a control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of the graduation "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he is now regularly in contact with former bandi-member Ringo, and occasionally confirms the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but in any other way "The Beatles" has "lasted to operate".
Asked if he still meets the other alone still living apart by a member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often no."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to the meetings, I feel a little disassociated from it.
I left Apple during a hard divorce.
I sent John Eastman in my place to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful as if to see the dying of my pet.
The company is now working so that I'm just listening to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus once been a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists at the NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, the surface of which is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, have once been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously made it guess that Venus' slow speed of rotation is explained by the dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus's earlier topography.
There have been more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it, so that life can be formed and prevented from evaporating water.
In the early years of Venus, the Sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the spin pattern of Venus reveals that the bright part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explained GIS scientist Antonija Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds, acting as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the Sun.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is formed, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in its hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, over the course of billions of years Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet rays.
They effervesered by the oceans, and the spirits were burned out by ultraviolet rays.
When the water was completely evaporated, only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas remained - Venus as we know it today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice-president of hockey operations Patrick Roy filed a resignation, citing the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
The vice president and general manager of the Colorado, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and informed that the club will immediately begin to look for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been vigorously, enthusiastic and purposefully performing my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado club's hockey operations," 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
During this summer, I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team to give it the perfection and achieve higher-level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and vice president of hockey operations must fully coincide with the visions of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Sakis, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him today about his decision.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was named the league's best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the playoffs, the Colorado team was beaten by the Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club hasn't entered the playoffs for two years.
Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team, without getting the second special invitation of the Western Conference organizers.
The Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and postpone strike
Staff strikes on the remuneration of North Sea oil platform workers have been postponed as both parties to the dispute resumed talks, talks said.
Periodically, the oil processing company "Wood Group" is holding strikes on the North Sea oil equities operating the Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement said that the Wood Group and Unite and the MRM unions have agreed to resume negotiations on resolving the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are scheduled to start early next week with the aim of re-examining issues.
The unions said their recent events, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are against the planned wage cut of 30 per cent.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group cut salaries for workers in the North Sea this year by 9 percent.
Already in 2014, the company cut the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
In turn, Shell already cut wages of several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas in 10 countries to optimize its work in preparing for a large-scale merger deal with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are feeling pressure due to falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier in the week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea is vital for the economy of the region.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, not individual individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to invest nearly $1.4 billion, compared with $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Keplers size star spin speed in the constellation of Pleiades.
The mission of the latest Kepler telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalog of star rotation speed in the constellation of Plyad.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation are spinning at different speeds, as well as how the rotational speed of stars refers to planetary formation.
"We hope that comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the connection between the star mass, age and even the history of its solar system," the Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center scientist Luisa Rebula told reporters in a news release.
The constellation of Plyad is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are only beginning to rise, reaching the age of about 125 million.
They shall rotate at the maximum speed.
Turning at the maximum speed, these growing stars give off a large amount of star wind.
When the winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their spin speed decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable star area, such as solar spots.
The latest star spin speed directory suggests that larger stars spin slower than smaller stars.
Rebull compares stars with dancers, larger dancers make pirouettes more slowly than small dancers.
Rebuls tells that the "ballet" of Pleiades shows that the slow rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the constellation of Pleiades is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of the stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebuls tells that the constellation of Pleiades helps to create theoretical models of star rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of star rotation slows down and the process of stopping for it.
Rebull and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of the stars of Pleiades in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
