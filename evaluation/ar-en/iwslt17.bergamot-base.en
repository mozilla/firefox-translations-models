Well, that's a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybekzynski.
She is a scientist in ancient fossils, which means she specializes in digging up very old dead creatures.
Natalia Rybekzinski: Yes, there are those who call me "Doctor of Dead Beings."
Latif Nasser: I think it’s particularly interesting because of the places to dig to look for these things, towards the top of the Arctic Circle in the far Canadian tundra.
On a summer of 2006, it was at a drilling site called the "camel shrine", which is located at less than 10 degrees from the latitude away from the attractive Arctic.
Natalia: Really, it won’t sound very exciting, because you spend the whole day walking around with your backpack, GPS and notebook and picking up anything that might look like a fossil.
N: At some location, I noticed something.
Natalia: Something rusty, kind of rusty, the size of the palm of my hand.
She was lying on the roof.
Latif Nasser: I initially thought it was just a fragment of wood, because such things were found in that place before-- plant parts from prehistoric times.
But that night, on the way back to the camp...
Natalia: ... I took out the lens of the hand, carefully scrutinized it and realized that it did not carry the traces of tree rings.
Maybe something that's been carefully preserved, but it's really like...
The bones.
Natif Nasser: Over the next four years, I went to the site over and over again, and eventually collected 30 fragments of the same bones, most of which are really small.
Natalia: Not a big group. She can have a little Ziplock bag.
Nasser Latif: And I tried to put them together like a puzzle of the cut-off pictures.
But it was a challenge.
Natalia: She was smashed into several small pieces, tried to use sand and putty, but it didn’t look good.
Eventually, we used a 3D scanner.
Cute Nasser: Oh! Natalia: Right?
N: It turns out that doing this by default is the easiest way.
Natalia: It's kind of magic when it fits together.
How confident you were doing it right, that you collected it right?
Is there a possibility to bring it together in another way and get Barraket, for example?
Natalia: No. No, we got this.
Latif Nasser: What I got, I found out, it was the tibia, the tibia, the leg bone, specifically, belonging to the family of mammals with a holof, something that resembles a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been one of them.
It was so big.
Natalia: The size of this thing was enormous, it was a large animal.
N.: Which animal can be?
She introduced one of the fragments to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea of it.
Natalia: We took a saw, we made a hole in it, and it smelled interesting.
Latif Nasser: It smelled like burnt flesh.
It was a smell that Natalia knew by cutting skulls in the anatomy laboratory: collagen.
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.
Usually, after many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic was like a natural refrigerator and it was preserved.
But a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she met a colleague named Mike Buckley who was explaining a new operation called the “collagen fingerprint.”
It turns out that different varieties have structures of collagen are slightly different, if you get a collagen composition from unknown bones, you can compare it with known varieties, and who knows, you may get a match.
So she sent one of them to him, FedEx.
Natalia: Yes, you want to follow that. It's kind of important.
. Nasser: He treated them, and compared them with 37 known species of our time.
And he got a match.
The 3.5 million-year-old bone found by Natalia from the Upper Arctic region has been shown to be due to...
Camel.
Natalia: And come to me, what? This is amazing -- if it's true.
L: They examined all the fragments, and they got the same result.
However, based on the size of the bones discovered, this means that these camels are 30 percent larger than the beauty found in modern times.
This camel will be about 9 feet long, weighing about half a ton.
Yes,
Natalia found a giant camel from the Arctic.
Now, when you hear the word ‘camel’, what may come to mind is one of those, the hump-humped camels from the Middle East and Central Asia.
But the chances that the picture in your mind is that of one of these, the only camel, the intrinsic desert creature — expands in hot sandy places like the Middle East and the desert, on its back, an old, large-sized hump to store water for long desert trips, has big feet and wide to help it climb the sand dunes.
So how did one of them end up here in the Upper Arctic?
Well, scientists have long known, as it turned out, even before the discovery of Natalia, that beauty is actually of American origin.
They first appeared here.
For about 40 of the 45 million years, beauty has been around, and it can be found in North America only, about 20 different species, and perhaps more.
Natalia: If you put it in a group, would it look different?
Cute Nasser: Yes, you will have different sizes.
Some of them will have a very long neck, so they actually look like a giraffe.
Latif Nasser: For some nose, like crocodiles.
Natalia: The primitive ones, they were already small, almost like rabbits.
Latif Nasser: What? Beauty the size of a rabbit?
Natalia: The old ones.
So you won't be able to recognize her perhaps.
N: Oh, my God, I want a pet camel-rabbish.
I know, wouldn't that be great?
Latif Nasser: About three or seven million years ago, a group of camels headed towards South America, where it became Lama and Albaka, and another group crossed the land bridge of Bernigia towards Asia and Africa.
Then, before the end of the last Ice Age, beauty became extinct in North America.
Scientists have already known all of this, but it is still difficult to explain how Natalia found one in the far north.
Low temperature, pole opposite the desert.
To be fair now, three and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, warmer than it is now.
Northern forests, more like the Yukon or Siberian today.
But still, like, the winter will be six months long as the water ponds freeze.
There may be snowstorms.
The night lasts for 24 hours in a row.
Like, how is that... How?
How did one of the desert stars manage to survive in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues thought they had the answer.
Which is kind of cool.
What if the features we imagine make the camel adapt in places like the desert, actually evolved to help it weather the winter?
What if he wasn't supposed to set foot on the sand, but the snow, like skate boots?
What if that hump was -- and it was a surprise to me, it doesn't have water, it has fat -- it's there to help the camels cope with the six winter months. When is the food scarce?
And then, long after she crossed the bridge, did she adjust the features of winter to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, a hump may be good for beauty in hot climates because all the fat is in one place, such as a fat backpack, which means you don’t need all this insulation material in the rest of the body.
So it helps to dissipate heat easier.
This is a crazy idea, which seems to be proof that the ideal nature of the desert could be evidence of the ancient Arctic.
I'm not the right person to tell you this story.
Others said it was a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or a future key to climate change.
But I like it for completely different reasons.
For me, this story is about us, about how we see the world and how that changes.
I received training as a date.
And I knew that, in fact, a lot of historians, too.
They made sense of the past.
You tell us the history of the universe and the planet we live in.
As a historian, you start with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
Natalia: We make up stories and stick to them, like camels in the desert, right?
That's a great story! You're perfectly adapted to it.
She clearly lived there forever.
Nasser: But at any moment, some evidence can be discovered.
Learning some little things can force you to reframe everything you think you know.
Like, in this case, a scientist found one piece of what I thought was wood, and because of that, science has a completely new theory and is completely contrary to what this creature looks like the way it is.
And for me, it totally turned that on the way I think about sentences.
Turned from a fucking creature suitable only for one specific environment, to be a traveler in the world that happened to be present in the desert, could end up almost anywhere.
I give you Azuri.
Azuri, hi. How are you?
Okay, here, I got one of these you.
Azuri enjoys a break from his normal inconvenience in the music hall of Radio City.
It's not just a joke.
Anyway -- but, Azuri is among us as a living reminder that the story of our world is lively.
It requires preparation for tuning, and usually imagination.
Isn't it, Azuri?
And that we're only a little bit away from seeing the world in a new way.
Thank you so much.
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how bad they are.
I would like to tell you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
I would first take you back to a cold night in the 2011 neighborhood that had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting in a local bar outside of Colomeba University. Where I studied computer science and neuroscience, I was with a fellow student in the middle of an interesting conversation about the ability of holographs to replace computers one day.
And while we were going to get to the most interesting part of the conversation, of course, his treads lighted up.
He pulled it towards him and looked at him and started printing.
And then he started forcing his eyes to look at me and he was like, "I'm full of focus."
But of course his eyes were attached to the tamp, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar I noticed another student holding his phone. This time he was with a group.
He was browsing photos on Instagram, and those boys were laughing hysterically.
And this duality between my miserable feeling and their feeling of happiness about the same technology. You made me think.
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the negative factor in the equation wasn't the digital information, it was simply the position of the screen that was separating me from my friend and was bringing those kids together.
As you can see, they were gathered around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social norms telling stories about the campfire.
And that's exactly the role of tools, I think.
Their role lies in extending the capabilities of our bodies.
And I think computers today are doing the opposite.
Whether you’re sending an email to your spouse, writing a music, or consoling a friend, you’re doing it almost the same way.
You bend over those rectangles, you press the buttons and menus and more rectangles.
And it occurred to me that this is the wrong way, I think we could use a machine that is closer to nature.
We have to use machines that get our work back on the ground.
We have to use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our perceptions rather than reduce them.
The circumstances made it to have such a machine with me.
It's called metas 2.
Let's try it.
I see the audience right in front of me, and I see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we're going to see a spectral image, a very realistic spectral image that appears in front of me, in front of these glasses that I'm wearing right now.
And this can be anything to shop for or learn from, and I can use my hands and move them easily.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll be back in a minute.
Now, if you're like me, your mind must be reeling from the possibilities of what this technology will allow us to do, to look at some of it.
My mother is an architect, so naturally, the first thing I imagined was to extend a building in a three-dimensional space instead of using these two-dimensional charts.
She touches the drawings at the moment and chooses the interior decor.
All of this was filmed on GoPro through our own glasses.
This second use is special to me, it's the professor's project of a glass brain representation, thanks to the University of California, San Francisco.
As a neuroscience student, I always dream of being able to learn and memorize all these complex brain structures with a real machine that enables me to touch and manipulate the various brain structures.
What you're seeing is called augmented reality, but for me it's about a more complex story -- the story of how we can stretch our body's capabilities with digital devices rather than do the opposite.
Now...
I think that in the next few years, humanity will go through a transformation.
We're going to start putting a whole layer of digital information on the ground.
Imagine for a moment what this might mean for novelists, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior designers, and perhaps for all present today.
And what I think we need to do as a community. It is to try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of making our reality as a game or the scattering of digital information in it.
And that's my passion.
I want to share a little secret with you.
After five years -- this is not the smallest of the devices -- after about five years, they'll all look like glass tapes on our eyes showing spectral images.
And we don't care about any gastrometers that we buy in terms of hardware -- we buy it because of the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of making a mental operating system.
And it's important to do it the right way, because we've probably lived inside these things at least for the rest of our lives with the graphical interface of Windows.
And I don't know about you, but living on Windows freaks me out.
To isolate the most famous facade from infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design principles instead of letting a group of designers fight around it in the meeting room.
The principle we all aspire to is called the "less resistant neural pathway."
At every turn, we connect the mental operating system with our mind for the first time in the specificities of our brains.
We're trying to build an easy-to-use computer.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
These are the first three design principles we employ in this new user experience.
The first and most important principle is that you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract. It takes your brain to work harder to decipher it.
It works against the less resistant neural pathway.
Whereas in augmented reality, you can, of course, put the spectral image of the TED platform here, and the spectral image of your email on this side of the office, and your local memory has evolved to allow it to be found.
You can put the Tesla model you want to buy -- or whatever my legal team asked me to put in before the show.
Great. Your brain knows exactly how to recover it.
The second principle is called “touching to see.”
What do kids do when they see something that interests them?
They try to reach him and touch him.
And that's exactly how the normal machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense that we call deep-sense reception -- it's the sense of perception of internal organs.
So by touching our work directly, we will not only be able to control it better, but we will also understand it more deeply.
From it came the idea of "touching to see."
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
We are social primaries.
Which brings me to the third principle, the holographic campfire from our first story.
Our mirror neuron cell suggests that we can communicate better with each other and with our work if we can see each other's faces and hands in three dimensions.
If you look at the video behind me, you see the users of a Meta device playing in the same spectral image, communicating with the eyes, connected around this thing, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's try this again with the neuroscience taking into account.
So, our preferred operating system, the mindset.
I'm going to take a step further and take these glasses and leave them here by the office.
I'm here with you at the moment, we're in touch.
My positional memory does and I can take it and bring it to me, so it reminds me that I am the occupancy system.
And my deep sense of reception is working, and I can blow these glasses into millions of pieces and touch the sensor that's now wiping my handprint.
But seeing things alone isn't enough, and after a second my partner's gonna make a three-dimensional call--?
How are things?
I can see it in front of me in three dimensions.
And he's very realistic.
Thank you.
This will replace the huddens according to the mirror neuron cell in the not too distant future.
How are things?
Great: We're on the direct.
: , I give the audience the gift of the spectral brain that we saw in the video above.
This will not only change the hataves, but also the way we cooperate.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
: You're welcome.
This is the message that was discovered in that bar in 2011. The future of computers is not in one of these screens.
He's here, inside of us all.
If there’s one idea I want to put to you, it’s that the natural machine is not a fantasy of the future, it’s here in 2016.
That's why all 100 people at Meta, including the management team, executives, designers and engineers -- and before the TED2017 conference, we're going to throw out our computer screens and replace them with a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thank you, everyone.
Tell me one thing. Because I’ve made a few demos on augmented reality over the past year almost.
There is a debate among technological experts. Are we really seeing something real on the screen?
There's a matter of the field of vision, in the way that technology shows us a broader view than you can see through the glasses.
Was what we saw real?
Certainly.
Not only that, but we took extra precautions to shoot it through the lenses with the GoPro camera in the various shots we saw.
We want to simulate the real experience that we see through the glasses, without any tricks.
Thank you for showing us that. I appreciate it, thank you very much.
I'm one of the most liberal, tolerant, and advanced spots in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great family from Seattle.
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor. I am truly grateful to them for raising me, because I have always felt completely comfortable in planning my life perfectly in a way that suits me.
As a matter of fact, I took a path other than the one my parents were planning.
When I was 19, I left college -- I left, I got kicked out, say what you want.
Then I took a career as a professional in playing the French trump that was my life’s dream.
I played theatrical music all over America and Europe, and I wandered for a few years with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd.
At the end of my 20s, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a great life.
And you know, my parents never complained.
They supported me through my path.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, on a decade-long break."
And-- and yet there was a very difficult conversation about my lifestyle that I'd like to tell you.
I was 27, I was coming home from Barcelona, I visited my father for Christmas, I was cooking dinner with my mom and we were alone in the kitchen.
It was quiet, very quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
And I said, "What?" I mean, what is it, now?
She said, “I want you to be completely honest with me: Were you voting for Republicans?”
Well, the truth is, I wasn't a politician, I was just a French trummer.
But I was fond of the discoveries, and they had revealed it, and it was caused by some confusion.
As you can see, I was passionate about capitalism, I want to tell you why it was.
It seems that of my constant interest, believe it or not, in poverty.
You see, when I was a kid, and I grew up in Seattle, I remember the first time, I saw a real poverty.
We were a sub-middle family, but that is, of course, not a real poverty.
That's never close.
The first time I saw poverty, the face of poverty, when I was six or seven years old, the early 1970s.
It was like many of you, an irregular example, vulgar.
It was a picture in the National Geographic Journal of a child my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a swollen belly.
He would not have escaped his inevitable fate, I was aware of it but I couldn't do anything.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, but any picture like it.
I have provided the West with acute poverty that exists around the world.
Well, that vision followed me until I grew up and went to school and I went out and I went back to it and started making up my family.
I wondered, what happened to that kid?
Or people like him around the world?
And I started studying, even though I wasn't in school, I was looking for the answer: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Did they get worse? Did you get better? Or what?
And I found the answer, and I've changed my life, and I want to share that with you.
As you can see -- most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse than it has been since we were children, since they've seen that vision.
If you ask Americans, “Has poverty around the world gotten worse or better?” 70% of people will answer that hunger has worsened since early 1970.
But that's the truth.
That's the discovery that changed my mind.
From 1970 to now, the proportion of the world's population living in hunger levels lives on a dollar or less a day, of course, with the necessary adjustment to calculate inflation, this percentage has decreased by 80 percent.
There has been an 80% reduction in the worst poverty in the world since I was a child.
And I didn't even know that.
My friends, this is a miracle.
This is something we should celebrate.
It is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in the history of humanity, and it has happened in our lives.
When I knew that, I wondered what enabled us to do it, and how it became possible.
If you don't know why, you won't be able to do it again.
If you want to do it again and get two billion people out of poverty, that's what we've been talking about since I was a kid, at least two billion of these people, our brothers and sisters, who were taken out of poverty.
I want two more billion, so I wanted to know why.
I started looking for the answer.
It wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from the left-right and center economists.
And here we are.
Those are the reasons.
These are 5 reasons to get 2 billion of our brothers and sisters out of poverty since I was a child.
First, globalization.
Second, free trade.
Third, property rights.
Fourth, the rule of law.
Fifth, the creation of projects.
This was due to the system of free economy that spread around the world after 1970.
Right now, I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect, I know that free enterprises are not all we need to build a better world.
But that's great.
Beyond politics.
That's what I've learned. That's what I found out.
Capitalism is not just accumulation.
Because it's at its best, it's ambitious, which is what a lot of people on this platform are talking about, the ambition that comes from dreams and it's an integral part of the free economy system.
We have to share it with more people.
Now, I want to share with you a second discovery that is linked to the first discovery, which I believe will contribute to evolution not only around the world, but here at home.
The best quote I have heard to summarize the ideas I just told you about lifting people out of poverty is this: “Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
I have brought billions of people out of poverty.”
Who said that?
Looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
This is wrong.
President Barack Obama said that.
Why do I know that by heart?
Because he told me that.
Crazy.
And I said, "Halleloya."
But more than that, I said, "What a chance."
You know what I was thinking?
It was during an event we were doing about it at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought, that's the solution to the big problem that America is facing today. What?
It revolves around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help the people who need us most.
Right now, I won't have to tell anyone in this room that we're in crisis, in America and many countries around the world about political polarization.
It has risen to critical crisis levels.
This is not pleasant and not true.
There was an article last year in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious newspapers published in the West.
An article published in 2014 on the inconsistency of political action.
This is what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your faith is based on love but your opponent’s doctrine is based on hatred.
This is common in the global conflict.
This is expected to be seen among the Palestinians and the Israelis, for example.
What this article found was in America today, and most Republicans and Democrats suffer from political inconsistency.
The majority of people today who are politically active in our country believe that they are moving out of love, while the other side is motivated by hatred.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, "You know, my faith is based on empathy, I want to help people, but other people are evil and they're on the lookout for me."
You can't evolve as a society when you're experiencing this kind of inconsistency.
That's impossible.
How do we find a solution to this?
Okay, first, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not underestimate the differences. That would be some kind of naivety.
There is a lot of good research on this.
One of TED's lecturers is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a psychologist at New York University.
He studies the faith, values, and ethics of several people to discover how they differ.
It has proven, for example, that conservatives and liberals have different importance in what they believe to be important.
For example, John Heiddett has proven that liberals are 59 percent more concerned with poverty than with economic freedom.
Conservatives are 28 percent more interested in economic freedom than they are about poverty.
Contradictory differences, right?
We will never agree. Wrong.
This is the diversity in which our strength lies.
You remember what brought the poor out of their poverty.
That obsession with poverty was linked to the way of economic freedom that spread around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and get two billion more out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Hmm.
How are we gonna do that?
It's confusing, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
A lot of it on this platform.
Create social projects, yes. Of course. Distinctive.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, ethical and responsible way. Yeah, yeah.
But you know what we really need?
We need a new day with a flexible ideology.
We should be less predictable.
Isn't it?
Do you feel like your faith is beginning to become predictable?
Kind of traditional?
Do you always feel like you're listening to people who agree with you?
Why would that be dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the Imben, on the conservatives, you're always talking about taxes, the laws, the big government.
On the left, the Liberals, you talk about economics, it’s always about income inequality.
These things are important now, very important to me. Very important to you.
But when it comes to saving people who are starving to need us, these will distract from them.
We need to come together and agree on the best way to alleviate poverty using the best of our own, and this can be achieved when the Conservatives recognize their need for liberals, their obsession with poverty, and the need of liberals for conservatives and their obsession with free trade.
This is the diversity where the future strength of this country lies, if we choose it.
So how are we gonna do that, how do we do it together?
I've got some business rules, not just you, but me too.
First. The first rule: Remember, it’s not good enough to tolerate those who disagree with you.
That's not good enough.
We must remember that we need different people with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these means.
Now, what are you going to do, and how are you going to express that?
Where does this start?
You know, we're all in this room now, blessed.
We are blessed with the people who hear us.
We are blessed with luxury. We are blessed with leadership.
When others hear us, with this kind of unexpected ideology, people can listen.
Maybe you can move on to that point.
That's number one. Number two.
Number Two: I ask you and I ask myself to be that person who crosses the barriers, the mysterious person, who is difficult to classify.
If you're a conservative, be someone who's always a conservative who's always about poverty and the moral duty to be a fight against poverty.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always speaks about the beauty of free markets to address our problems when used responsibly.
If we do that, we'll have two things.
First, we should start working on the next two billion and be the solution that we have seen so much in the past and need to see more of it in the future. That's what it's gonna be.
Second, we may be able to change the terrible and sacred ideological war we are experiencing in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, maybe, just maybe, we'll realize that our biggest difference is not really that different.
Thank you.
When I was in college... My specialty was in government work, which means I have to write a lot of papers.
Now when any ordinary student writes a paper, his work schedule looks almost like this.
As you can see... At first, work is slow, but you get done during the first week enough to make you see the heavy days coming look productive and nice.
And I wish I could do it the same way.
That's how the plan will be.
I'll start writing the schedule to get started, and then it's time to write. And I end up like this!
This happens in every paper I write.
Until he asked me to write a 90-page graduation thesis, a paper we're supposed to be working on all year!
And for a paper like this, my usual schedule wasn't an option.
Because the project was so big.
I started planning the project, and I decided that the schedule should look like something like this.
That's how the year goes.
I'm going to start with the easy and light work, then I'll increase the effort a little in the middle of the year, and at the end of the year I'll work as hard as I can. It'll be as easy as climbing the ladder, a degree.
How hard can climbing stairs?
It's not a big deal, right?
But the funniest thing happened to me.
In the first months,
She came and went fast, and I couldn't do anything.
I decided to change my plan a little bit.
Then... But in fact, the middle of the year went by so fast, and I didn't write a word. Now I'm here!
Reduce the two months for one month. Then to two weeks.
One day I woke up, and there were only three days left to deliver! And I haven't written a word yet, so I've done the only thing I can do, I've written 90 pages in 72 hours, and I've been on two full days without sleep. And humans should not stay up late for two days without sleep, running to university, in slow motion handed the paper exactly on schedule!
I thought I got everything done.
A week later, I got a call, it was a call from the university.
They asked, "Are you Tim Orben?"
And she said, "Yes."
They said, "We should discuss with you about your thesis."
I said, "Okay."
They said... “It’s the best thesis we’ve ever seen.”
That didn't really happen,
It was a very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
No, no, it was too bad.
Anyway, today I am a writer and blogger on the Internet.
I write in a blog called "Wait, but why?"
Two years ago, I decided to write about procrastination and postponement.
My actions always puzzled the non-procrators around me and why I postponed my deeds, so I wanted to explain to them and to the world, what is going on in the heads of those who do and postpone their work, and why we are like this.
I had a theory that the minds of procrators are really different from other people.
And to test this, I found a lab that allowed me to use an MRI machine to scan another man's brain that wouldn't delay his work so I could compare them, and I could use an MRI machine to scan for a brain image and another man's brains that wouldn't delay his work so I
And I brought the pictures with me to see them today by yourself,
Now I want you to take a closer look to see if there's a difference.
I know you're not all experts, and it's not clear, but just look, okay?
So here's the picture of the brain that doesn't put off,
And now...
Here's a picture of my brain.
There's a difference.
Both minds contain, but the procasin's mind also contains
Now, what does that mean for the procrastinator?
It means everything's fine until this happens.
Man: "This is the perfect time to get the work done" Monkey: "No!" He will do something useful and productive. But the monkey doesn't like the plan, and the monkey takes the wheel and says, "Why don't we read the whole Wikipedia page about the Nancy and Tonya scandal because I just remembered that this happened!"
Then... Then we'll go to the fridge and see if anything changes in it 10 minutes ago.
After that, we're going to go into the YouTube spiral that starts with videos about Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ending after a very long time with watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
The monkey: “All this will take time, and there is no room to do anything today.
Sorry!
Now, what's going on here?
This monkey doesn't look like someone you want to be a leader behind the rudder.
He's living completely in the present moment,
He has no memory of the past and no knowledge of the future. He only cares about two things: "Easy and fun."
In the animal world, this is perfectly.
If you are a dog, and you do nothing but easy and fun, you are successful by all accounts!
And for monkeys, humans are just another species of animal.
They eat, sleep and multiply. This will be normal in primitive times.
But if you don't notice, we're not in those times.
We are in a sophisticated and civilized time and the monkey does not know the meaning of it.
And that's why it's in our head, which gives us abilities that no other animal can do,
We can imagine the future,
We can see the whole picture.
We can make long-term plans.
The decision-maker takes all this into account,
And he wants us to do just what seems right and logical to do now.
Sometimes doing something makes sense and fun at the same time, like attending a dinner, going to sleep, or having fun in free time.
That's why there's an overlap between logic and fun.
Sometimes they get along,
At other times, it makes more sense to work on something that is difficult and unpleasant for the greater benefit.
Here the conflict occurs.
For the procrason, this conflict always ends in the same way, making him spend most of his time in the orange zone, a pleasant, easy and completely separate from the circle of logic.
I call it.
Now, a place you all know, you procrastinators well.
A place where leisure activities occur at a time that is not really free time.
The fun you have in is not real fun, because it is completely unworthy and the atmosphere around you is filled with guilt, unhappiness, anxiety and self-hate all the beautiful feelings of the procrastinators.
The question when the monkey is behind the wheel is: how does the procradorator move himself to the blue zone, an area where things happen less fun and easier but much more important ..
Well, it turns out that he who postpones his work has a guardian king, someone who always watches him and looks at him in his darkest and darkest moments. A person called
Now he sleeps most of the time. But he wakes up suddenly, when any deadline is very close or there is a risk of embarrassment in front of people or losing a job, or any frightening consequence.
And the most important thing is that it's the only thing that scares the monkey.
Now, this monster has been connected to my life lately, because TED officials contacted me six months ago and invited me to talk about it.
Of course I said, yes, it was always my dream to
I speak at the TED conference in the past.
In the midst of all this enthusiasm, the decision-maker was thinking of something else.
He was like, "Are we clear about what we just agreed to?
Do we know what will happen someday in the future?
We should sit down and prepare the speech right now.
“I agree with you in full, but what do you think we should open the maps of Google, bring the picture closer to the bottom of India and explore it for two and a half hours until we reach the top of India, so that we can educate ourselves about this country.”
That's what we did that day.
It turned 6 months into 4, then to 2, then to 1 month. The TED Conference decided to announce the speakers at the conference,
And when I opened the site, I found a picture of my face staring at me.
And guess who woke up?
He began to lose his mind. In a few seconds, the system turned into chaos.
And the monkey rose up - remember, the monkey is afraid of the beast of panic - and ran to the tree!
Finally, he was able to take the helm and I was able to start working on the lecture.
Now it represents all kinds of crazy behaviors of the procrastinators, such as how I was able to spend two weeks all kinds of behaviors on writing one sentence in my thesis, and then miraculously, the words come continuously in two days to write 8 pages!.
This whole situation with the three characters, this is the system of the procrastinator.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write on the blog two years ago.
And when I wrote, I was struck by the responses,
Thousands of letters have reached me, of all kinds of people, from all over the world, working all sorts of jobs.
They were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, a lot of PhD students,
And they all said, "I have the same problem," and they said, "I have the same problem."
What surprised me was the contrast between the lightness of the words I wrote and the weight of these letters.
These people were writing with great frustration about what procrastination did to them in their lives, about what this monkey did to them.
And when I thought about it, I thought, "If the procrastination system is working, what's going on?"
Why are these people so disappointed?
Turns out there are two types of procrastination.
Everything I talked about today, all the examples, all have a deadline.
And when there are deadlines, the delay effect is contained and pressured in the short term to intervene.
But there is another kind of postponement, a kind that happens in circumstances that have no deadline.
For example, if you want to start a freelance business, something in art, or a pioneering business. These works have no deadlines at first, because nothing happened in the first place. If you go out and start the hard work to gain some activity to do the other work.
There are also a lot of important work outside of your business and it doesn’t include deadlines. Such as visiting your family or sports and taking care of your health, working to develop your relationships, or cutting bad relationships.
Now, if the only way the procrastinator to finish these difficult things is by way, there is a problem, because in all these important works that do not contain the deadlines of the beast will not appear.
There's no date to wake up for. So, the delay effect will not be contained, and therefore, these works will continue and extend forever.
This is the kind of long-term procrastination that is not seen and does not talk much about it, such as the first type: fun, short-term and has deadlines.
People of the second type usually suffer calmly and privately.
This procrastination can be a great source of long-term grief and remorse.
And I thought, ‘That’s why these people are texting me, and that’s why they’re in such a bad state.
Not because they're aiming for a specific project,
It's because of that long-term delay that made them spectators, sometimes, for their own lives.
Their frustration does not come from not achieving their dreams, but because they could not seek them in the first place.
While I read the letters, I was kind of inspired: I don't think anyone doesn't put off their work.
That's right, I think you're all procrastinators,
Of course, you may not be a mess. Like some of us. Some of you may be on good terms with appointments and stick to them. But remember, the monkey's secret trick is when there's no deadline.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call this:
Each square represents a week in a 90-year life,
There don't seem to be many. Especially since we've used a lot of them before.
I think we all need to take a deep look at this table.
And we have to think about what we're really putting off, because each of us has something to put it off in our lives.
We must remain wary of the instant pleasure monkey,
This is a job for all of us.
And because there's not that many boxes in the table, that's a job you have to start today.
Um, maybe not "today" but...
You know,
Sometime soon...
Thanks.
We were there, souls and overcrowded bodies in the Texas church on the last night of our lives.
Stacked in a room like this, but with wooden chairs with an annoying squeak covered in balan red cloth, with an argan to my left and a choir from my back and a baptism basin fixed in the wall behind them.
A room like this, but...
With the same strong sense of suspense, the same deep hope for salvation, the same sweat in the palms of the hands and the same people who do not listen in the back.
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the second coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I know it.
That year I turned twelve and reached the age of accountability.
Once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was for Jesus to come back again as soon as I became responsible for everything I had done, I decided it was better for me to solve my own problems so quickly.
That's why I went to church as much as I could.
I listen to stillness with the same eagerness that a person might listen to the noise, trying to make sure that the Lord did not deceive me, so I decided to come back early.
And if he did, I had prepared a plan B, reading the series "The Leavers Behind", which was the last fashion of the time.
I found among its pages that if I didn’t have an orgasm at midnight, I had another attempt.
All I had to do was avoid being branded by the beast, fighting the demons, the pilgries and the enemy of Christ Himself.
It's gonna be hard-- but I know I can do it.
Now the planning time is over.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We have ten minutes left, and my priest has invited us from the seats to the altar because he wanted the prayer to be held when it was midnight.
That's why each faction of the cults took its place.
The choir stayed in its platform, the deacons and their wives -- or the baptized bourgeoisie as I like to call them -- occupied the first place at the altar.
You see, in America, even the second coming of Christ has a VIP section.
Behind the completely baptized bourgeois were the elderly -- the men and women whose young backs were burned under the burning suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin was polished because of the burning in a noble brown, just like the mud of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams were tilted and their dreams of what life outside East Texas might become even more than their backs.
Yeah, for me these men and women were the stars of the show.
They waited their whole lives for that moment, just as their medieval ancestors yearned for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for Oprah Winfrey on Channel Eight every day at four o’clock.
And just as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother would definitely go to heaven.
And I thought that if I held her hand during this prayer, that I might go with her in the right direction.
That's why I held on and closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
The prayers became louder.
The shouts of the prayer call continue to rise further.
The ergan continued to add the funerary hymn.
The heat came to add sweat.
And I held my hand more firmly, so that I would not be the one left in the open.
And I closed my eyes so hard that I wouldn't see the nausea separated from the fat.
Then a voice roared over us: "Amen."
It's over.
I looked at the clock.
It was just after midnight.
I looked at the older believers whose Savior, who were so proud that they seemed to be disappointed, who had so much believed for a long time to begin to doubt.
But I was upset instead.
They've been tricked, defrauded, misled, and I've gotten along with them all the time.
I prayed their prayers, I've been as far away from all temptation as I can.
I dipped my head not once, but twice in the baptism pool that drives to blur.
I believed.
And now what?
I got home just in time to open the TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium as it rolled around the world.
It has become clear to me that it would be strange anyway for Christ to return again and again depending on the different time zones.
And that made me feel ridiculous -- more hurt, really.
That night, I never stopped believing.
But I believed in something new: you might not believe.
It is possible that the answers I had are wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Now, in the past where there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubt running towards its base, a promising spring with rivers.
I can trace all the drama in my life from that night in the church when my Savior did not come; when it became clear that the thing I believed in with certainty, if not a lie, is at least not the truth.
Although most of you have prepared for the new millennium in a very different way, I am sure that you are here because a part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left and my father has remained far away and my Lord has refused to come.
I spread my hand, looking for something I believe in.
When I arrived at Yale at the age of eighteen, I was confident that my trip from Oak Lev, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges I had, the broken dreams, the defeated bodies I saw.
But when I found myself on one of the winter holidays in my city lying on my face, my hands tied behind my back and the robber's gun pointed at my head, I understood that even the best education couldn't save me.
I held out when I came to trainee at Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Full of hope -- I even called home to tell my family that we're not going to be poor again.
But I witnessed the collapse of this temple of money in front of my eyes, I understood that even the best job could not save me.
I held out when I came to Washington as a young employee, hearing a voice from Illinois calling out, “It’s been a long time, but in this election, there’s going to be a change in America.”
But since Congress has stopped and the state has collapsed and hope and change have seemed like a cruel joke, I understood that even the second political coming could not save me.
I knelt sincerely before the altar of the American dream, praying to the gods of my time for success, money, and power.
But over and over again, it's midnight, and I open my eyes to find that all those gods are dead.
And from that cemetery, I started searching again, not because I was brave, but because I understood that I would either believe or die.
That's why I went to the pilgrimage but to a place other than Mecca, the Harvard Business School, realizing this time that I would not be able to accept the salvation that was allegedly offered.
No, I knew there'd be more work.
He started working from a dark spot at a crowded party, late in Cambridge’s wretched winter when three friends and I asked a question that young people who had been looking for something real for so long asked: What if we went on a car trip?
We didn't know where we could go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because as Jack Kerrock wrote all our lives, we've been eager to "snuck in the night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what people are doing all over the country.
So despite other voices saying that the risk was too great, and success is uncertain, we went anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 8,000 miles across America, between the cow pastures in Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the New Orleans swamps, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses where the impact is the bottom line.
Since we are trained at the Military Academy of Capitalism, we are surprised by that revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, and it turned into a non-profit organization called MIAS through America, that movement made me stand here on this stage.
It has spread because we have found a great yearning for our generation to find purpose and meaning.
It has spread because we have found an infinite number of entrepreneurs in the dark corners and corners of America who were creating jobs, changing lives, and needing a little help.
But to be honest, it spread out because I fought to spread.
There were no limits I could stand to preach this gospel, and to make more people believe that we can heal the wounds of a broken state, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was that missionary journey that led me to the very different gospel that I came to share with you today.
It started one night a year ago at the Natural History Museum in New York, at the Harvard Business School alumni ceremony.
Under a complete replica of a wove, I sat down with the giants of our time as they celebrated their fellowship and good deeds.
There was a sense of pride where capital and assets under management exceeded half a trillion dollars.
We looked at everything we did, and it was good.
But two days later, I had to travel north to Harlem, where I found myself sitting on an urban farm that was once an empty land, listening to a man named Tony tell me about the children who come there every day.
They all live below the poverty line.
Many carry all their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in the homeless shelter.
Some of them came to Tony's program, called Harlem the Developing, to get their only meal every day.
Tony told me that he started "Developing Harlem" from his retirement money, having worked as a taxi driver for twenty years.
He told me that he doesn’t give himself a salary, because despite the success he’s had, the program still has a lack of resources.
He told me he might take any help he could get.
And I was there as this helper.
But as soon as I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of tears falling from my eyes.
I felt the blow of inspiration that one night I could sit in the same room, with a few hundred people with half a trillion dollars, and two days later, in another room, 50 blocks north, where a man who doesn't get paid to save a child her only meal a day.
It wasn’t the blatant inequality that made me cry, and it wasn’t the idea of hunger, the homeless children, it wasn’t anger toward the one percent or the pity of the 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was like a dialysis of a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story represents all those who are expected to solve their own problems even if they have nothing to help them; my organization represents all those structural and systemic aids that have never before reached Harlem or Appalachia or the lower ninth district; my voice represents all those voices that seem illiterate, dirty, and very ill-equipped.
And the shame of that, that shame immersed me like a shame to sit in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium again and again and again.
You were deceived, deceived, misguided.
But this time, I was the false savior.
As you can see, I have come a long way from that altar on the night that I thought the world would end, from a world where people speak in vague language and see suffering as an inevitable divine law and have taken it as an inerorable truth.
Yeah, I'm so much better that I'm back where I started.
Because it's simply not right to say that we live in an age of atheism -- no, we believe today just like ever.
Some of us may be believing in the prophecy of Brenné Brown or Tony Robbins.
We may be believers in the New Yorker as a Bible or Harvard Business Review.
We may feel a deeper faith when we worship here at the TED church, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of attractive and influential leaders that promises to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as the inevitable law of capitalism, that is our God, we accept the text of technological progress as an inerorable fact.
We rarely realize the human price we pay when we fail to question in one step, because we fear that this will undermine our entire institution.
But if you're confused by the unreasonable things we have to accept, then it must be a time for accountability.
So I don't have the gospel of disorder or renewal or TPL.
Today I do not have the gospel of faith to share with you.
In fact, what I have and what I am displaying is the gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask you to stop believing, it asks you to believe in something new: it is possible that you do not believe.
It's possible that the answers we have are wrong, that it's possible that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we are on this stage, in this room, wrong.
Because it raises a question of why?
With all the power at our fingertips, why do humans still suffer so badly?
This doubt led me to participate, and we put our MBAS across America out of business.
We have fired staff and closed our doors and will share our model for free with anyone who believes they can do this work without waiting for our consent.
This doubt has forced me to give up the role of the Savior entrusted to me by some, because our time is so short and our opportunities are far away to wait for Her second coming, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it feeds me and gives me hope that when our problems are overwhelmed, when the paths are revealed to us and they seem to lead us to our death, when our therapists offer no relief to our wounds, our blind faith will not be -- it will be our humble doubt that shed some light on the darkness of our lives and our world and allow us to raise our voices to whisper.
Or to shout or to simply say, “There must be another way.”
Thanks.
food crisis.
News that goes on the news every day.
But what is it?
Lack of food in some parts of the world or may be a lot.
In other regions, genetically modified food saves the world.
May modified food be the problem?
Too much waste dumping into the sea creates bad oceans and toxic oceans, and weakens the feed.
And it never continues like this.
I think the current climate of this debate is not terribly constructive.
How can we bring this closer to something we can understand?
How is this apple a food crisis?
You all must have had an apple last week.
How old do you think this apple is from the moment it was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months - the average age of an apple in a grocery in the United States
I don’t expect the average to be very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them up, we put them in cold tanks and then we fill the tanks with gas -- there's actually documentary evidence of cases where workers tried to get into these environments to retrieve an apple, and they died, because of the air in the interior used to slow down the apple process that causes poisoning in humans.
How come no one of you knew about this before?
Why didn't I know this before?
Ninety percent of the quality of that apple -- all the antioxidants -- they're gone by the time we get them.
It's just a sugar ball.
How have we become so little informative and how can we improve?
I think what we're missing is a program.
I know software -- I know computers, they got me online when I was little.
I did very strange things -- on this program.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a program, we could feel rushed to ask: What if?
To me, I asked: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a climate map of the world.
The most productive areas in green, and the least produced in red.
They exchange and change, and farmers from California are now Mexican farmers.
China takes land from Braille to grow better food, and we're climate slaves.
What if every country has its own product climate?
What's gonna change that's gonna make our living?
What will change the quality of life and food?
The problem with the previous generation was, we need more food and we need it to be cheap.
Welcome to your global farm.
We built a giant model of a farm.
All these effects -- are the effects of cars and the pilots and the trains and the wheels.
It’s a miracle we feed 7 billion people with a few of us involved in food production.
What if...
We built a digital farm?
A global digital farm.
What if you could take this apple, sort it out somehow, send it through particles in the air, and reassemble it at the other end?
What if?
I'll read some of these things. They inspired me to do what I do.
“Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, no future.” This is what I landed the day I visited Minamisanrki in southern Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children headed towards Sandai and Tokyo. The land is contaminated, they import seventy percent of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Two percent of the U.S. population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from two percent of a country’s population?
When we walk around the world, 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
80% don't want to be farmers.
Agriculture is hard.
The life of a small, miserable stockholder farmer.
They go to town.
In India, families of farmers are unable to access basic services. The number of farmers who committed suicide this year and the previous year is more than the previous ten.
It's uncomfortable to talk about this.
Where are they going?
To the city.
No guys, and everyone's headed there.
How do we build this program that inspires young people?
Welcome to the new agricultural tractor.
That's my compilation.
In previous years, I went to Bede Bath, Beyond, and Home Depot and started the relationship.
And I built stupid things, and I made the plants dance, and I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all -- a lot.
In the end, I made them survive.
And I made one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had, because I was learning plant language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They say, "Do this, boy!
This is an old unwanted electronic room.
What can you do?
My team and I built a farm inside the media lab, a place that is not known throughout history to anything about biology, but everything about virtual life.
Inside these 60 square feet we produced enough food to feed 300 people a month - not much.
And there's a lot of exciting technology out there.
But the most exciting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors and a monthly harvest.
Is this the new cafeteria?
Is this the new retail experience?
Is this the new grocery store?
I can say one thing for sure: this is the first time someone in the media lab has taken the roots off of anything.
We get power with bags; nothing is wrong with this.
But what happens when you have a processing expert based on images, a data scientist, they take root and think, "H. I know something about -- I can do this, I want to try."
In the process, we're going to take the plants out and we're going to take some of them to the lab, because when you grow them, you don't throw them away; they're kind of precious to you.
I have this strange tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anyone eat anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the lettuce acidity up to one ten.
I say, "No, this is 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat this day."
Lettuce that day was very sweet.
It was very sweet because the plant was exhausting and created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I will not die!"
And the plant that won't die, tastes sweet to me.
Technology has retreated backwards in plant physiology.
We thought that other people needed to do this.
We wanted to see what people could do, so we imagined a lab that we could ship anywhere.
Then we made it.
So in the front of the medical laboratory comes my lab, which has 30 sensor points per plant.
If you know about genome or genetics, that's the phenomenon, right?
The phenomenon.
When you say "I love strawberries from Mexico," you really love strawberries from the climate that produced the phrase you love.
So, if you're programming a climate -- so of carbon dioxide and so oxygen creates a recipe -- you're programmed by the phrase for this plant, the food for this plant, the size of this plant, its shape, its color, its texture.
We need data. So we put a bunch of sensors in there to show us what's going on.
If you think about your plants, and you look at them in the extreme misery because you're saying to him, "Why are you dying?
Farmers have developed the most beautiful eyes for astrology when they are in their late 60s and 70s.
They can tell you when to see the plant die due to a lack of nitrogen, a lack of calcium or the need for more moisture.
These beautiful eyes are not passed on by heirs.
These eyes are in the virtual cloud of the farmer.
We extend these data points over time.
We link these data points to individual plants.
These are the broccoli in my lab that day, via the address of the Internet protocol.
Our Broccoli has an IP address.
If this isn't weird enough, you can click on one and get a plant profile.
And it teaches you the evolution of the removable plant, but not as you think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does it get to the food I need?
When does it achieve the taste I want?
Does he get too much water?
Does he get a lot of sun?
Warnings.
He can talk to me, he's a speaker, we have a language.
I think this is the first Facebook user of plants, right?
This is the information of this plant and this plant will start by adding friends to God.
And I mean that -- it'll add friends from other plants that use less nitrogen or more phosphorus, less potassium.
We'll learn about the complexities we're still guessing right now.
And you may not agree with our friendship -- I don't know, and you may agree to our friendship request, depending on our actions.
Well, this is my lab.
It's a little better organized, and my experience comes from designing hospital data centers for everything, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
So -- within this environment, we're running tests of all sorts of things,
This process, hydroponics, was developed from the Mir Space Station to reduce the amount of water carried into space.
This process works on the basis of giving the plant exactly what it needs: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated, so once you give it to her, you get that amazing expression.
And that's what it's like to have two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a whole world.
We've gone far in the path of technology and a seed to a negative world and we're going to keep doing that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is a whole world.
Well, we've planted all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know we have stores of rare and ancient seeds?
Banks or banks for seeds.
It's amazing.
It has living assets and things you've never eaten.
And I'm the only one in this room who's eaten this kind of tomato.
And the problem was, it was like a tomato paste that we didn't know how to cook, so we ate tomato paste and it wasn't so good.
We have done a lot with protein. We've raised all sorts of things.
We have raised even humans. Well, you might be, but we didn't do it.
But what we've confirmed is that, the tool was very large and very expensive,
And I was starting to distribute it around the world and it was worth about $100,000.
And just to find someone with 100 grand in his back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted another little job.
And this project was actually for one of my students -- a mechanical engineer named Camille.
And Camille and me and my team, we've been around all summer how to make it cheaper, how we make it work better, how we make it so that other people can make it.
Then we distributed it in schools between the seventh and eleventh grades.
And if you really want to humiliate, try to teach a child something.
And so I went into that school and I said, "Organize it on 65% humidity."
One seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"
I said, "Ha, it's the water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you're stupid."
And I said what it was like, "Well, don't trust me.
Actually-- you don't trust me, do you?
Put it on 100.
Put it on 100, what happened?
He started condensing, creating a fog and then he started dripping.
And he said, "Oh. The humidity is rain.
Why didn't you just tell me that?
We've got a connection to this is a lot like a game.
They have a three-dimensional environment, they can access it from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or their little computers.
They have different parts of the means - natural, sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children anywhere in the world.
They pick the recipe, turn it on, and plant a seed.
And as they grow, they make changes?
They say, "Why does a plant need carbon dioxide?
Isn't it bad?
If we increase the gas, the plant dies.
If we lower it, the plant grows well.
I harvest the plant, you've created a new digital recipe.
It is an interactive design and development and an exploration process.
And then they can memorize that, and all the data about the new plant that they've developed or the new digital recipe and what you did -- was it better or worse?
Imagine this as a small hub of operations.
We'll learn a lot.
And this is one of the food computers, as we call it, in school three weeks later.
That's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it's the first time this boy has thought of becoming a farmer -- or that he's going to want to be a farmer.
That's why we opened all this to the public.
It's on the Internet, go home and try to build your first food computer.
It's gonna be hard-- that's what I tell you.
We're first, but everything's there.
It's important for me to get in easy.
And we'll keep trying to make it easier.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, botanist, economist, city planner.
They work on one basis what they do well.
But we've grown a little bit more.
This is my facility that I just started working on.
The warehouse can be anywhere.
That's why I chose him.
And inside this warehouse, we're going to build something like this, for example.
And it exists now.
Look at her carefully.
It does exist too.
One is raising vegetables, and another is raising a vaccine for Ebola.
It's great that these plants and the winner of the Grand Defense Research Agency's grand prize are one of the reasons we're ahead of Ebola.
Plants produce protein resistant to Ebola disease.
As well as pharmacists and food specialists, down to lettuce.
But these two things are unlike each other, and here I look with my field.
Everything is different.
We've come up with the weird "all-good thing" situation, and she's like, "This is my black box --" and "No, they bought my box."
"No, no, no -- I have very valuable intellectual property rights.
"Buy my box, not his."
The fact is that we are still at the beginning, at a time when society is moving as well.
When we order more cheap food, we don’t ask for better, green food.
And when McDonald announces what's in the chicken balls, the strangest food of all time -- and they're building their marketing plan on it -- everything changes.
Now let's get into the world.
Private food computers, caterers and food data centers are working on an open phenomenon.
Think of an open genetic map, but we'll put in it small climatic recipes, like Wikipedia, that can close their pages and turn them and grow them.
What's that like in the world?
Remember the world is tied to threads?
We started finding the lighthouses.
We started sending information about food, instead of sending food.
This is not my imagination, this is what we're actually posting right now.
Food computers and food servers, and soon food data centers, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not fighting for what is bad about this.
We know what's bad about this.
The future of food is about tying the next billion farmers and strengthening them to a base to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you
There are times when I'm really ashamed of being European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response was, frankly, pathetic.
There are so many contradictions,
They deeply mourned the tragic death of a two-year-old Kurdish child, and since then, more than 200 children later drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, but we have accepted that small Lebanon hosts more Syrians than from Europe.
We regret that there are human smugglers, but we have made it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of labor, but we have excluded those people who meet our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We profess the liberal values that we have in opposing fanatical Islam, but -- we have repressive policies that hinder asylum seekers, divide children from their families, and withhold refugee property.
What do we do?
How did the situation come to this point, by adopting this inhumane policy to face this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think the reason for this is that people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
But I think the reason for this is that our politicians lack the vision, a vision of how to adopt an international refugee system created more than 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and I ask two fundamental questions, we all need to ask the two questions,
The first question is, why isn't the current system working?
And second of all, what can we do to fix this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of World War II by these men.
Its main goal is to ensure that when the state fails, or worse happens, that the regime turns against its people, people find a place to go, to live in security and dignity so that they can return to their homeland.
I was created specifically for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and UNHCR, it established that states should reciprocate people on their territory fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
But in practice, our immigration policies are based on cutting off the road to safety.
In theory, the refugee has the right to be integrated into society, or to be returned to the country from which he came,
But in reality, their fate remains forgotten indefinitely.
In theory, the refugee issue is a shared global responsibility.
But in practice, geography means that countries close to conflict take the vast majority of the world’s refugees.
This system is not broken because its rules are wrong.
We have not applied it sufficiently in this changing world, and this is what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
But not from top to bottom in terms of institutional perspective, rather than from the perspective of refugees.
So imagine a Syrian woman,
And let's call her a princess,
And a princess to me represents a lot of the people I've met in the region.
Amira, who represents about 25 percent of the world’s refugees, is a woman with children, and she cannot go home because she came from this city that you see before you, which is Homs, a city that was once beautiful and historic and now under the rubble.
A princess cannot go there.
It also has no hope of resettlement in a third country, as it is only available as a lottery ticket to less than one percent of the world’s refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that Amira can take her family to the camp,
It is possible to get help, but there are very few expectations in front of a princess and her family.
The camps are in dark, arid places, often in the desert.
In Jordan’s Zaatari camp, you can hear the sound of shells at night across the border in Syria.
There is restricted economic activity.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around the world, about 80 percent of refugees living in camps must stay there for at least five years.
It’s a miserable life, and that’s probably why, in fact, only nine percent of Syrians have resorted to this option.
Instead, Amira can go to urban areas to neighboring cities, such as Amman or Beirut.
This was made by about 75 percent of Syrian refugees.
But there is a great difficulty as well,
Refugees in these urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They usually can't get to help.
So when a princess and her family used their basic savings, they were more likely to face urban poverty.
So there's a third alternative for them, and that's why our refugee numbers have increased.
A princess can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a perilous journey to another country, and that’s what we’re seeing in Europe today.
Around the world, we are facing refugees who often have no other choice between the three options: camp, poverty in neighboring urban areas, or a perilous journey.
For refugees, this option is today’s global refugee system.
But I think it's a wrong choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason for reducing these options is because we believe that these are the only options that refugees have, and there are no other options.
The politicians framed the issue as a zero-sum issue, so that if we benefit from the refugees, we will impose costs on the citizens.
We tend to make a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden on society.
But this is not necessarily necessary and they can contribute to society,
And what I'd like to put forward is that we can expand those options so that they benefit everyone: host countries, communities, our communities, our own refugees.
So I would like to suggest four ways in which we can change the way we think about the refugee issue.
And all four of these ways have a common denominator: they are the same ways that we've got globalization, mobility and markets, and modernizing the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first way I would like to think about is the idea of enabling environments, which starts with the basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Along with my colleagues in Oxford, I embarked on a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is representative of all the host countries.
It's not. It's because it's exceptional.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunities.
She gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences are extraordinary for both refugees and host communities.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own businesses that employ other people, and 40 percent of those employees are citizens of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens in the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional examples of thriving and vibrant entrepreneurial companies,
For example, in a settlement called Nakival, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
We found Rwandans who run the available business that allows young people to play computer games from TVs and recycled games,
Unlike the restrictions imposed on them elsewhere, the refugees are innovating, and the man you see in front of you is a Congolese named Demo-Kay.
Demo-Kay arrived in this settlement with very little, but wanted to be a director.
So he started with a local radio station, with a group of friends and colleagues, he rented a video camera, and he's now a filmmaker, and he's a movie maker.
He made two documentaries with our team, and he succeeded in setting up a very small business.
It’s the kind of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities that seek human prosperity.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter and food are all important in the emergency phase, but we also have to look further.
We need to provide opportunities for connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the ways we are taking to reach the global economy can and must apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have practiced the same methods as us,
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still realistic alternative options that we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, accompanied by development economist Paul Collier, and thought of an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to offer job opportunities to Syrians by supporting Jordan’s national development strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into work alongside the employment of Jordanian host citizens.
Just 15 minutes from Zaatari camp, there is a habitat of 83,000 refugees, the current economic zone called King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone.
The government has spent more than a hundred million dollars to connect it to the electricity grid and roads, but it lacks two things: access to work and internal investment.
Instead of being stuck in the camps, they will be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We are aware that Jordan can benefit from this, whose development strategy requires a qualitative leap from a middle-income country to a manufacturing country.
It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the post-conflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the ultimate source of Syria’s reconstruction.
We published the idea in Foreign Affairs magazine.
King Abdullah picked up this idea,
It was announced in London at the Syria conference two weeks ago and will be rolled out next summer.
The third idea that I want to put in your hands is the homogeneous preference between countries and refugees to reach happy results like the one you see here in the personal photos that include Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
What we rarely did was ask the refugees what they wanted, where they wanted to go, but what I care about to say is that we can do it and make everyone better off.
Economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of homogeneous markets, in such ways that the order of preference for the parties constitutes a final homogeneity.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tittleboim have devised ways to apply this idea to refugees by asking refugees about their favorite places, but they also allow countries to classify the types of refugees they want to host based on skill or language criteria and allow them to engage.
Now, of course, you need to build quotas like diversity and vulnerability, but it's the way to increase the potential for integration.
The idea of integration has been used successfully, for example, the involvement of students in universities, and the involvement of kidney donors with patients, and lies behind the algorithms on dating sites.
Why not apply the idea of giving refugees greater options?
It can also be used at the national level. Since one of the big challenges we face is convincing communities to accept refugees.
At the moment, in my country, for example, we often send rural engineers and farmers to cities, and this makes no sense at all.
The homogenization of markets provides a potential way to achieve these preferences together and to listen to the needs and demands of the host population and refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put in your hands is humanitarian visas.
A lot of the tragedies and chaos that we saw in Europe could have been completely avoided.
It proceeds from the fundamental contradiction in Europe’s asylum policy: In order to obtain asylum in Europe, you must come spontaneously through those perilous journeys that you have described.
But why should such dangerous flights be necessary when we are in the era of economical airlines and the capabilities of modern embassies?
It’s absolutely unnecessary trips, and last year, it led to the deaths of more than 3000 people on Europe’s borders and within European territory.
If refugees are simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we will avoid it, and there is a way to do so through something called a humanitarian visa, which allows people to obtain a visa at an embassy or consulate of a neighboring country where they simply pay for their trip by ship or fly to Europe.
About 1000 thousand euros is the cost of smuggling a refugee from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It costs €200 to fly economy from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allow the refugees to do this, it's gonna have big positives.
It will save lives and we will completely cut off the smuggling market and remove the chaos that we see on the front line of Europe in areas like the Greek islands.
It's the policy that prevents us from doing it instead of a rational solution,
This idea has been applied,
Brazil has adopted a pioneering method, where more than 2000 Syrians have been able to obtain humanitarian visas, and when they enter Brazil they receive a refugee description.
Every Syrian in that project enjoys refugee status and has been recognized as a real refugee.
There is another historical precedent as well,
Between 1922 and 1942, these passports were used as travel documents to allow the transfer of 45,000 Armenians, Chechens and Turks to travel through Europe and obtain refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The International Office for Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
So all four ideas that I've presented to you are a way through which we can expand the scope of a princess's choices,
They are ways we can get great refugee options away from the three basic impossible options I’ve explained to you so you’ll leave others better.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that expands refugee options but realizes that they should not be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yes, it is a humanitarian and responsible issue, but they are human beings who have skills, talents and ambitions, and have the ability to contribute. If we let them.
In the new world, immigration is not on the way to extinction.
What we have seen in Europe will be present with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, and they will continue to be displaced from their homelands, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this. It is not based on the old logic of humanitarian assistance, it is not based on the logic of charity, but on the construction of opportunities offered by mobility and globalized markets,
I assure you that we must wake up from our inattention and urge politicians to wake up to meet this challenge.
Thank you so much.
When I was a little boy, I always dreamed of the ocean.
That wild place, full of color and life, was home to those strange, imaginary creatures.
I photographed the big sharks that dominate the food chain and saw the graceful sea turtles dancing around the reef.
As a marine biologist I became a photographer, I spent most of my career looking for magical places like the ones I dreamed of when I was young.
As you can see, I started discovering sea bodies at a relatively early age.
But the first time I was deep in the water, I was ten years old.
And I still remember very well when I was swimming fiercely to get to that old cannon clad in the shallow corals.
And when I finally got to it, I looked up, and I was surrounded by fish from everywhere in all the colors of the rainbow.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Bishak is a photographer for the conservation of my 40s on the planet, and I had the opportunity to discover some of the amazing seascapes of National Geographic and the Foundation for the Protect Our Seas.
I've photographed everything from big sharks to the little ones that matched my palm.
I inhaled the suspicious smell of humpback whales, which fed a foot away with the cold seas of Canada in the rainforest of the great bear.”
I was familiar with the mating rituals of the sea green turtle in the Mozambique Strait.
Everyone on this planet is affected by the ocean and affected by it.
The ancient and clean seas I dreamed of as a child have become very difficult to find.
The seas are under more pressure and more threatened.
As human beings, we still maintain our role as predators on earth, and I have witnessed and photographed many of these immediate effects.
For a long time, I thought I'd shock my audience with their indifference through some disturbing images.
Although this approach has advantages, I went back to the beginning.
I believe that the best way to change is to sell love.
I think I play the role of a kind of “suitor” and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to uncover the animals and entire ecosystems that lie beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can't fall in love with something and become a hero to it if you don't know it exists.
By revealing this -- that's the power of photographics for the province.
I have visited hundreds of naval sites, but only a few seascapes have caught my attention and have had a profound impact.
The first time I experienced that rise was about 10 years ago, off the rugged and land-based coasts of South Africa.
In June and July, massive swarms of sardines travel north in mass migration of what we call “sardine escape.”
And those fish have a good reason to escape.
They are hunted by predators and agiles.
They catch dolphins in a common way and can disperse a swarm of sardines to create small, attractive groups of fish.
You lure the fish to the surface of the ocean and then they rush to dinner to celebrate.
The sharks are believed to be behind it.
Now, most people think that both sharks and dolphins are deadly enemies, but during the “sardine escape,” they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to feed effectively.
Without the help of dolphins, food balls are more scattered and sharks often end up eating so-called sardine doughnuts, or with a mouth full of water.
Now, having experienced exciting moments with sharks during the Sardine Escape, I knew they didn't see me as a prey.
However, I'm being slapped like any other guest during this very tumultuous feast.
From the shores of Africa, let's travel to the east, where the vast Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of the atolls.
During the stormy southwest monsoon, demon sea fish travel through the archipelago to a small spot in Baa Atoll called Hapiro.
Large groups of crustaceans, most of which do not exceed the size of the pupil, are the staple food of tain fish.
When the amount of moss plants becomes tiny, the mantafish feed on their own and flip many times around themselves, like a small puppy chasing their tail.
When the amount of moss plants rises, the sea devils line up behind each other to be a long food chain, and if the first fish can’t eat, of course, it will be possessed by the loyal fish.
The lower the amount of algae in the Gulf, the closer the sea demons get to each other, a unique behavior called cyclone-shaped nutrition.
Since they hover in a narrow form, this group of sea demons creates a kind of hurricane, absorbing the algae and introducing them to their mouths.
The experience of diving among hundreds of sea devil fish is truly unique and memorable.
When Hanevaru first photographed, this area was unprotected and was threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my photos inevitably helped make the Hanivaru area a protected area.
Now, fishermen from neighboring islands have once hunted sea demons to make traditional drums out of the skin of these fish.
Today, they are one of the most enthusiastic conservatives and the Maldivian economy because of the sea devils earns over $8 million each year.
I've always wanted to go back in time in an era when maps were mostly empty or they read, "There's a dragon."
Today, the nearest place I have visited is the remote islands of the western Indian Ocean.
Away from the sea lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is an emotional reminder of what our oceans were once.
A few people have heard of Bassas da Andea, a small spot of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
It is a coral people that represents a protective outer barrier and the inner lake is the nursery place for the Galápagos sharks.
Those sharks were shy even during the day.
I had a feeling that they would be bolder and their number would rise at night.
I've never encountered many sharks on coral bumps.
Filming moments like this and sharing them with everyone -- reminds me why I chose my path.
Sometime this year, I was on a mission to National Geographic magazine in Baja California.
About halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side is San Ignacio Lagoon, the birthplace of the gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast has been a massacre, with more than 20,000 grey whales killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today, the descendants of the same whales are pushing their young children to the surface to play and even interact with us.
I have really seen these species a remarkable return.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula is Cabo Belmo, a quiet fishing island.
Decades of indiscriminate hunting have caused the collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the authorities to declare their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was no less than a miracle.
In 2005, after just a decade of protection, scientists measured the extent of fish recovery.
But don't hear a word from me -- come with me.
With just one breath, dive deep into me, one of the biggest places to find the fish I've ever encountered.
We all have the power to create some kind of hope.
Through my photography, I want to spread the message: It’s not too late to protect our oceans.
And I want to focus especially on, the resilience and ease of adaptation of nature to the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will look more and more to do images like this, creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
I hope it becomes a daily event for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be hopelessly optimistic.
And always work on the premise that the wonderful image that will make a change is only very close, behind the next coral, inside the next lake or perhaps in the lake that follows.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was the basis of Zimbabwe’s national health policy.
The new government emerged after a long war of independence and immediately declared a socialist program: both health care and primary education services became essentially free.
Rural health centres have been deployed where nearly 80 percent of the population can access these services in less than two hours on foot, a huge achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, about 25% of children in Zimbabwe were vaccinated.
By 1990, just a decade later, this figure was 80%.
I felt very proud to be a part of this transformation, this revolution.
That feeling of excitement and friendship was evident.
Working alongside the smart citizens of Zimbabwe — scientists, doctors, activists — I felt my belonging not only to the African independence movement, but also to the public health movement in progress.
But there were enormous challenges.
Zimbabwe announced the first case of AIDS in 1985, the year it was introduced.
I took care of a number of people with AIDS in the early 1980's, when I did medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what was in the Africa warehouse.
The infection rate increased by about 2% during the first days I was there.
This could rise for one in four adults 17 years after the time Harare left.
By mid-1990, I had learned about hundreds of people in a very small year who had been infected with HIV.
I've seen many colleagues and friends die, my students and patients in hospitals, die.
In response to these cases, I, along with my colleagues, established a hospital.
We've made several interventions to explain the use of condoms.
We have made interventions in places of education and work.
We did research. We provided guidance to injured men’s partners on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard and at the time I thought I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, just like it was.
I wasn’t talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke of his personal failure that led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping.
On the 10-year anniversary of the genocide, he stated, “I thought I was doing my best, but after the genocide I realized that there were a lot of things that could have been done or I had to do to sound the alarm and join forces to provide support.”
The AIDS epidemic has killed the health of an unprepared society, and today the World Health Organization has estimated that nearly 39 million people have died from the disease.
But while I was living in Zimbabwe, I didn’t see myself as an advocate or a politician.
I was there to improve my technical skills, my epidemiology skills.
In my mind, my profession is to care for patients and do research to better understand the patterns of transmission between populations, and I was hoping to slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that the socially marginalized classes of the population are most at risk of contracting AIDS and dying.
For sugar cane farms, which are more like a feudal system than any modern institution, 60 percent of pregnant women have been infected with HIV.
It has made it clear that the injury is not about moral decay, but about the culture of male superiority, the employment of forced immigrants and colonialism.
As health professionals, our tools were very limited: we were calling on people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms and limit the number of partners.
Infection rates rose, and when treatment became available in the West, the treatment that is still our most powerful weapon against this virus, the treatment was not available to the public sector in Africa.
I did not mention the inequality in access to these life-saving drugs or the implicit economic and political systems that were the cause of infection rates among the large population.
I justified Scotty by reminding myself that I was only a guest in this country. And to sound the alarm can get me fired, prevent me from doing good work, taking care of patients, and doing the research I need most.
So I didn't talk about the government's early stance on AIDS.
I didn't express my fears loud enough.
Some doctors and health professionals will think I didn't do anything wrong.
Our agreement with our patients, the Hippocratic Department and its derivatives, revolves around the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.
And I've done everything I can for every patient.
But I knew that epidemics were manifested over the extent of the schisms that existed in our society, which reflected not only biology, but more importantly, patterns of marginalization and exclusion, and discrimination related to race, gender, social classes and others.
That's true for AIDS.
This was recently true in the case of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who has studied AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because abuse is inherent in economic and political organization in our social world, often in ways invisible to those with privileges and power, and since violence is a reflection -- premature deaths, suffering, and disease -- are a kind of violence.
We do little things for our patients if we fail to regulate these states of social inequality.
The alarm is the first stage to spread the right to public health, and it is the way to combine support efforts to get out of this situation and achieve some kind of change together.
So these days, I won't stay calm anymore.
I’m going to talk about a lot of things, even if the listeners don’t feel comfortable, even if I don’t feel comfortable either.
A lot of my words will be about racial and racial differences in institutions, things that are supposed to never exist in this country, they are certainly not supposed to exist in the practice of medicine or public health.
But they exist, and we pay them to end our lives prematurely.
That’s why the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States of America, and the ongoing violence between individuals and within institutions and people of black people, multiplying our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow’s laws and 60 years of turbulent equality, should be ringing the alarm bell on this essential and central to doing my job properly as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature death -- death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black people than white people.
A woman with black skin in 2012 risked dying more than 10 times at birth compared to a white woman.
Although we have made tremendous strides in reducing infant mortality, black infants are almost three times more likely to die in their first year than white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics correspond to other statistics throughout the United States.
A recent analysis in the New York Times found that 1.5 million black people are missing.
They noted that more than one in six black men who were supposed to be between 25 and 45 years old had been lost and disappeared from everyday life, who had been in prison or died prematurely.
This is a great kind of inequality in the daily and inappropriate violence faced by young blacks, and the recent protests have centered on the slogan #Blacklife is important.
But we have to remember that the permanent and uneven proportions and the consequences of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes and AIDS -- are diseases that can lead to death slowly and in complete calm and may take many black lives prematurely.
Since the BlackLife movement was important, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community had opposed the use of the word “racism” in our research and studies.
You probably felt something every time I said that word.
Our medical students protested the Di-Ins method in their white blouses, but the medical community has supported it negatively since discrimination still affects the level of illness for people and deaths.
I’m concerned about the trend around precision and personal medicine, in search of biological or genetic goals to develop better therapies, which may inadvertently cause us to be neutral from the overall picture of the subject, which is the everyday context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, and most importantly, determines the health of the population, and for many of us, “poor health.”
As health professionals, in our daily work, both in the hospital and when doing research, we are witnessing a great inequality: a homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has other priorities, transgender young people who are contemplating suicide because our society is so cruel, a single mother who should feel responsible for her son’s poor health.
Our role as health professionals is not only to treat our patients, but to sound the alarm and call for change.
Whether it is credibly or not, our community website gives our voices great credibility, and this should not be compromised.
I regret not talking in Zimbabwe, and I have vowed that as a health commissioner in New York City, I will take every opportunity to ring the alarm and join forces to support health equity.
I will speak out against racism and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you talk about discrimination on the basis of sex or any other form of equality.
It is time for us to rise up and speak out loudly about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, and our health, all of us, depends on it.
Well, by raising your hands, how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something disturbing about politics or religion, child protection or food?
And how many of you are trying to ignore at least one person because you simply don't want to talk to them.
You know, we just had to follow Henry Higgins' advice in My Fair Lady: to stick to the talk of weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and the fight against vaccines, those topics -- they're not safe either.
And so this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to turn into an argument, where politicians can't talk to each other and where even the most trivial issues find someone to fight for them or against them emotionally, it's not normal.
Peo Research conducted a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at the moment, we are more polarized, more divided, than at any time in history.
And it's unlikely that we're getting a compromise, and that means we don't listen to each other,
We make decisions about where we live, who we get married, and even who will be our friends, depending on what we already believe.
Again, it means we don't listen to each other.
Conversation requires the harbouring of speech and listening, and somewhere along the way, this conversation we lose that balance.
Now, part of that is up to technology.
Smartphones that are either in your hands or close enough to be accessed quickly
According to Pew Research, about a third of Americans send more than 100 messages a day.
Almost all of them, almost all, are more likely to exchange messages with their friends than to watch them face to face.
There is an excellent article in the Atlantic magazine.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his children a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a particular subject without using observations.
And this said, "I've realized... "
I realized that being able to talk is probably one of the most failed skills we have failed to teach.
Children spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely have a chance to hone personal communication skills.
This question may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves: is there any skill in the 21st century that is more important than being able to maintain a coherent and confident conversation?
Now, I'm talking directly to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, and plumbers.
I talk to people I love. I talk to people I don't like,
I talk to some people with whom I disagree deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to use the next ten minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like looking into a person’s eye while talking, thinking in advance about interesting topics to discuss, looking and moving the head and smile to show that you are talking, repeating what you just heard or summarizing it.
I want you to forget all that.
Because that's stupid!
There’s no reason you know how to show attention if you’re really paying attention.
Now, I actually use the same skills in the professional interviews I do in normal life.
So, I’m going to teach you how to meet people, and this will actually help you learn how to become better interlocutors.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time and without getting bored, for God's sake, without offending anyone.
We've all had important past conversations.
We've done it before, and we know what it looked like.
The type of conversation you’re walking around with and feeling inspired, or with which you feel that you’ve communicated deeply or that you’ve been well understood.
There's no reason why most of your relationships are not like their predecessors.
So I have 10 basic rules that I'm going to explain to you, but honestly, if you just pick one and apply it, you're gonna have a great conversation.
Number one: Do not multitask.
And I'm not saying here to leave your cell phone or tablet or your car keys or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean, be present-minded.
Live the moment.
Don't think about the argument you had with your boss.
And don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don’t be half inside the conversation and half outside the conversation!
Don’t hold on to your opinion.
If you want to ask your opinion without giving any opportunity to respond or discuss, or increase and develop on your idea, write a blog.
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't let critics exist on my show: because they're really boring.
If they were conservative, you'd find them hating Obama, food stamps, abortion.
If they were liberals, they would hate big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
We can totally predict that.
And you don't want to be.
You need to enter every conversation on the assumption that you have something you want to learn.
As the famous therapist Scott Beck said, it requires proper listening by putting a breath aside.
Sometimes that means canceling your personal opinion.
If we sense this acceptance, the speaker will become less likely and more likely to open what he has and what is inside his mind to the listener.
Again, let's say you want to learn something.
As Bill Nye said, “Everyone you’ll meet knows something that you don’t know. "
And I put it that way: everyone is an expert on something.
Third, use open questions.
In this case, the reference is journalists.
Start your questions of what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complicated question, you will get an easy answer.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
You will reply to the most powerful word in the sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer will be "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
"Were you angry?" "Yeah, I was very angry."
Let them describe it, they are the ones who know.
Try asking them questions like, "How was that?"
"How did that feel?"
Because then they may have to stand up for a moment and think about it, and so you’ll get more enjoyable answers.
Fourth, walk with the current.
This means that thoughts will come to your mind and what you need is to make those thoughts come out of your brain.
I've often heard interviews where guests talk for a few minutes and then the host comes back and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere or has been answered in advance, and it's never been answered.
This means that the host stopped listening for two minutes because he thought of this brilliant question, and he was determined to say it.
We do the same.
We're sitting with someone we're talking to, and suddenly we remember that day when we met Hog Jackman at the cafe.
And stop listening.
Stories and ideas that will come to your mind,
And you need to let these ideas go and come.
If you don’t know, say you don’t know.
People on radio, especially on stations like NPR, are much more aware that they're recording, and so you find them more cautious about the things they claim to be experts in and the things they claim to be confident about.
Do it carefully.
Talking should not be cheap.
Don’t compare your experience to theirs.
If they're talking about losing a family member, don't talk about the time you lost a family member.
If they’re talking about some of the problems they face at work, don’t tell them how much you hate your work.
It's not the same, and it won't be.
Every experiment can be taken separately.
And most importantly, it's not about you.
You don’t need to talk and try to show how amazing you are or how you’ve suffered in the past.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking once about his IQ, and he said, “I have no idea. Because people who boast about their IQ are losers."
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Seventh, don’t try to give yourself back.
Because in it is a kind of self-smudgement and boredom, and we do it a lot.
Especially in business conversations or in conversations with our children, we want to reach a certain meaning, so we just reframe the words over and over again.
Don't do it.
Eighth: Stay away from weeds.
And what I mean frankly, people don't care about the years and the names, the dates, and all these details that you're struggling to remember.
They don't care about that and what they care about is you.
They care about what you love, and what things you have in common.
So forget these details and leave it.
Ninth: This is not the last point, but the most important point.
Listen up.
I may not be able to tell you about how many people have told you that listening can be the most important skill they can develop.
Buddha said, and I am here to make up his words, if your mouth is open, you will not learn.”
Calvin Coolidge said, “No one has lost their job because of their excessive listening.”
Why don't we hear each other?
First, we prefer to speak.
When I speak, I am under control.
And I don't need to hear anything I'm not interested in.
I am the center of attention.
And I can boost my identity.
But there is another reason: our attention is distracted.
The average person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can hear 500 words per minute.
So our minds are busy and filled with 275 words like that.
I also know that it takes energy and effort to pay attention to someone, and if you can’t do it, you’re not actually talking.
You two are screaming and barely saying some sentences in the same place.
So we have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it beautifully.
He said: “Most of us don’t listen to understand.
But he only listens with the intention of replying. "
Another rule is the tenth rule, which is the shortening of speech.
[Good conversation is like a short skirt. They are short enough to bring sight, and long enough to cover the nakedness -- my sister] all of this boils down to the same basic concept, which is: be interested in others.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was a certain ritual in my house.
People would come to talk to my grandparents, and after they were gone, my mom would come to us and say, "Do you know who that was?"
She was Miss America's runner-up.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a famous Russian baller."
So I grew up with this assumption that everyone has something special hidden from them.
And frankly, I think that's what made me the best hostess.
And that is, I try as much as I can to keep my mouth shut, my mind open, and I'm always ready to be amazing, and I've never been disappointed.
And you have to do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly be prepared to be amazed.
Thanks.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams. I'm a hero.
I won medals in three different sports and in the national games in Canada, I played internationally in basketball and I am proud to have represented Canada globally.
I train five days a week in basketball and speed skating, working with top-level coaches and mentally performing consultants to be in my best sport.
By the way, all during the Special Olympics.
Does that change your idea of me and my accomplishments?
The world like me is not a hero.
Not long ago, people like me were outcasts and hiding out of sight.
There have been a lot of changes since the start of the Special Olympics in 1968, but in many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to others everywhere.
People use insulting words in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
Use the word "late" or "late" in a humiliating way.
They don't care how much my pain and my friends' pain.
I don't want you to think that being here because I'm a humanitarian issue.
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way people with intellectual disabilities are treated, or, more often than not, how they do not pay attention to them at all.
Did you know that the World Games were held this year?
I was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in Los Angeles.
There were more than 62,000 spectators who followed the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSN and ESPN.
You know what happened?
What comes to your mind when you see someone like me?
I'm here today to challenge you to look at us in an equal way.
The Special Olympics make a change in the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and in the perceptions of followers.
For those who are not familiar with it, the Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Seated Olympics and the Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality sports mobile programs for people with intellectual disabilities that can make changes to their lives and ideas.
This activity has changed my life and the lives of many.
It changed the way the world looks at those with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and mental disability.
As I got older, I played hockey up to 12 years old,
The older you get, the harder it feels to connect with everyone, and you're angry and frustrated.
I didn’t play any sports for a while, I didn’t have many friends and I felt like I was abandoned and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hiding out of the sight of society.
It didn’t come to their minds that they could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the physical fitness of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion that lack of opportunity to participate has caused fitness suffering.
Many have questioned the extent to which people with intellectual disabilities benefit from fitness programs and opportunities behind sports competitions.
But pioneers such as Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founders of the Special Olympics, have been steadfast, and Special Olympics players have proven themselves more than four and a half million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous, because I was young, shy, insecure, and I didn’t have many friends.
When you got there, everyone was cheering, working to support you and letting you know how to be yourself without making any judgments.
I am now a basketball player and skier who has competed in several regional and national competitions, and this year he was able to join the Summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first Canadian to join the basketball team and compete at the level of the World Games.
I am one of more than four million five hundred athletes from all over the world, and I have heard many similar stories.
Being athletes in the Special Olympics, we are entitled to regain our pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics address critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than ordinary men, and that women with intellectual disabilities are 20 years younger than those without a disability.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by being lively and participating in sport.
The trainers taught us dietary and health rules.
Special Olympics also provide free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with a direct doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 Summer World Games, I played with members of my Canadian team against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian basketball team underwent a health check for World Games athletes, with 7 out of 10 players receiving free headphones and being able to hear clearly for the first time.
The change they had was amazing.
They were more enthusiastic, happy and confident, because their coach was able to communicate with them with words.
And they got emotional because they could hear the sound of basketball, the whistle, the fans in the stands -- that sounds like a given.
The Special Olympics do not make a change for athletes only.
They also change their lives off the field.
This year, research has shown that nearly half of U.S. adults don’t even know someone with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans who don’t have personal contact with people with intellectual disabilities are less acceptable to the other.
Then there are those hurtful and humiliating words that prove that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to many people.
People use it like it's just a passing word or a path to humiliation.
I mentioned in the form of tweets more than nine million times last year, it was very painful for me and for the four million and five hundred athletes around the world.
Not many people think it is an insult, but it is.
As my fellow sporting fellow and global envoy John Franklin Stevens wrote in an open letter to political critics who used it as an insult, “Join us one day at the Special Olympics.
Let's see if you leave and nothing has changed in you."
This year, at the 2015 Summer World Games, people stood in a long line for hours to attend the weightlifting competition finals.
Everyone stood up only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, a huge Newfoundland, lifted 655 pounds, and raised 611 pounds in a squat position. This sets a new record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among all Newfoundland athletes – not just in the Special Olympics, but in the whole weightlifting sport.
Jackie was a bright star in Los Angeles, and was impressed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, a few people with intellectual disabilities thought they could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Amphitheater to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games and encourage athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hiding out of sight, we would get encouragement and celebrate us.
Special Olympics teach athletes confidence and pride in themselves.
The Special Olympics provided a lesson to the world that people with special needs deserve respect and inclusion.
I now have my dreams and ambitions associated with this sport, good coaches, respect and dignity, good health, and I practice as a personal trainer.
I'm not the kind of person who hides and is being bullied, and here I am having a conversation at TED.
The world has become a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but the road is still long.
So the next time you meet someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you can see their abilities.
The next time someone next to you uses those mean words, please tell them the pain you leave behind.
Please consider participating in the Special Olympics.
I'd like to continue with one last thought.
As Nelson Mandela said, “Sport has the potential to make a difference in the world.”
The Special Olympics is transforming the world by making changes in four million and five hundred athletes and allowing us to be confident, to meet friends, to make no prejudices, to feel that feeling and to be heroes.
Thank you so much.
You may not have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Ura, Nigeria.
But I know they're the most unusual place on Earth.
In hospitals there, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists who are quietly fighting one of humanity’s most deadly dangers for years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
A severe diet can often cause fatal.
But these people are putting their lives at risk every day to protect people in their communities, and in doing so, they protect us all.
But one of the most unusual things I've learned about them on one of my first visits there in a few years is that they start every morning -- these challenges, extraordinary days in the front lines -- by singing.
They get together and show their joy.
They show their souls.
And over the years, year after year when I visit them and visit me, I meet with them and I sing and we write and we love this, because this reminds us that we are not here to pursue science together, we are linked together by our common humanity.
And this, of course, as you can imagine, has become very important, even essential, as something for the beginning of change.
This changed a big deal in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This is the first epidemic in West Africa, along with the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
That was scary, scary for all of us.
We were actually suspects for some time, Lhasa and Ebola were spreading more than expected, and we said that it could one day come to Neema.
And so some members immediately left my team and joined Dr. Homar Khan and his team there, and we prepared a diagnosis to be able to get partial allergy tests to catch Ebola if it came across the border and within Sierra Leone.
We had already prepared these tests for the Lassa virus, we knew how to do this, the team was great.
We just had to give them the tools and the place to look for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On 23 May 2014, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of the hospital, and the team performed these important molecular tests and identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an extraordinary work that was done.
They were able to diagnose the condition immediately, to treat the patient safely and start a tracking contact to find out what was happening.
I stopped something.
But by that day, the epidemic had broken out for months?
In hundreds of cases, he's already overwhelmed all previous epidemics.
I come to Sierra Leone not as an individual case, but as a big wave.
We had to work with the global community, with the Department of Health, with Kenema. Let's start facing those cases, where he brought in the following week 31, then 92, and then 147 cases -- all coming to Kneema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that can cope with this.
And we've worked around the clock trying to do our best, trying to help these people, trying to get attention, but we've also done something else that's simple.
From that sample we took from the patient's blood to discover Ebola, we can get it out, clearly.
The other thing we can do is, actually, we stop it chemically, put it in a box, and then we send it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent him to Boston, where my team works.
We worked around the clock, dividing the work on us in shifts, day after day, and quickly produced 99 genomes for the Ebola virus.
This is a chart - the viral genome is the blueprint.
We all have one.
He says everything inside of us, he says a lot of information.
The result of such a work is simple and powerful.
We can actually take these 99 different viruses, watch them and compare them, and we can see, actually, a comparison of three genes, and this has happened before and spread from Guinea, we can show the beginning of the outbreak in a rich months ago, once for humans, and then I move from one human to another.
Now, that's very important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is to keep track.
We can also see that the virus, during human-transmission, mutates.
And every shift of this is very important, because of the diagnosis, the vaccinations, the treatments that we use, they're all based on this genetic sequence, basically -- that's what it's leading.
And so the global health experts have to respond, they have to evolve, to examine everything they've been doing.
But the way science worked, and the place where I was at that moment, that I had the information, I could work in a silo for a lot of months, a lot of months, analyze the information carefully, by taking the paper forward for publication, ordering through several attempts back and forth, and finally when the paper was published, we could disclose the information.
That's how the situation works right now.
Well, that wouldn't have been good at this point, would it?
We had friends on the front lines, and for us it was clear that what we needed was help, a lot of help.
And so the first thing we did was, as soon as the sequence came out of the machines, we posted it online.
We spread it to the whole world and we said, "Help us."
Help came.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from all over the world, impressed by the information outside there and its publication.
Some of the greatest virus followers in the world are suddenly part of our society.
We've been working together in this virtual road, sharing, regular calls, communication, we're trying to track the virus minute by minute, to find ways to stop it.
There are a lot of ways we can be communities like this.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic began to spread globally, would arrive abroad to learn, to participate, to be fused.
Everyone wants to play a role.
The amount of human capacity out there was fantastic, and the internet brought us all together.
And you can imagine this instead of being afraid of each other, that's all we said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together, let's make this happen."
But the problem was that the information that we all use, Internet search, is very limited to do what we need to do.
So many opportunities were lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the epidemic in Kenema, we'd have recorded 106 cases of patients, and again we've done this publicly available to the world.
And in our labs, we've been able to show that you can take the 106 records, and we can train the computer to predict and predict Ebola patients with almost 100% accuracy.
And we made an app that could publish this, to make this available to health care workers in the field.
But 106 is not enough to make it strong, to be installed.
We are waiting for more information to release it.
That information has not yet come.
We're still waiting, maneuvering away, in the silos instead of working together.
And just-- we can't accept this.
You, all of you, can't accept that.
It's our life on the line.
And in fact, actually, we've lost a lot of lives from a lot of health care workers, including my dear colleagues, five colleagues of Mbalou Fonny, Alex Mogg Boy, Dr. Homar Khan, Alice Kofama and Mohammed Fula.
These are just five of the many health care workers in and around Kenema who died while the world waits and while we all worked, quietly and alone.
So, Ebola, like all dangers to humanity, is a fireplace of mistrust, confusion and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight among us, the virus thrives.
But not like other dangers to humanity, Ebola is the only one in which we are all the same.
We're all in that war together.
Ebola on someone's doorstep could soon be on our doorstep.
And so in this place with the same weaknesses, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we can work together with joy.
My graduate student was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I discovered the word "Kenema," the hospital where we work and the city we work in Sierra Leone, named after Klimt Mendy means "purity like a river, transparent and open to the public. "
This was very deep for us, because without knowing this, we always felt that it was a tribute to the people in Kenema where we were working, we had to work openly, we had to share and work together.
And we should have done this.
We all have to demand this for ourselves and for the others -- to be open to each other when there's another pandemic, to fight in this war together.
Because this isn't the first Ebola epidemic, and it's not gonna be the last, and there's a lot of other microbes out there waiting, like the Lhasa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a million-dollar city, it could start there.
It can be something that travels through the air.
It could even be published intentionally.
And I know it's scary, I understand this, but I also know, and this experience you'll see, that we have the technology and we have the ability to succeed on this thing, to succeed on this and be the saying on viruses.
But we can only if we do it together and if we do it with fun.
And that's for Dr. Khan and all those who gave their lives in the first ranks in this war with us always, to be with them in the war always,
And let's not let the world know the destruction caused by a single virus, but it's lit by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
