Well, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybkzinsky.
She is a paleontologist who specializes in exhuming very old dead organisms.
Natalia Rypkzynski: Yes, someone calls me "Doctor of Dead Beings."
Latif Nasser: I think it's particularly interesting because of the places to dig for these things, towards the top of the Arctic Circle in the distant Canadian tundra.
On a summer day in 2006, it was at a digging site called the "Camel Shrine", which lies less than 10 degrees from latitude away from the attractive North Pole.
NATALIA: Really, it won't sound so exciting, because you spend the whole day walking with your backpack, GPS, and notebook picking up anything that might look like a fossil.
Latif Nasser: At one point, I noticed something.
Natalia: Something rusty, kind of rust-colored, the size of the palm of my hand.
It was lying on the roof.
Latif Nasser: At first I thought it was just a piece of wood, because such things were found in that place by -- prehistoric plant fragments.
But that night, on the way back to the camp...
Natalia:... I took out the lens, carefully checked it and realized that it did not carry traces of tree rings.
Maybe something has been carefully preserved, but really resembles ...
Bones.
Latif Nasser: Over the next four years, I went to the site over and over again, eventually collecting 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them really small.
Natalia: Not a big group. It can fit a small ziplock bag.
Nasser Latif: And I tried to put them together like a ripped puzzle.
But it was challenging.
Natalia: It was smashed into several small pieces, I tried to use sand and putty, but it didn't look good.
Eventually, we used a three-dimensional scanner.
Latif Nasser: Oh! Natalia: Right?
Latif Nasser: Doing this by default turns out to be the easiest way.
NATALIA: It's kind of magic when it fits together.
Nice: How confident you were doing it as it should, that you collected it right?
Is there a possibility to put them together in another way and get a parakeet, for example?
NATALIA: No. No, we got this.
Latif Nasser: What I got, I discovered, was the shin, the leg bone, and specifically, it belonged to the family of mammals with hoofs, something like a cow or a sheep.
But it could not have been one of them.
It was very big.
NATALIA: The size of this thing was enormous, it was a big animal.
Latif Nasser: Which animal can it be?
She presented one of the fragments to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea about it.
Natalia: We took a saw, we made a hole in it, and it smelled interesting.
Latif Nasser: It smelled like burnt meat.
It was a smell that Natalia knew by cutting skulls in the anatomy laboratory: collagen.
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.
Usually, after many years, it collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic was like a natural refrigerator and saved it.
But a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and met a colleague named Mike Buckley who was explaining a new process called collagen fingerprinting.
It turns out that different varieties have slightly different collagen structures, if you get a collagen composition from unknown bones, you can compare them with well-known varieties, and who knows, you may get a match.
So she sent one of them, FedEx.
NATALIA: yes, you want to track that. It's kind of important.
. Latif Nasser: He processed them, comparing them with 37 known species of mammals of our time.
And he got a match.
The 3.5 million-year-old bone found by Natalia from the Upper Arctic turned out to be...
Camel.
NATALIA: And it comes to me, what? That's amazing -- if true.
Latif Nasser: They examined all the shrapnel, and they got the same result.
However, based on the size of the bones discovered, this means that these camels are 30 percent larger than the camels found in modern times.
This camel will be about 9 feet long and weigh about half a ton.
Yes
Natalia found a giant camel from the Arctic.
Now, when you hear the word "camel," what might come to mind is one of these, the two-humped camel from the Middle East and Central Asia.
But chances are that the picture in your mind is that of one of these, the lone-humped camel, the intrinsic desert creature -- it expands in hot sandy places like the Middle East and the desert, with an old, large-sized hump for storing water for long desert trips, and has big, wide feet to help it climb the dunes.
So how did one end up here in the Upper Arctic?
Well, scientists have long known, as it turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that beauty is actually of American origin.
They first appeared here.
For about 40 of the 45 million years of beauty, camels can be found in North America alone, about 20 different species, and maybe more.
NATALIA: If you put it in a group, will it look different?
Latif Nasser: Yes, you will have different sizes.
Some will have a very long neck, so they actually look like a giraffe.
Latif Nasser: Some have a nose, like crocodiles.
Natalia: The primitive ones were really small, almost like rabbits.
Latif Nasser: What? A beauty the size of a rabbit?
Natalia: the old ones.
So you probably won't be able to recognize them.
Latif Nasser: Oh my God, I want a camel-rabbit pet.
NATALIA: I know, wouldn't that be great?
Latif Nasser: About three or seven million years ago, one group of camels headed towards South America, where they became lama and alpaca, and another group crossed the Beringia land bridge towards Asia and Africa.
Then before the end of the last ice age, camels in North America became extinct.
Scientists already know all this, but it's still hard to explain how Natalia found one in the far north.
Low temperature, the pole is the opposite of the desert.
Let's be fair now, three and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, warmer than it is now.
They would have been northern forests, more like Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, like, the length of winter will be six months as the puddles freeze.
Blizzards may strike.
The night extends for 24 consecutive hours.
Like, how so... How?
How did one of the stars of the desert manage to survive and live in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues thought they had the answer.
Which is kind of cool.
What if the features we perceive make the camel adapt in places like the desert, actually evolved to help it cope with winter?
What if his wide feet were supposed to set foot not on sand, but snow, like ski boots?
What if that hump -- and it was a surprise to me, doesn't contain water, it contains fat -- there to help the camel cope with the six months of winter. When food is scarce?
Later, long after crossing the bridge, did she adapt the winter features to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, a hump can be good for beauty in hot climates because all the fat is in one place, such as a fat backpack, which means you don't need all this insulating material in the rest of the body.
So it helps to dissipate heat easier.
This is a crazy idea, it seems like proof that the idyllic nature of the desert could be evidence of the ancient Arctic.
I'm not the right person to tell you this story.
Others have said it's a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or a future key to climate change.
But I like it for completely different reasons.
For me, this story is all about us, about how we see the world and how that has changed.
I received training as a historian.
And I knew that, in fact, a lot of historians as well.
They made sense of the past.
Tell us the history of the universe and the planet we live in.
As a historian, you start with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
NATALIA: We make up stories and stick to them, like a camel in the desert, right?
This is a great story! Perfectly adapted to it.
Obviously, she lived there forever.
Nasser: But at any moment, some evidence can be discovered.
Learning a few little things can force you to reframe everything you thought you knew.
Like, in this case, a scientist found one piece of what I thought was wood, and because of that, science had an entirely new theory that was totally contrary to what this creature looks like the way it is.
For me, that completely changed the way I think about sentences.
Transformed from a silly creature suitable only for one specific environment, to be a traveler in a world that happens to exist in the desert, it can end up almost anywhere.
I present to you "Azuri".
"Azuri", hello, how are you?
Well, here, I got one of these for you.
The Azzurri enjoys a break from his ordinary disturbance in the music hall of Radio City.
It's not just a joke.
Anyway -- but, Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is vivid.
It requires a willingness to adjust, usually imagining.
Isn't it, Azuri?
And that we are only a small piece away from seeing the world in a new form.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how bad they are.
Today I would like to talk to you about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
I would first like to take you back to a cold night in the neighborhood of 2011 that had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting in a local bar outside Columiba University. Where I studied computer science and neuroscience, I was with a fellow student in the midst of an interesting conversation about the ability of holograms to replace computers one day.
And as we were going to get to the most interesting part of the conversation, his hat, of course, lit up.
He pulled it towards him, looked at it, and started printing.
Then he started forcing his eyes to look at me and said, "I complete my full focus."
But of course his eyes were glued to the hathaf, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar I noticed another student holding his phone. This time he was with a group.
He was browsing the photos on Instagram, and those kids were laughing hysterically.
And this duality between my miserable feeling and their sense of happiness about the same technology. It made me think.
The more I looked at it, the more I realized that the negative factor in the equation was not digital information, it was simply the position of the screen that separated me from my friend and brought these kids together.
You see, they were gathered around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social knowledge telling stories about the campfire.
And that's exactly the role of tools, I think.
Its role lies in extending the capabilities of our bodies.
And I think computers today do the opposite.
Whether you're emailing your spouse, composing music, or comforting a friend, you're doing it all the same way.
You bend over those rectangles, pressing buttons, menus, and more rectangles.
And it occurred to me that this is the wrong way, I think we can use a machine closer to nature.
We have to use machines that bring our work back to life.
We need to use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend rather than reduce our perceptions.
Circumstances wanted me to have such a machine with me.
It's called meta-2.
Let's give it a try.
I see the audience right in front of me, and I see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we're going to see a spectral picture, a very realistic spectral image that appears in front of me, in front of these glasses that I'm wearing now.
This can be anything we shop for or learn from, and I can use and move my hands with ease.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll be back to this in a moment.
Now, if you're like me, your mind must be teetering from the possibilities of what this technology will allow us to do, let's look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was to simplify a building in three-dimensional space instead of using these two-dimensional diagrams.
She touches the drawings at this moment and chooses an interior.
All of this was filmed via the GoPro camera through our own glasses.
This second use is special to me, it's the professor's vitreous brain representation project, thanks to the University of California, San Francisco.
As a student of neuroscience, I always dream of being able to learn and memorize all these complex brain structures with a real machine, which enables me to touch and manipulate different brain structures.
What you're seeing is called augmented reality, but to me it's related to a more complex story -- the story of how we can extend our body's capabilities with digital devices instead of doing the opposite.
Now...
I think that in the next few years, humanity will go through a transformation.
We'll start by putting a full layer of digital information into practice.
Imagine for a moment what this might mean for novelists, painters, brain surgeons, interior designers and perhaps everyone present today.
And what I think we need to do as a community. It is trying and making an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, rather than making our reality a game or scattering digital information into it.
And that's my passion.
I want to share a little secret with you.
In five years -- that's not the smallest device -- after about five years, they'll all look like glass strips on our eyes showing spectral images.
And just as we don't care which hardware we buy -- we buy it because of the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of making a mental operating system.
And it's important to do it the right way, because we've probably lived inside these things at least all our lives with the Windows graphical interface.
And I don't know about you, but living inside Windows scares me.
To isolate the façade most famous from infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design principles rather than letting a group of designers fight around it in the meeting room.
The principle we all aspire to is called the "least resistant neural pathway."
At every turn, we connect the mental operating system with our mind for the first time with the specifics of our brains.
In other words, we're trying to make a computer that's easy to use.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
These are the first three design principles we employ in this new user experience.
The first and most important principle is that you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract. It requires your brain to work harder to decipher it.
It works against the less resistant neural pathway.
While in augmented reality you can of course put the spectral image of the TED platform here, and the spectral image of your email on this side of the office, and your positional memory has evolved to be found.
You can put on the Tesla model that you want to buy -- or whatever my legal team asked me to put before the show.
Great, your brain knows exactly how to retrieve it.
The second principle we call "touch to see."
What do children do when they see something that interests them?
They try to reach him and touch him.
And that's exactly how a natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system gets a fundamental boost from what we call proprioception -- it's the sense of perception of internal organs.
So by touching our work directly, we'll not only be able to control it better, but we'll also understand it more deeply.
Hence the idea of "touch to see".
But it is not enough to try things ourselves.
We are social primates.
What brings me to the third principle, the anthropomorphic fire of the camp from our first story.
Our mirror neuron cell indicates that we can communicate better with each other and our work if we can see each other's faces and hands in three dimensions.
If you look at the video behind me, you see two Meta users playing with the same spectral image, communicating with the eyes, and communicating around this object, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's try this again with neuroscience in mind.
So, our preferred operating system, the mental operating system.
I'm going to now take a step forward and take these glasses and leave them here by the desk.
I am present with you at this moment, we are in contact.
My local memory is activated and I can take it and bring it towards me, reminding me that I am the rioting system.
And my sense of proprioception works, and I can blow these glasses into millions of pieces and touch the sensor that is now scanning my fingerprint.
But seeing things alone is not enough, after a second my partner will make a three-dimensional call -- ?
How's it going?
I can see it in front of me in three dimensions.
And it's very realistic.
Thank you.
This will replace the anthers according to the mirror neuron cell in the not too distant future.
How are things like?
: Great we are live.
:, I give the audience the gift of the spectral brain that we saw in the video earlier.
This will not only change the hoops, but also the way we collaborate.
Oh thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
: This is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011. The future of computers is not present in one of these screens.
It's here, inside all of us.
If there's one idea I want to pitch to you, it's that the natural machine isn't a fantasy of the future, it's here in 2016.
That's why all the hundred people at Meta, including the management team, the executives, the designers and the engineers -- and before the TED2017 conference, we're going to throw away our computer screens and replace them with a truly natural machine.
Oh thank you.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thanks everyone.
: Tell me one thing. Because I've made a few presentations on augmented reality over the past year or so.
There is a debate among technological experts. His theme is do we really see something real on the screen?
There's a field of view issue, in a way technology shows us a wider view than you can see with glasses.
Was what we saw real?
:For sure.
Not only that, but we took extra precautions to shoot it through the lenses with the GoPro camera in the various shots we saw.
We want to simulate the real-life experience we see through glasses, without any tricks.
: Thank you for showing us that. I appreciate it, thank you very much.
I am from the most liberal, tolerant, advanced spot in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
She grew up in a great family from Seattle.
My mother was an artist, my father was a university professor. I am really grateful to them for raising me, because I have always felt completely comfortable planning my life exactly what suits me.
In fact, I took a path other than the one my parents had planned.
When I was 19 I dropped out of college -- I left it, I was kicked out, say what you will.
Then I took a path as a professional in playing the French trumpet which was my life's dream.
Theatrical music was played throughout America and Europe, and for a few years I toured with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
At the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
How great is life.
And you know, my parents never complained.
They supported me along the way.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, on break for a decade."
And -- and yet there was a rough conversation about my lifestyle that I would like to tell you.
I was 27, I was coming home from Barcelona, I visited my father for Christmas, I was cooking dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
It was quiet, very quiet.
Something was wrong.
And I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
She replied, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
And I said, "What?" I mean, what's the matter, now?
She replied: I want you to be completely honest with me: Were you voting Republicans?
Well, the truth is, I wasn't a politician, I was just a French trumpeter.
But I was fond of discoveries, and they had revealed it, and that caused some confusion.
As you can see I was passionate about capitalism, I want to tell you why that was.
It seems to be my constant interest believe it or not, in poverty.
You see, when I was young, and grew up in Seattle, I remember the first time, I saw real poverty.
We were a low-middle class family, but of course that is not real poverty.
This is never close.
The first time I saw poverty, the face of poverty, when I was six or seven years old, in my early seventies.
Like many of you, it was an irregular, vulgar example.
It was a photograph in the National Geographic Journal of a child my age in East Africa, with flies on his face and a swollen belly.
He wasn't going to escape his inevitable fate, I was aware of it but I couldn't do anything.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, but any picture like it.
It provided the West with the acute poverty that exists around the world.
Well, that vision followed me until I grew up and went to school and went out and came back and started my family.
What happened to that child?
Or for people like him around the world?
And I started studying, even though I wasn't in school, looking for the answer: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Has their condition gotten worse? Have you improved? Or what?
I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share that with you.
You see -- most Americans think that poverty is worse than it has been since we were kids, since they saw that vision.
If you ask Americans, "Is poverty around the world worse or better?" 70 percent of people would respond that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
But this is the truth.
This is the discovery that changed my thinking.
From 1970 to the present, the proportion of the world's population living in hunger levels lives on a dollar or less a day, of course, with the necessary adjustment to calculate inflation, this percentage has decreased by 80 percent.
There has been an 80% reduction in the worst poverty in the world since I was a child.
I didn't even know about it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
This is something we should celebrate.
It is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in the history of humanity, and it has happened in our lifetimes.
When I found out, I wondered what enabled us to do that? How did it become possible?
If you don't know why? You won't be able to do that again.
If you want to do this again and lift two billion people out of poverty, that's what we've been talking about since I was a child, at least two billion of those, our brothers and sisters, were lifted out of poverty.
I want another two billion so I wanted to know why.
And I started looking for the answer.
It was not a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from economists left, right and center.
And here we are.
These are the reasons.
These are 5 reasons why two billion brothers and sisters have been lifted out of poverty since I was a child.
First: globalization.
Second: Free Trade.
Third: Property rights.
Fourth: The rule of law.
Fifth: Creating projects.
This was due to the free economy system that spread around the world after 1970.
Right now, I'm not naïve.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect, I know that free enterprise is not all we need to build a better world.
But that's great.
And beyond politics.
That's what I learned. That's what I discovered.
Capitalism is not only accumulation.
Because at its best, ambition, which is what a lot of people talk about above this platform, ambition that comes from dreams and is an integral part of the free economy system.
We have to share it with more people.
Now, I want to share with you a second discovery that is linked to the first discovery that I believe will contribute to development not only around the world, but here at home.
The best quote I've ever heard to summarize the ideas I just said about lifting people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
It has lifted billions of people out of poverty."
Who said that?
It looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
This is wrong.
It was President Barack Obama who said it.
Why do I know that by heart?
Because he told me that.
Insanity.
And I said, "Hallelujah."
But more than that, I said, "What an opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
That was during an event we were doing on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
I thought that this was the solution to the big problem America faces today. The what?
These ideas, liberals and conservatives, revolve around them to help the people who need us most.
Right now, I won't have to tell anyone in this room that we are in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world related to political polarization.
It has risen to critical crisis levels.
This is unpleasant and not true.
There was an article last year in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious newspapers published in the West.
An article was published in 2014 about the inconsistency of political action.
What is this? This is what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your faith is based on love but that of your opponent is based on hate.
This is common in global conflict.
This is expected to be seen between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
What the authors of this article found was in America today, where most Republicans and Democrats suffer from the asymmetry of political action.
The majority of people today who are politically active in our country believe that they are motivated by love while the other side is motivated by hatred.
Think about this. Think about this.
Most people say, "You know, my creed is based on empathy, I want to help people, but other people are evil and they're on the lookout for me."
You cannot develop as a society when you suffer from this kind of inconsistency.
That's impossible.
How do we find a solution to this?
Well, first, let's be frank: there are differences.
Let's not underestimate the differences. This would be kind of naïve.
There is a lot of good research on this.
One of my old TED lecturers is my friend Jonathan Heidt.
He is a doctor of psychology at New York University.
He conducts studies on the faith, values and ethics of several people to discover how they differ.
He has demonstrated, for example, that conservatives and liberals have different significance in what they think is important.
For example, John Hayedt proved that liberals care 59 percent more about poverty than they care about economic freedom.
Conservatives care more about economic freedom than they care about poverty.
Contradictory differences aren't they?
We will never agree. Wrong.
This is the diversity in which our strength lies.
You remember what brought the poor out of poverty.
It was this obsession with poverty, linked to the way economic freedom spread around the world.
We need each other, or in other words, if we want to help people and lift another two billion out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Hmmm.
How are we going to do this?
It's confusing, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
Lots of it on this platform.
Creating social projects yes. For sure. Distinctive.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, ethical and responsible way. Yes, yes.
But do you know what we really need?
We need a new day with a flexible ideology.
We should be less predictable.
Isn't it?
Do you feel that your faith is becoming predictable?
Rather traditional?
Do you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economies, on the Yempen, on the conservatives, you're always talking about taxes, laws, big government.
On the left, liberals, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality.
Correct? These things are important now, very important to me. Very important to you.
But when it comes to saving people who are starving and need us, these will distract from them.
We need to come together and agree on the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best means at our disposal, and this can be achieved when conservatives recognize their need for liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free trade.
This is diversity where the future strength of this country lies, if we choose it.
So how are we going to do it, how are we going to do it together?
I've got some rules of action, not only for you, but for me as well.
First of all. The first rule of action: remember, it's not good enough to tolerate those who disagree with you.
This is not good enough.
We must remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these means.
Now, what are you going to do? And how will you put it out?
Where does this begin? It starts here.
You know, all of us in this room now are blessed.
We are blessed by the people who hear us.
We are blessed with well-being. We are blessed to drive.
When others hear us, with this kind of unexpected ideology, people can listen.
Maybe progress can be made towards that point.
This number one. The number is two.
Number two: I ask you and I ask myself to be that person who transcends barriers, the mysterious person, who is difficult to classify.
If you are a conservative person, be that conservative person who always strives around poverty and the moral imperative to be a warrior of poverty.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets to address our problems when they are used responsibly.
If we do that, we will have two things.
First, we should start working on the next two billion and be the solution that we have seen so often in the past and need to see more of it in the future. That's what it's going to be like.
Secondly, we may be able to change the terrible sacred ideological war we suffer in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, perhaps, just perhaps, we'll realize that our biggest differences aren't really that different.
Thank you.
When I was in college. My major was in government work, which meant that I had to write a lot of papers,
Now, when any average student writes a piece of paper, his schedule looks almost like this.
As you can see. The work is slow at first, but you get done during the first week enough to make you see the heavy days coming looking productive and nice.
And I wish I could do this the same,
This is how the plan will be.
I'll start writing the schedule to get started, then it's time to write. And I end up like this!
And this happens on every paper I write.
Until I was asked to write my 90-page graduation thesis, a paper that we are supposed to work on all year!
And for a paper like this, my usual schedule of work was not an option.
Because the project was so huge.
I started planning the project, and decided that the schedule should look like something like this.
This is how the year will pass.
I will start with easy and light work, then I will increase the effort a little in the middle of the year, and at the end of the year I will work as hard as I have. It will be very easy as climbing the ladder, degree by degree.
How difficult can climbing stairs be?
Not a big deal, right?
But the funniest thing happened to me.
in the first months,
She came and went quickly, and I couldn't do anything.
So I decided to change my plan a little bit.
Then... But the middle of the year actually passed quickly, and I didn't write a word. So now you're here!
Shrink the two months to one month Then to two weeks.
And one day I woke up, and there were only three days left to deliver!! And I haven't written a word yet, so I did the only thing I could, I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, and I went on for two whole days without sleep. And humans should not stay up for two days without sleep, I rushed running to the university, in slow motion I handed the paper on the exact date!
I thought I had accomplished everything.
A week later, I got a call, it was a call from the university.
They asked, "Are you Tim Orbin?"
I replied, "Yes."
They said, "We should discuss with you regarding your thesis."
I said, "Okay."
They said... "It's the best thesis we've seen in our lives!"
This didn't really happen,
It was a very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
No, no, it was too bad.
Anyway, today I am a writer and blogger on the Internet.
I write in a blog called "Wait but why?"
Two years ago I decided to blog about procrastination and postponement
My actions have always puzzled the non-procrastinators around me and why I postpone my work, so I wanted to explain to these people and to the world, what is going on in the heads of those who procrastinate and postpone their work, and why we are like this.
I had a theory that the minds of procrastinators are really different from other people.
And to test this, I found a lab that allowed me to use an MRI machine to image my brain and the brain of another man who doesn't postpone his work so that I can compare them.
And I brought the pictures with me to see them today by yourselves
I want you now to take a closer look to see if there is a difference.
I know not all of you are experts, and it's not clear but just look, okay?
So here's a brain image that doesn't postpone,
And now.
Here is a picture of my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains contain but the mind of the Massouf also contains
Now, what does this mean for the souf?
It means that everything is fine until this happens.
Man: "This is the perfect time to get work done" Monkey: "No!" Then he will do something useful and productive. But the monkey doesn't like the plan, so the monkey takes the wheel and says, "Why don't we read the whole Wikipedia page about the Nancy and Tonya scandal because I just remembered that this happened!"
Then.. Then we'll go to the fridge to see if anything in it has changed since 10 minutes.
Next, we'll enter a YouTube spiral that starts with videos about Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends a very long time later with interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
Monkey: "All this will take time, and there is no space to do anything today.
"Sorry!"
Now, what's going on here!
This monkey doesn't look like someone you want to lead behind the rudder.
He lives entirely in the present moment,
He has no memory of the past and no knowledge of the future. He cares only about two things: "easy and fun."
In the animal world, this goes perfectly.
If you're a dog, and you've done nothing but easy and fun, you're successful by all standards!
And for monkeys, humans are just another type of animal.
They eat, sleep and multiply. Which would be normal in primitive times.
But, if you don't notice, we're not in those times.
We are in a sophisticated and civilized time and the monkey does not know the meaning of that.
And that's why it's in our head, which gives us abilities that no other animal can,
We can imagine the future,
We can see the whole picture
And we can make long-term plans.
The decision maker takes all this into account,
And he wants us to do only what seems right and logical to do now.
Sometimes doing something seems logical and fun at the same time, such as attending dinner, going to sleep, or having fun in free time.
That's why there is an overlap between the logical and the enjoyable.
Sometimes they get along the line,
Other times, it makes more sense to work on something difficult and unenjoyable for the greatest benefit.
And here the conflict occurs.
For the souf, this conflict always ends in the same way, making him spend most of his time in the orange zone, a fun and easy area completely detached from the logic circle.
I call it .
Now, a place that you all know well .
A place where leisure activities occur at a time that is not actually free time.
The fun you have in me is not real fun, because it is not deserved at all and the atmosphere around you is full of guilt, unhappiness, anxiety and self-hatred, all the beautiful feelings of the worshippers.
And the question when the monkey is behind the wheel is: How does the masouf move himself to the blue zone, an area where things that are less fun and easy but much more important happen.
Well, it turns out that the one who postpones his work has a guardian king, someone who always watches him and looks at him in his darkest and darkest moments. A person called
Now he's asleep most of the time. But he wakes up suddenly, when any deadline is too close or there is a risk of embarrassment in front of people or losing a job, or any frightening consequence.
And the most important thing is that it is the only thing that scares the monkey.
Now, this monster has become connected to my life recently, because TED conference officials contacted me six months ago and invited me to speak on it.
Of course I said, "Yes, it's always been my dream to
I'm speaking at TED in the past.
In the midst of all this enthusiasm, the decision-maker was thinking something else.
He was saying, "Are we clear about what we just agreed to?
Do we know what will happen one day in the future?
We have to sit down and prepare the speech immediately."
The monkey said: I completely agree with you, but what do you think we open Google Maps, zoom in on the bottom of India and explore it for two and a half hours until we reach the top of India, in order to educate ourselves about this country."
That's what we did that day.
6 months turned into 4, then 2, then one month. TED decided to announce the speakers at the conference,
When I opened the website, I found a picture of my face staring at me.
And guess who woke up?
He's starting to lose his mind. In just a few seconds, the system turned into chaos.
And the monkey got up - remember, the monkey is afraid of the monster of panic - and ran up to the tree!
Finally, he was able to take the helm and I was able to start working on the lecture.
Now it represents all sorts of crazy behaviors of procrastinators, such as how I managed to spend two weeks all sorts of actions on writing one sentence in my thesis, and then miraculously, the words come continuously in two days to write 8 pages!.
This whole case with the three characters, this is the system of the masouf.
Not pretty, but in the end, it works.
And this is what I decided to write on the blog two years ago
And when I wrote, I was stunned by the replies,
Thousands of letters I have received, from all kinds of people, from all over the world, doing all kinds of jobs.
Some of them were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and many, many doctoral students,
And they all said they wrote the same thing: "I have the same problem."
What surprised me was the contradiction between the lightness of the words you wrote and the weight of these letters,
These people were writing with great frustration about what procrastination had done to them in their lives, about what this monkey had done to them.
When I thought about it, I thought to myself: If the procrastination system works, what happens?
Why are these people so disappointed?
It turns out that there are two types of procrastination,
Everything I talked about today, all the examples, all have a deadline .
And when there are deadlines, the effect of postponement contains and pressures in the short term to intervene.
But there is another type of postponement, one that occurs in circumstances that do not have a deadline .
For example, if you want to start a freelance business, something in art, or an entrepreneurial business. These works have no deadlines at first, because nothing happened in the first place . Whereas, if you go out and start working hard, you gain some activity to do other work.
There are also a lot of important work outside of your business and do not include deadlines. Such as visiting your family or sports and taking care of your health, working to develop your relationships, or cutting bad relationships.
Now, if the only way to finish these difficult things is by, there is a problem, because in all these important works that do not have deadlines the monster will not appear .
There is no time for him to wake up for. Therefore, the effect of the postponement will not be contained and therefore, these actions will continue and extend forever.
And this is the kind of long-term procrastination that is not seen and doesn't talk much about it like the first type: fun, short-term and deadlines.
And usually people suffer from the second type quietly and privately.
This procrastination can be a major source of long-term sadness and regret.
So I thought, "That's why these people are texting me, and that's why they're in such a bad situation."
Not because they are aiming for a particular project,
It's because of that long-term delay that made them spectators, sometimes, to their lives themselves.
Their frustration does not come from not fulfilling their dreams, but because they could not pursue them in the first place.
As I read the letters, a kind of inspiration came to me: I don't think that there is anyone who does not postpone his work.
That's right, I think you're all screwed,
Of course, you may not be chaotic. Like each other. And some of you may have a good relationship with appointments and sticking to them. But remember: the monkey's secret trick is when there is no deadline.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call this:
Each square represents a week in the life of 90 years,
There doesn't seem to be a lot of them. Especially since we used a lot of them in the past
I think we all need to take a deep look at this table.
And we have to think about what we really postpone, because each of us has something to put off in his life.
We must remain wary of the monkey of instant pleasure,
This is a job for all of us.
And because there aren't so many boxes in the table, this is a job you have to start today.
Hmm, maybe not" today" but...
As you know,
Sometime soon...
Thank you.
We were there, crammed souls and bodies in a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
Stacked in a room like this, but with wooden benches with an annoying creak covered in worn red fabric, with an organ on my left, a choir at the back, and a baptismal tub mounted in the wall behind them.
A room like this, but
With the same strong sense of suspense, the same deep hope for salvation, the same sweat in the palms of the hands and the same people who do not listen in the back.
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I know Him.
That year she reached twelve years of age.
Once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was for Christ to return once I was responsible for everything I had done, I decided it was best for me to solve my own problems very quickly.
That's why I went to church as much as I could.
I listen to stillness with the same eagerness with which someone would listen to the noise, trying to make sure that the Lord did not deceive me and I decided to return early.
In case he did, I had prepared a Plan B, reading the "Left Behind" series, which was the latest fashion of the time.
And I found among its pages that if I didn't get ecstatic at midnight, I had another try.
All I had to do was avoid being branded by the Beast, fighting demons, plagues and the enemy of Christ Himself.
It's going to be tough -- but I know I can do it.
Now the time for planning is over.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We have ten minutes left, and my priest invited us from the benches to the altar because he wanted the prayer to take place when midnight fell.
That's why each faction took its place.
The choir stayed in his podium, the deacons and their wives -- or baptized bourgeoisie as I like to call them -- occupied the first place in front of the altar.
You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
Behind the baptized bourgeoisie were the elderly -- those men and women whose young backs were burned under the scorching suns in the East Texas cotton fields, whose skin looked noble brown by the burn, just like the mud of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams of what life outside East Texas might become even more tilted and shattered than their backs.
Yes, for me these men and women were the stars of the show.
They waited their entire lives for that moment, just as their ancestors from the Middle Ages longed for the end of the world, just as my grandmother waited for Channel Eight's Oprah Winfrey show every day at four o'clock.
Just as she made her way to the altar, I crept right behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother would surely go to heaven.
And I thought that if I held her hand during this prayer, I might go with her in the right direction.
So I held on and closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
The voices of prayers became louder.
The cries of heeding the call to prayer continue to grow louder.
The organ continued to add the funeral carol.
And the heat came to add sweat.
I held my hands firmer, so I wouldn't be the one left in the open.
And I closed my eyes tightly so that I would not see the wheat separating from the fat
Then a voice rang out above us: "Amen."
It's over.
I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked at the older believers whose Savior had not come, who were so proud to show any sign of disappointment, who believed so much and for so long to now begin to doubt.
But I was upset instead of them.
They were deceived, defrauded, misled, and I got along with them all along.
I prayed their prayers, I stayed away from all temptation as much as I could.
I dipped my head not once, but twice in the pool of baptism that prompts contemplation.
I believed.
Now what?
I arrived home just in time to turn on the TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium as it rolled around the world.
It turns out that it would be strange anyway for Christ to return again and again according to different time zones.
And that made me feel ridiculous -- hurt more, really.
That night, I didn't stop believing.
But I believed in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It's possible that the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Now, once upon a time when there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubt running towards its base, a spring promising with rivers.
I can trace all the drama in my life since that night in church when my Savior did not come; when it turned out that the thing I believed in with certainty, if not a lie, is at least not the truth.
Although most of you prepared for the new millennium in a completely different way, I am sure that you are here because part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come.
I stretched out my hand, looking for something I believed in.
When I arrived at Yale at the age of eighteen, I was confident that my journey from Oak Leaf, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the shattered dreams, and the defeated bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself on one of my city's winter holidays lying on the ground face down, my hands tied behind my back and the thief's gun pointed at my head, I understood that even the best education couldn't save me.
I survived when I came as an intern at Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Full of hope -- I even called home to tell my family that we would never be poor again.
But I witnessed the collapse of this temple of money before my eyes, I understood that even the best job could not save me.
I held out when I came to Washington as a young employee, who heard a voice from Illinois calling out, "It's been a long time, but in this election, there will be change in America."
But since Congress had stalled, the state had collapsed, and hope and change seemed like a cruel joke, I understood that even the second political coming couldn't save me.
I have sincerely knelt before the altar of the American dream, praying to the gods of my time for success, money, and power.
But again and again, midnight comes, and I open my eyes to find that all those gods are dead.
From that cemetery, I started searching again, not because I was brave, but because I understood that I either believed or died.
That's why I went on Hajj but somewhere other than Mecca, Harvard Business School, realizing this time that I would not be able to accept the salvation allegedly offered.
No, I knew there would be more work.
It started from a dark spot at a packed party, late in Cambridge's miserable winter when three friends and I asked a question that young people who had been looking for something real for a long time had asked: What if we went on a car trip?
We didn't know where we could go or how to get there, but we knew we had to.
Because, as Jacques Queiroc wrote, all our lives we've longed to "sneak out at night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what people are doing all over the country.
So even though there were other voices who said the risk was too high, and success was uncertain, we went anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 8,000 miles across America, between the cattle pastures of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were starting small businesses where impact is the whole point.
Since we were trained at the Military Academy of Capitalism, we were surprised by this revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, and it turned into a nonprofit organization called MIAS Trans America, and that movement made me stand here on this platform.
It spread because we found a great yearning in our generation to find purpose and meaning.
It spread because we found an endless number of entrepreneurs in the dark corners of America who were creating jobs, changing lives, and needing a little help.
But to be honest, it spread because I fought to spread.
There were no limits where I could stand to preach this gospel, and to make more people believe that we could heal the wounds of a broken state, one social project at a time.
But it is that missionary journey that led me to the very different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
It started almost a year ago at the Natural History Museum in New York, at the Harvard Business School graduation ceremony.
Under a full replica of a whale, I sat with the giants of our time as they celebrated their fellowship and good deeds.
There was a sense of pride where capital and assets under management exceeded half a trillion dollars.
We reviewed everything we did, and it was good.
But two days later, I had to travel north to Harlem, where I found myself sitting on an urban farm that was once empty land, listening to a man named Tony tell me about the children who come there every day.
They all live below the poverty line.
Many carry all their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing it in a homeless shelter.
Some of them came to Tony's program, called Developing Harlem, to get their only meal every day.
Tony told me that he had started "developing Harlem" from his retirement money, after working as a taxi driver for twenty years.
He told me that he does not give himself a salary, because despite the success it has achieved, the program still suffers from a lack of resources.
He told me he might take whatever help he could get.
I have been there as this help.
But once I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of tears falling from my eyes.
I felt so inspired that one night I could sit in one room, with a few hundred people who own half a trillion dollars, and two days later, in another room, 50 blocks north, where a man was not paid to provide a child with her only meal a day.
It wasn't the blatant inequality that made me cry, it wasn't the idea of hunger, homeless children, it wasn't anger toward the one percent or pity toward 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was on dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story represents all those who are expected to solve their own problems even if they have nothing to help them; My organization represents all those structural and systematic aid that has not before reached Harlem, Appalachia, or the Lower Ninth District; My voice represents all those voices that seem illiterate, dirty, and not very equipped.
And the shame of that, that shame overwhelmed me like the shame of sitting in front of the TV, watching Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium again and again and again
I was deceived, deceived and misguided.
But this time, I was the false Savior.
As you can see, I came a long way from that altar the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke vague language and saw suffering as an inevitable divine law and took a text as an inalienable truth.
Yes, I got so much better that I went back to where I started.
Because it's simply not true to say that we live in an age of atheism -- no, we believe today just like ever.
Some of us may have believed in the prophecy of "Briné Brown" or "Tony Robbins"
We may be believers in The New Yorker as a Bible or in Harvard Business Review.
Perhaps we even feel deeper faith when we worship here at TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic, influential leaders that promises to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as the inevitable law of capitalism, that is our God, we accept the text of technological progress as an infallible truth.
We rarely realize the human price we pay when we fail to question a single step, because we fear it will undermine our entire institution.
But if you are confused by the unreasonable things we have to accept, then it should be a time of accountability.
So I don't have the gospel of turmoil, regeneration or TPL.
Today I do not have the gospel of faith to share with you.
In fact, what I have and what I offer is the gospel of doubt.
The Gospel of Doubt does not ask you to stop believing, but asks you to believe in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It's possible that the answers we have are wrong It's possible that the questions themselves are wrong,
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that on this stage, in this room, we are wrong.
Because it raises the question of why?
With all the power at our fingertips, why are humans still suffering so badly?
This skepticism led me to participate, and we put our organization MBAS Transamerica out of business.
We have fired staff, closed our doors and will share our model for free with anyone who thinks they can do this work without waiting for our approval.
This doubt has forced me to abandon the role of Savior entrusted to me by some, because our time is too short and our chances are too far to wait for its second coming, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt feeds me and gives me hope that when we are overwhelmed by our problems, when the paths are revealed to us and seem to lead us to our death, when our healers offer no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith -- it will be our humble doubt that sheds some light on the darkness of our lives and our world and allows us to raise our voice to whisper.
Or to shout or simply say, simply, "There must be another way."
Thank you.
Food crisis.
News appears in the news every day
But what is it?
Lack of food in some parts of the world, or it may be a lot.
In other regions, genetically modified foods save the world.
Could modified foods be the problem?
Frequent dumping of waste into the sea creates bad oceans and toxic oceans, and weakens nutrition.
And it goes on like this forever.
I see the current climate of this debate as horribly unconstructive.
How can we bring this closer to something we can understand?
How is this apple a food crisis?
You must have all eaten an apple last week.
How old do you think this apple is from the moment it is picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- which is the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
I don't expect the average to be very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, put them in cold tanks and then fill the tanks with gas -- there is actually documented evidence of cases where workers tried to enter these environments to retrieve an apple, and died, because of the air inside used to slow the apple process that causes poisoning in humans.
How come none of you knew about this before?
Why didn't I know this before?
Ninety percent of the quality of those apples -- all the antioxidants -- is gone by the time we get them.
It actually becomes just a sugar ball.
How have we become so informative and how can we improve?
I think what we lack is a program
I know programs -- I know computers, they got me online when I was little.
I've done very strange work -- on this program.
But I met people, and I was able to express myself.
How to express yourself in food?
If we had a program, we could feel impulsive to ask: what if?
For me, I asked: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a climate map of the world.
The areas that produce the most in green, and the least productive in red.
They exchange and change, and farmers from California are now Mexican farmers.
China takes Braille land to grow better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
What will this change the way we live?
What will this change the quality of life and food?
The problem of the previous generation was, we need more food and we need it to be cheap.
Welcome to your global farm.
We built a giant model of a farm
All of these ruins -- they are the ruins of cars, airplanes, trains, wheels.
It's a miracle that we feed 7 billion people even though a few of us are involved in food production.
What if..
We built a digital farm?
Global digital farm.
What if you could take this apple, number it somehow, send it through molecules in the air, and reassemble it at the other end?
What if?
I will read some of these sayings. They inspired me to do what I do.
First, "Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, no future," I landed on the day I visited Minamisanerki in southern Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children headed towards Sandai and Tokyo. The land is polluted, they import seventy percent of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Two percent of the American population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from two percent of a country's population?
When we travel around the world, 50 percent of Africa's population is under the age of 18
80 percent don't want to become farmers.
Planting is difficult.
The life of a farmer with small sharesunhappy.
They go to the city.
In India: Farmer families unable to access basic services The number of farmers who committed suicide this year and the previous year is more than the previous 10.
It is inconvenient to talk about this.
Where do they go?
to the city.
No guys, and everyone's headed there.
So how do we build this program that inspires young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my assembly.
In previous years, I went to Bed Bath, Beyond and Home Depot and started hoeing.
And I built trivial things and made the plants dance and connected them to my computer and killed them all -- a lot.
In the end, I made them survive.
And I made one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They say, "Do this, boy!
This is an old unwanted electronic room.
What can you do?"
My team and I built a farm inside the Media Lab, a place that is historically unknown about biology but everything about virtual life.
Within these 60 square feet we produced enough food to feed 300 people once a month -- not a lot of food.
And there's a lot of exciting technology out there.
But the most exciting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors and a monthly harvest.
Is this the new cafeteria?
Is this the new retail experience?
Is this the new grocery store?
I can say one thing for sure: this is the first time someone in the media lab has taken off the roots of anything.
We get power with bags; Nothing is wrong with this.
But what happens when you have an image-based processing expert, a data scientist, they take root and think, "Huh. I know something about -- I can get this done, I want to try."
In this process we will take out the plants and take some of them to the lab, because when you plant and raise them, don't throw them away; It's kind of precious to you.
I have this strange tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anyone eat anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can know the acidity of lettuce up to one-tenth of one.
I say, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat this day."
The lettuce that day was very sweet.
It was so sweet because the plant was exhausted and had created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I won't die!"
And the plant that won't die, tastes sweet to me.
Technology has taken a step back in plant physiology.
We thought that other people needed to try this.
We wanted to see what people could make, so we imagined a lab that we could ship anywhere.
Then we made it.
So in the interface of the medical laboratory comes my laboratory, which has 30 sensor points for each plant.
If you know about genomics or genetics, that's the phenomenon, right?
phenomenon.
When you say "I love strawberries from Mexico," you actually love strawberries from the climate that produced the phrase you love.
So, if you're programming a climate -- so much carbon dioxide and so on oxygen creates a recipe -- you're programming the phrase for this plant, the food for this plant, the size of this plant, its shape, its color, its texture.
We need data. So we put a bunch of sensors there to show us what's going on.
If you think about your plants, and you look at them and you're so miserable because you say, "Why are you dying? You don't want to talk to me?"
Farmers have developed the most beautiful eyes for astrology when they are in their late 60s and 70s.
They can tell you when you see a plant dying from a lack of nitrogen, calcium deficiency or need more moisture.
These beautiful eyes are not passed on by heirs.
These eyes are in the virtual cloud of the farmer.
We extend these data points over time.
We link these data points to individual plants
These are the broccoli in my lab that day, via IP address.
Our broccoli has an IP address.
If that's not strange enough, you can click on one and get a plant profile.
This informs you of the evolution of the downloadable plant, but not as you think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does it arrive at the food I need?
When does it achieve the taste I want?
Does he get too much water?
Does he get a lot of sun?
Warnings.
He can talk to me, he's a speaker, we have a language.
I think this is the first user on Facebook plants, right?
This is the information of this plant and this plant will begin to add friends to God.
And I mean it -- it will add friends from other plants that use less nitrogen or more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn about complexities that we still speculate about now.
And you may not agree to our friendship -- I don't know, and you may agree to our friendship request, and it depends on our actions.
Well, that's my lab.
It's a little better structured and my experience comes from designing data centers in hospitals for everything, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
So -- inside this environment, we test all sorts of things.
This process, hydroponics, was developed from the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water carried into space.
This process works on the basis of giving the plant exactly what it needs: water, minerals and oxygen.
Roots aren't that complicated, so once you give it that, you get that amazing expression.
This is similar to the fact that a plant has two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a whole world.
We've gone too far in the way of technology and the seed of a negative world and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is an integrated world.
Well we've planted all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been produced commercially for 150 years.
Did you know that we have stores of rare and ancient seeds?
Drains or banks for seeds.
It's amazing.
It has living origins and things you have never eaten.
And I am the only castrator in this room who ate this type of tomato.
The problem was that it was in the form of tomato paste that we don't know how to cook, so we ate tomato paste and it wasn't very tasty.
We've done a lot with protein. We've raised all kinds of things.
We were even raised as humans. Well, you might be able to, but we didn't.
But what we made sure of was that, the tool was very large and it was very expensive.
I had started distributing it around the world and it was worth about $100,000.
And to find someone with $100,000 in their back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted another small business.
And this project was actually one of my students -- a mechanical engineer named Camille.
And Camille and I and my team moved around the whole summer how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it so that others can make it.
We then distributed them in schools between seventh and eleventh grades.
And if you really want to humiliate, try teaching a child something.
And so I walked into that school and said, "Organize it at 65 percent humidity."
One seventh-grader said, "What is humidity?"
And I said, "Ha, it's the water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you're stupid.?
I said something like, "Well, don't trust me.
Actually -- you don't trust me, right?
Put it on 100.
So he put it on 100, so what happened?
It started to condense, making a fog and then it started dripping.
And he said, "Oh. Moisture is rain.
Why didn't you simply tell me that?"
We've set up a communication for this that's a lot like the game.
They have a three-dimensional environment, which they can access from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or minicomputers.
They have different parts of the means - natural, sensors.
They choose recipes created by other boys anywhere in the world.
They choose the recipe, run it and plant a seed.
And as they grow, they make changes?
For example, they say, "Why does a plant need carbon dioxide?
Isn't it bad?"
If we increase the gas, the plant will die
If we lower it, the plant grows well.
Harvest the plant, you have created a new digital recipe.
It is an interactive design and development and an exploration process.
And then they can save that, and all the data about the new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what it did -- was it better or worse?
Imagine this as a small hub of operations.
We will learn quite a lot.
And that's one of the food computers, as we call it, in school three weeks later.
This is three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it's the first time this boy thinks about becoming a farmer -- or that he'd want to be a farmer.
That's why we've opened all this to the public.
It's online, go home and try to build your first food computer.
That's going to be tough -- that's what I'm telling you.
We're at the beginning, but it's all there.
It is important to me that entry is easy
And we'll keep trying to make it easier.
These are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, botanists, economists, urban planners.
They work on one basis what they are good at.
But we grew a little bit bigger.
This is my facility that I just started working on.
The warehouse can be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse we will build something like this, for example.
It exists now.
Look at it well.
It really does exist too.
One raises vegetables, another raises a vaccine for Ebola.
It's great that these plants and the winner of the Big Defense Research Agency Award are one of the reasons we've gotten ahead of Ebola.
Plants produce a protein resistant to Ebola.
As well as pharmacists and food specialists, down to lettuce.
But these two things are not similar to each other, and here I show that I am with my field.
Everything is different.
We've reached the strange "everything is good" state and it's like "This is my black box --" and "No, they bought my box."
"No, no, nope -- I have very precious intellectual property rights.
They bought my box, not his."
And the truth is that we're still at the beginning, at a time when society is moving as well.
When we order cheaper food, we don't ask for better eco-friendly food.
And when McDonald announces what's in chicken balls, the strangest food of all time -- and they base their marketing plan on it -- everything changes.
Now let's enter the world.
Private food computers, caterers and food data centers operate on an open phenomenon.
Think of an open genetic map, but we'll put in it small climatic recipes, like Wikipedia, that can be drawn down, occupied, and developed.
What does this look like in the world?
Remember that the world is connected by strings?
We started to find the lighthouses.
We started sending information about food, instead of sending food.
This is not my imagination, this is what we are actually publishing now.
Food computers, food servers, and soon food data centers, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not fighting over what's bad about this.
We know what's bad about this.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and empowering them with a base to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you
There are times when I really feel ashamed to be European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, was pathetic.
There are a lot of contradictions,
They mourned the tragic death of the two-year-old Kurdish boy, and since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, but we have accepted that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe.
We regret that there are human smugglers, but we have made it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of workers, but we have excluded those people to whom our economic and demographic needs meet from coming to Europe.
We profess the liberal values we have in opposition to fanatical Islam, but -- we have repressive policies that hinder child asylum seekers, divide children from their families, and detain refugee property.
What do we do?
How did the situation come to this point, by adopting this inhumane policy to confront this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
But I think it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision of how to embrace an international refugee regime created more than 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, we all need to ask both questions,
The first question, why is the current system not working?
Second, what can we do to reform this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of World War II by these men.
Its primary goal is to ensure that when the state fails, or worse happens, that the regime turns against its own people, people find a place to go, to live in security and dignity so that they can return to their homeland.
It was created specifically for situations like the one we see in Syria today,
Through an international agreement signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the International Commission (UNHCR) has determined that states must reciprocate people on their territory fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
But in practice, our immigration policies are based on blocking the road to safety.
In theory, a refugee has the right to be integrated into society, or to be returned to the country from which he came.
But in reality, their fate remains forgotten indefinitely.
In theory, the refugee issue is a shared global responsibility.
But in practice, geography means that countries close to conflict take up the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
This system is not broken because its rules are wrong.
We have not applied it adequately in this changing world, and that is what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
But not from top to bottom from an institutional perspective, rather than from a refugee perspective.
So imagine a Syrian woman,
And let's call her a princess,
Amira for me represents a lot of people I met in the area.
Amira, who represents about 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and can't go home because she came from this city you see in front of you, Homs, a city that was once beautiful and historic and now under rubble.
And so a princess can't go there.
Nor does it have any hope of being resettled to a third country, as a lottery ticket is only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that a princess can take her family to the camp,
In which it is possible to get help, but there are very few expectations for a princess and her family.
The camps are in gloomy, barren places, often in the desert.
In Jordan's Zaatari camp, you can hear the sound of shells at night across the border in Syria.
There is a restricted economic activity.
,Education is often of poor quality.
Around the world, some 80 percent of refugees living in camps must stay there for at least five years.
It's a miserable life, and perhaps that's why, in fact, only nine percent of Syrians have made this choice.
Alternatively, Amira can go to urban areas to nearby cities, such as Amman or Beirut.
This choice was made by about 75 percent of Syrian refugees.
But there's a lot of difficulty as well.
Refugees in these urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They usually can't access aid,
So when Amira and her family used their basic savings, they were more likely to face urban poverty.
So there is a third alternative for them, and that's why our refugee numbers have increased.
A princess can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a perilous journey to another country, and that's what we're seeing in Europe today.
Around the world, we often face refugees who have no other choice between the three options: camp, poverty in nearby urban areas or a perilous journey.
For refugees, this option is today's global refugee system.
But I think it's the wrong choice.
We could reconsider that choice.
The reason these options are curtailed is because we believe that these are the only options available to refugees, and there are no other options.
Politicians have framed the issue as a zero-sum issue, so that if we take advantage of refugees, we will impose costs on citizens.
We tend to collectively assume that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden on society.
But this is not necessarily and they can contribute to society,
What I would like to put forward is that we can expand those options so that they benefit everyone: host countries and communities, our communities and the refugees themselves.
So I would like to suggest four ways in which we can change the way we think about the refugee issue.
All four of these methods have a common denominator: they are the same ways that bring us to globalization, mobility and markets, and to modernize the way we think about refugees.
The first way I would like to think is the idea of enabling environments, which starts with a fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, I embarked on a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is representative of all host countries.
Not like this. It's because it's exceptional.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunities.
It gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences for both refugees and host communities are extraordinary.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21 per cent of refugees own businesses that employ other people, and 40 per cent of those employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens in the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional examples of thriving and vibrant entrepreneurial companies,
For example, in a settlement called Nakival, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
We found Rwandans who runs the available business that allows young people to play computer games from TVs and recycled games,
Unlike the restrictions imposed on them elsewhere, refugees innovate, and the man you see in front of you is a Congolese named Demo-Kai.
Demo-Kai arrived in this settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a way out.
He started with a local radio station, with a group of friends and colleagues, hired a video camera, and is now a filmmaker,
He made two documentaries with our team and succeeded in setting up a very little business.
It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities that seek human prospery.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter and food are all important in an emergency, but we also have to look further.
We need access to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the ways we take to access the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have practiced the same methods as ours.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still alternative realistic options we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, accompanied by development economist Paul Collier, and we came up with an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to provide jobs for Syrians by supporting Jordan's National Development Strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into work alongside employing Jordanian host nationals.
Just 15 minutes from Zaatari camp, there is home to 83,000 refugees, the current economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone.
The government has spent more than a hundred million dollars to connect it to the electricity grid and roads, but it lacks two things: access to work and inward investment.
What if refugees were able to work there – instead of being stuck in camps, they would be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We realize that Jordan can benefit from this, whose development strategy requires a qualitative leap from a middle-income country to an industrialized country.
It can benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to the reconstruction of post-conflict Syria by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the ultimate best source for rebuilding Syria.
We published the idea in the Journal of Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah picked up this idea,
It was announced in London at the Syria conference two weeks ago and will begin to be implemented next summer.
The third idea that I want to put in your hands is the homogeneous preference between countries and refugees to reach happy results like the one you see here in portraits of Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
What we've rarely done is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but what I'm interested in saying is that we can do that and make everyone better.
The economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of homogeneous markets, in such ways that the order of preference of the parties constituted final homogeneity.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tittelbauim have devised ways to apply this idea to refugees by asking refugees what their preferred places are, but it also allows countries to categorize the types of refugees they want to host based on skill or language criteria and allow them to engage.
Now, of course, you need to build quotas like diversity and vulnerability, but it's the way to increase the possibility of inclusion.
The idea of integration has been successfully used, for example, the involvement of students in universities, the involvement of kidney donors in patients, and lies behind the algorithms on dating sites.
So why not apply the idea of giving refugees greater options?
It can also be used at the national level,. Whereas, one of the big challenges we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees,
Currently, in my country, for example, we often send engineers for rural areas and farmers to cities, and that makes no sense at all.
Homogeneity of markets provides a potential means of bringing those preferences together and listening to the needs and demands of the host populations and refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put in your hands is humanitarian visas.
So much of the tragedies and chaos we saw in Europe could have been completely avoided,
It proceeds from the fundamental contradiction in asylum policy in Europe, which is the following: in order to obtain asylum in Europe, you have to spontaneously come through these perilous journeys that I have described.
But why should such dangerous flights be necessary when we are in the age of low-cost airlines and the capabilities of modern embassies?
It's completely unnecessary journeys and, last year, led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people at Europe's borders and within European territory.
If refugees are simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we will avoid this, and there is a way to do this through something called a humanitarian visa, which allows people to get a visa at the embassy or consulate of a neighboring country where they simply pay for their journey by ship or fly to Europe.
About 1,000 euros is the cost of smuggling a refugee from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It costs €200 to travel by economy from Bodrum City to Frankfurt.
If we allow refugees to do this, it will have great positives.
It will save lives and we will completely cut off the smuggling market and remove the chaos we see in Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands.
It's a policy that prevents us from doing this rather than a rational solution,
And this idea has been applied,
Brazil has adopted a pioneering method: more than 2,000 Syrians have been able to obtain humanitarian visas, and when they enter Brazil they receive refugee status.
Every Syrian with this project has refugee status and has been recognized as a genuine refugee.
And there is another historical precedent as well,
Between 1922 and 1942, these passports were used as travel documents to allow the transfer of 45,000 Armenians, Chechens, and Turks to travel through Europe and obtain refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The International Office for Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this workable strategy.
So all four ideas that I have given you are a path through which we can expand the range of princess options,
These are ways in which we can have great refugee choices away from the three impossible basic options I have explained to you so that you leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, one that expands refugees' options but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yes, it is a humanitarian issue and responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents and ambitions, and they have the ability to contribute... If we allow them to do so.
In the New World, migration is not on the demise.
What we have seen in Europe will be present with us for many years.
People are going to keep traveling, they're going to continue to be displaced from their homelands, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this... It is not based on the old logic of humanitarian assistance, nor on the logic of philanthropy, but on building the opportunities offered by mobility and globalized markets,
I assure you that we must wake up from our inattention and urge politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Oh thank you.
When I was a little kid, I always dreamed about the ocean.
This wild place, full of color and life, was home to these imaginary alien beings.
I photographed the big sharks dominating the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing around the reef.
As a marine biologist and photographer, I have spent most of my career looking for magical places like the ones I dreamed of when I was young.
As you can see, I started discovering sea bodies at a relatively young age.
But the first time I dived deep into the water, I was ten years old.
I still remember very well when I swam fiercely to reach that old cannon clad in shallow corals.
When I finally got to it, I looked up, I was surrounded by fish from everywhere in all the colors of the rainbow.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peshak, a forty-year-old conservation photographer on the planet, had the opportunity to discover some of the stunning seascapes of National Geographic Magazine and Protect Our Seas.
I've photographed everything from huge sharks to small ones that fit into my palms.
"I inhaled the fishy smell of humpback whales feeding a foot away from me in the cold seas of Canada in the Great Bear rainforest."
I was familiar with the mating rituals of sea green turtles in the Mozambique Strait.
Every person on this planet is affected by and influenced by the ocean.
The ancient and clean seas I dreamed of as a child have become very difficult to find.
The seas are under greater pressure and more threatened.
As humans, we continue to maintain our role as predators on Earth, and many of these direct effects have been seen and photographed.
For a long time, I thought about shocking my audience with their indifference with some disturbing images.
Although this approach has advantages, I went back to the beginning.
I believe that the best way to change is to sell love.
I think I'm kind of playing the "suitor" and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to detect the entire animals and ecosystems that lie beneath the ocean's surface.
You can't fall in love with something and become its hero if you don't know it exists.
By revealing this -- this is the power of photography to conservate.
I have visited hundreds of marine sites, but only a few seascapes have caught my attention and had a profound impact.
The first time I experienced that altitude was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged and wild coastline.
In June and July, huge swarms of sardines travel north in a mass migration of what we call the "Sardines Escape".
And those fish have a good reason to escape.
Where they are hunted by predators and agile.
Dolphins hunt in a common way and can disperse a flock of sardines to create small and tempting groups of fish.
You lure the fish to the surface of the ocean and then they rush to dinner to celebrate.
It is believed that sharks are behind it.
Now, most people think that both sharks and dolphins are deadly enemies, but during the "sardines escape," they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks feed effectively.
Without the help of dolphins, food balls are more prevalent and sharks often end up eating so-called sardines, or with a mouth full of water.
Now, having had exciting moments with sharks during "Sardines Escape" I knew they didn't see me as prey.
However, I am slapped like any other guest during this very noisy feast.
From the shores of Africa let's travel to the east, where the vast Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of atolls.
During the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays travel across the archipelago to a small spot in Baa Atoll called Habiru.
Large populations of crustaceans, most of which do not exceed the size of the pupils, are the staple food of manta rays.
When the amount of moss plants becomes small, manta rays feed on their own and somersault many times around themselves, like a small puppy chasing its tail.
Whereas, when the amount of moss plants rises, the manta rays line up behind each other to form a long food chain, and if the first fish cannot eat the food, of course the next fish will take possession of it.
The lower the amount of algae in the bay, the closer the manta rays get to each other – a unique behavior called hurricane-shaped feeding.
Since they hover in a narrow form, this group of manta fish creates a kind of cyclone, absorbing algae and offering them to their mouths.
The experience of diving among hundreds of manta rays is truly a unique and unforgettable experience.
When Hannefaru was first photographed, this area was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with NGOs such as the Manta Trust, Suri inevitably helped Hannevaru become a protectorate.
Currently, fishermen from neighboring islands have once caught manta rays to make traditional drums out of the skin of these fish.
Today, they are some of the most ardent conservatives and the Maldivian economy earns more than $8 million each year because of manta rays.
I've always wanted to go back in time in an era when maps were mostly empty or read, "There's a dragon."
Today, the closest I visited is the remote islands in the western Indian Ocean.
Away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is an emotional reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Few people have heard of Bassas da India, a small spot of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
They are coral reefs that act as a protective external barrier and the inner lagoon is the nursery place for Galapagos sharks.
Those sharks were shy even during the day.
I had the feeling that they would be bolders and their number would rise at night.
I have never encountered so many sharks on coral outcrops.
Photographing moments like this and sharing them with everyone -- reminds me of why I chose this path.
Sometime this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic magazine in Baja California.
About halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a breeding ground for gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast has seen a massacre, with more than 20,000 gray whales killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today the descendants of these same whales push their young children to the surface to play and even interact with us.
These species have really seen a remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pelmo, a quiet fishing island.
Decades of indiscriminate fishing caused the collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the authorities to declare its waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing less than a miracle.
In 2005, after just one decade of protection, scientists measured the extent to which fish were recovered.
But don't hear a word from me -- come with me.
With just one breath, dive with me into the depths, one of the biggest fish places I've ever encountered.
We all have the potential to create some kind of hope.
Through my photography, I want to spread a message: It's never too late to protect our oceans.
And I want to focus in particular on, the resilience and ease of adaptation of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will look more and more to do pictures like this, to create images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
I hope it will become a daily event for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be hopeless optimist.
And always work on the premise that the wonderful image that will make a change is only very close, behind the next coral, inside the next lake or maybe in the next lake.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was the basis of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government was resurrected after a long war for independence and immediately announced a socialist program: both health care and primary education services were essentially free.
Rural health centres have been deployed and nearly 80% of the population can access these services in less than two hours on foot, a huge achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, about 25% of children in Zimbabwe were vaccinated.
By 1990, just a decade later, that figure had reached 80%.
I felt very proud to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
That sense of excitement and friendship was evident.
Working alongside the intelligent citizens of Zimbabwe -- scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt that I belonged not only to the African independence movement, but also to the public health movement in progress.
But there were enormous challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year it was submitted.
I took care of a number of people with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what was in the Africa store.
The infection rate increased by about 2% during the first days I was there.
This could rise for one in four adults 17 years after the time she left Harare.
By mid-1990, I learned about hundreds of people in a very young year who had been infected with HIV.
I saw many colleagues and friends die, my students and hospital patients die.
In response to these cases, my colleagues and I set up a hospital.
We have done several interventions to explain condom use.
We conducted interventions in the workplace.
We did research. We gave guidance to the partners of the injured men on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard and at the time I thought I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, just like it was.
But I wasn't talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke of his personal failures that led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations Peacekeeping Department.
On the 10-year anniversary of the genocide, he stated: "I thought I was doing my best, but after the genocide I realized that there were a lot of things I could or should have done to sound the alarm and join forces to provide support."
The AIDS epidemic has ravaged the health of a society that was not prepared, and today the World Health Organization has estimated that nearly 39 million people have died from this disease, and I am not the only one who is overwhelmed with regret and regret that I did not do more things earlier.
But while I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't see myself as an advocate or a politician.
I was there to improve my technical skills, my skills related to my epidemiological research.
In mind, my job was to care for patients and do research to better understand patterns of transmission in the population, and I hoped to slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially marginalized strata of the population were most at risk of contracting AIDS and dying.
For sugar cane farms, which are more like a feudal-based system than any modern enterprise, 60% of pregnant women have been reported to be HIV-positive.
I have made it clear that the injury is not about moral decay but about a culture of male superiority, forced immigrant labour and colonialism.
As health professionals, our tools were very limited: we advocated for people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms and limit the number of partners.
Infection rates soared, and when treatment became available in the West, the treatment that is still our most powerful weapon against this virus, treatment was not available to the public sector in Africa.
I did not mention the inequality in access to these life-saving drugs or the implicit economic and political systems that were the cause of infection rates among many people.
I justified my silence by reminding myself that I am only a guest in this country. Sounding the alarm can get me fired, preventing me from doing good work, caring for my patients, and doing the research I desperately need.
So I didn't talk about the government's early position on AIDS.
I didn't express my concerns loudly enough.
Some doctors and health professionals will think that I did not do anything wrong.
Our agreement with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its derivatives, revolves around the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.
I have done everything I can for each of my patients.
But I knew that epidemics emerge over the fissures that exist in our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization and exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, social class and others.
This is true for AIDS.
This was recently true in the case of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who did his studies on AIDS in Haiti, call this violence structural: structural because abuses are inherent in economic and political regulation in our social world, often in ways invisible to those with privilege and power, and since violence is a reflection -- premature death, suffering, illness -- is a kind of violence.
We do little for our patients in case we fail to regulate these instances of social inequality.
Sounding the alarm is the first stage to disseminate the right to public health, and it is the way to come together to support to get out of this situation and achieve some kind of change together.
So these days, I won't stay calm anymore.
I will talk about many things, even if the listeners are not comfortable, even if I am not comfortable either.
And a lot of my talk will be about racial and racial differences in institutions, things that should never exist in this country, certainly not in the field of medical practice or public health.
But they exist, and we pay them to end our lives prematurely.
That's why we should ring the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States of America, the ongoing violence between individuals and within institutions and black people, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow laws and 60 years of troubled equality.
In New York City, premature death -- meaning death before age 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black people than for white people.
A black woman in 2012 faced a 10 times higher risk of dying at birth than a white woman.
Although we have made tremendous strides in reducing infant mortality, black infants face almost three times the risk of dying in their first year compared to white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics correspond to other statistics across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis found that 1.5 million black people are missing.
They noted that more than one in six black men who are supposed to be between the ages of 25 and 45 have gone missing and disappeared from daily life, have gone to jail or died prematurely.
This is a huge kind of inequality in the daily and inappropriate violence faced by young black people, and the recent protests have centered around the slogan of #حياة_ذوي_البشرة_السوداء_مهمة.
But we must remember that the permanent, uneven proportions and consequences of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS -- are diseases that can lead to death slowly and quietly and may take many black lives prematurely.
As the #حياة_ذوي_البشرة_السوداء_مهمة movement spread, I was frustrated and outraged that the medical community had opposed the use of the word "racism" in our research and studies.
You probably felt something whenever I uttered this word.
Our medical students protested the Day-ins method in their white blouses, but the medical community supported this negatively since discrimination continues to affect the level of disease for people and deaths.
I am concerned about the trend around precision and personalized medicine, in search of biological or genetic targets to develop better treatments, which may inadvertently cause us to deviate from the overall picture of the subject, which is the everyday context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves and most importantly, determines the health of the population and, for many of us, "poor health."
As health professionals, in our daily work, whether in the hospital or when doing research, we witness a state of great inequality: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has other priorities, transgender youth who are contemplating suicide because our society is so cruel, a single mother who should feel responsible for her son's poor health.
Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients, but to ring the alarm bell and advocate for change.
Whether it is credible or not, our community website gives our voices great credibility, and this should not be compromised.
I lament not speaking in Zimbabwe, and I vowed that as Commissioner of Health in New York City, I would use every opportunity I could to ring the alarm bell and join forces to support health equity.
I will speak out against racism and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you talk about sexism or any other form of equality.
It is time for us to rise up and speak out loud about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, and the health of all of us, depends on that.
Well, by a show of hands, how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something annoying about politics or religion, child protection or food?
And how many of you try to ignore at least one person because you simply don't want to talk to them?
You know, we just had to follow Henry Higgins' advice in Mayfair Lady: stick to talking about weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and the fight against vaccines, those subjects -- aren't safe either.
So this world we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to turn into argument, where politicians can't talk to each other and where even the most trivial issues find someone to fight for or against emotionally, it's not normal.
Pew Research conducted a study of 10,000 American adults and found that at the moment, we are more polarized, more divided, than at any time in history.
We are unlikely to reach a compromise, meaning we don't listen to each other,
We make decisions about where we live, who to marry, and even who will be our friends, depending on what we believe in beforehand.
Again, that means we don't listen to each other.
Conversation requires alternating between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way, this conversation loses that balance.
Now, part of that comes down to technology.
Smartphones that are either in your hands or close enough so that they can be reached quickly
According to Pew Research, about one-third of Americans send more than 100 messages a day.
Many, almost most, are more likely to exchange messages with their friends than to watch them face-to-face.
There is an excellent article in the Atlantic magazine.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his children a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular topic without using notes.
"I realized... "
I realized that being able to speak is probably one of the skills we've failed to teach.
Children spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely have the opportunity to hone interpersonal communication skills.
This question may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any skill in the 21st century more important than being able to maintain a coherent and confident conversation? "
Now, I speak directly to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, and plumbers.
I talk to people I love. I talk to people I don't like,
I talk to some people with whom I disagree deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I would like to use the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like looking into someone's eyes while speaking, thinking in advance about interesting topics to discuss, looking and moving your head and smile to show that you are a source of speech, repeating what you just heard or summarizing it.
I want you to forget all that.
Because that's crap!
There's no reason you should learn how to show attention if you're really attentive.
Now, I actually use the same skills in professional interviews that I do in normal life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to meet people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to become a better communicator.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time and without getting bored, for God's sake, without offending anyone.
We've all had important previous conversations.
We've done it before,we know what it looks like.
The type of conversation you have fun with and feel inspired, or with which you feel that you have communicated deeply or that you have been excellently understood.
There's no reason why most of your relationships aren't like the previous ones.
So I have 10 basic rules that I'm going to explain to you, but honestly, if you just pick one and apply it, you'll have a great conversation.
Number one: Do not multitask.
And I don't mean to leave your mobile phone, tablet, car keys or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean, be mindful.
Live the moment.
Don't think about the argument you had with your boss.
And don't think about what you're going to eat for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, exit the conversation, but don't be half inside the conversation and half outside it!
Tanya: Don't stick to your opinion.
If you want to express your opinion without giving any opportunity to respond or discuss, or increase and develop your idea, write a blog.
Now, there's a really good reason why I shouldn't let critics be on my show: because they're really boring.
If they were conservative, you would find them hating Obama, food stamps and abortion.
If they were liberals, they would hate big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
We can predict this perfectly.
And you don't want to be.
You need to enter every conversation assuming you have something you want to learn.
As the famous therapist Scott Beck said, proper listening requires putting oneself aside.
This sometimes means canceling your personal opinion.
If we feel this acceptance, the speaker will become less likely and more likely to open what he has and what is inside his mind to the listener.
Again, let's say you want to learn something.
As Bill Nye said, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't."
And I put it this way: everyone is an expert on something.
Third, use open-ended questions.
In this case, the reference is journalists.
Start your questions with what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complex question, you will get an easy answer.
If I asked you, "Were you terrified?"
You'll respond to the strongest word in the sentence, "Terrified," and the answer will be "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let them describe it, they are the ones who know.
Try asking them questions like "how was that"?
"How did that feel?"
Because then they may have to stand for a moment and think about it, and so you'll get more enjoyable answers.
Fourth: Walk with the current.
This means that thoughts will come to your mind and what you need is to make those thoughts come out of your brain.
I have often heard interviews where guests speak for several minutes and then the host comes back and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere or has been answered beforehand,
This meant that the host stopped listening for two minutes because he thought about this ingenious question, and was determined to say it.
We do the same way.
We're sitting with someone we're talking to, and suddenly we remember that day when we met Hugh Jackman at the café.
And we stop listening.
Stories and ideas that will come to your mind,
And you need to let these ideas go and come.
Fifth: If you don't know, say you don't.
People on radio, especially on stations like NPR, are much more aware that they're recording, and so you find them more cautious about the things they claim to be experts at and the things they claim to be confident about.
Do this with caution.
Hadith should not be cheap.
Sixth: Do not compare your experience with theirs.
If they're talking about the loss of a family member, don't talk about the time you lost a family member.
If they're talking about some of the problems they face at work, don't talk to them about how much you hate your job.
The subject is not the same, and it will not be.
Each experience can be taken separately.
And most importantly, it's not about you.
You don't need to talk and try to show how amazing you are or how much you've suffered in the past.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking about his IQ, and he said, "I have no idea. Because people who brag about their IQ are losers."
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Seventh: Do not try to repeat yourself.
Because in it a kind of self-underestimation and boredom, and we do it a lot.
Especially in business conversations or in conversations with our children, we want to come to a certain meaning, so we just paraphrase words over and over again.
Don't do that.
Eighth: Stay away from weeds.
And what I mean frankly, is that people don't care about the years and the names, the dates, and all these details that struggle to remember.
They don't care about that and what they care about is you.
They care about what you love, and what you have in common.
So, forget these details and leave them.
Ninth: This is not the last point, but the most important point.
Listen.
I may not be able to tell you how many people have told you that listening can be the most important skill they can develop.
Buddha said, "And here I am formulating his words for you, if your mouth is open, you will not learn."
Calvin Coolidge said, "No one has lost their job because of excessive listening."
So why don't we hear each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am under control.
And I don't need to hear anything I'm not interested in.
And so I'm the center of attention.
I can strengthen my identity.
But there's another reason: our attention is distracted.
An average person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can hear 500 words per minute.
So our minds are busy and filled with 275 words like that.
I also know that it takes energy and effort to pay attention to someone, and if you can't do that, you're not actually talking.
But you are two people screaming and saying barely a few sentences in the same place.
So we have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it beautifully.
"Most of us don't listen with the intention of understanding," he said.
But he listens with the intention of replying only."
Another rule, which is the tenth rule, is to shorten the speech.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt. It's short enough to draw eyesight, long enough to cover the 'awrah --My sister] All of this boils down to the same basic concept: Be interested in others.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there were certain rituals in my house.
People would come and talk to my grandparents, and after they went, my mother would come to us and say, "Do you know who that was? "
She was the bridesmaid of Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer Prize. He is a famous Russian ballet dancer."
So I grew up on this assumption that everyone has something special hidden from them.
And honestly, I think that's what made me the best hostess.
And it is that I try as much as possible to keep my mouth shut, my mind open, and I'm always ready to be amazing, and I've never been disappointed.
And you have to do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams. I am a hero.
I won medals in three different sports and at the National Games in Canada, I played internationally in basketball and I am proud to have represented Canada globally.
I train five days a week in basketball and speed skating, working with top-level coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best in my sport.
By the way, all during the Special Olympics.
Does this change your perception of me and my achievements?
The world like me is not considered heroes.
Not long ago, people like me were outcasts and hiding out of sight.
There have been a lot of changes since the Special Olympics began in 1968, but in many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to others everywhere.
People use insulting words in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
The word "late" or "late" is used in a derogatory way.
They don't care how painful I am and that of my friends.
I don't want you to think that I'm here because I'm a humanitarian cause.
And I'm here because there's still a big problem with the way people with intellectual disabilities are treated, or, more often than not, how they don't pay attention to them at all.
Did you know that the World Games took place this year?
I was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in Los Angeles.
There were more than 62,000 spectators who watched the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSN and ESPN.
Do you know what happened?
What comes to your mind when you see someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to look at us in an equal way.
The Special Olympics are changing the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of followers.
For those who are not aware of it, the Special Olympics are for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympics and the Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality sports mobile programs for people with intellectual disabilities that can make changes to their lives and thoughts.
This activity changed my life and the lives of many.
It changed the way the world views those with intellectual disabilities.
She was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
As I grew older, I played hockey until the age of 12.
The older you get, the harder you feel it is to communicate with everyone, and the angry and frustrated you are.
I didn't play any sports for a while, I didn't have many friends and I felt like I was abandoned and sad.
There was a period when people with intellectual disabilities were hiding out of the sight of society.
It never occurred to them that they could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the physical fitness of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion that the lack of opportunity to participate caused physical fitness suffering.
Many have questioned the extent to which people with intellectual disabilities benefit from fitness programs and opportunities behind sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founders of the Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics players proved them right more than four and a half million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous, because I was young, shy, unsure and I didn't have many friends.
When you got there, everyone was cheering, supporting you and leaving room for you to be yourself without prejudice.
I am now a basketball player and skater who competed regionally and nationally, and this year he made it to the World Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first Canadian to join the basketball team and compete at the World Games.
I am one of more than four million five hundred athletes from all over the world, and I have heard many similar stories.
Being athletes at the Special Olympics allowed us to regain our pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics address critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than normal men, and that women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than those without a disability.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by being energetic and participating in sports.
The trainers taught us nutritional and health rules.
The Special Olympics also provide free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with a direct doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, I played with members of my Canadian team against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian basketball team underwent a World Games athlete's health check, with 7 out of 10 players receiving free headphones and being able to hear clearly for the first time.
The change was astounding.
They were more excited, happier and confident, because their coach was able to communicate with them with words.
And they got emotional because they could hear the sound of basketball, the whistle, the fans in the stands -- this seemed like a given.
The Special Olympics don't make a change for athletes only.
You also change their lives off the field.
This year, research has shown that nearly half of U.S. adults don't know even someone with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with people with intellectual disabilities are less accepting and positive.
Then there are those hurtful and insulting words that prove that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to many people.
People use it as if it were just passing words or a way to insult.
I was mentioned in tweets more than nine million times last year, it was very painful for me and for the four million five hundred athletes around the world.
Many don't consider it an insult, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global envoy John Franklin Stevens wrote in an open letter to political critics who used it as an insult, "Join us one day at the Special Olympics.
Let's see if you leave and nothing has changed inside you."
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people stood in a long line for hours to attend the weightlifting finals.
Everyone only stood up when my colleague Jackie Barrett, the huge Newfoundland, lifted 655 pounds, and lifted 611 pounds in a squatting position. This sets a new record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among all athletes in Newfoundland – not just in Special Olympics, but in weightlifting as a whole.
Jackie was a shining star in Los Angeles, and she was impressed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few thought people with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Amphitheater to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and cheer on athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Apart from being hiding out of sight, we were getting encouragement and being celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes confidence and self-pride.
The Special Olympics taught the world that people with disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
I now have my dreams and ambitions associated with this sport, good coaches, respect and dignity, good health, and a career as a personal trainer.
I'm no longer one of those who hide and get bullied, and here I am presenting a TED conversation.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you can see their abilities.
The next time someone next to you uses those vile words, please tell them the pain you're leaving behind.
Please consider participating in the Special Olympics.
I would like to continue my talk with one last thought.
As Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the potential to make a difference in the world."
Special Olympics is changing the world by making changes in four million five hundred athletes and allowing us to be confident, to meet friends, not to prejudge, to feel that feeling and to be champions.
Thank you very much.
You may not have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Uroa, Nigeria.
But I know that they are the most unusual place on Earth.
In the hospitals there, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists quietly fighting one of humanity's deadliest dangers for years: the Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
A severe fever can occur and is often fatal .
But these people, they put their lives on the risk every day to protect the people in their communities, and in doing so, they protect us all.
But one of the most unusual things I learned about them on one of my first visits there in many years was that every morning -- these challenges, extraordinary days in the front rows -- they start singing.
They come together, show their joy.
They show their souls.
And through the years, year after year when I visit them and they visit me, I gather with them and sing and write and love this, because it reminds us that we are not only here to pursue science together, we are connected together by our common humanity.
And that's certainly, as you can imagine, has become very important, even essential, as something to start change.
That changed a big deal in March 2014, when an Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This is the first epidemic in West Africa, along with the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
This was scary, scary for all of us.
We were actually suspects for some time Lhasa and Ebola were spreading more than expected, and we said it was possible that one day he would come to Kenema.
So some members immediately walked out of my team and joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team there, and we prepared a diagnosis to be able to get partial sensitivity tests to catch Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We were already preparing these tests for the Lassa virus, we knew how to do this, the team was fantastic.
We just had to give them the tools and the place to reconnaissance for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of the hospital, and the team performed these important molecular tests and identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an extraordinary act that was done.
They were able to diagnose the condition immediately, treat the patient safely and initiate a tracing call to find out what was happening.
I stopped something.
But by that day the epidemic had broken out for months?
In hundreds of cases, it has already overshadowed all previous epidemics.
He came to Sierra Leone not as an individual case, but as a big wave.
We had to work with the global community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema. Let's start with those cases, where the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that can cope with this.
And we've been working around the clock, trying to do the best we can, trying to help these people, trying to get attention, but we've also done something simple.
From that sample that we took from the patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can get it out, clearly.
The other thing we can do, actually, is stop it chemically, put it in a box and then send it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent him to Boston, where my team works.
We worked around the clock, dividing the work into shifts, day after day, and quickly produced 99 Ebola genomes.
This is the blueprint -- the viral genome is the blueprint.
We all have one.
He says everything inside us, and he says so much information.
The result from such work is simple and powerful .
We can actually take these 99 different viruses, watch them and compare them, and we can see, in fact, a comparison of three genes and this has happened before and spread from Guinea, we can show the beginning of the eruption in rich months ago, once for humans, and then transmitted from human to human.
Now, that's very important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is to track.
We can also see that the virus, during its transmission between humans, mutates.
And each of this is very important, because of the diagnostics, the vaccinations, the treatments that we use, all based on this genetic sequence, basically -- that's what drives it.
And so the global health experts have to respond, they have to evolve, to examine everything they've been doing.
But the way science works, and where I was at that moment was, that I had the information, I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzing the information carefully, slowly submitting the paper for publication, going through several attempts back and forth, and finally when the paper is published, we can disclose the information.
This is how the situation currently works.
Well, that wouldn't have worked at this point, would it?
We had friends on the front lines and for us it was clear that what we needed was help, a lot of help.
And so the first thing we did was, as soon as the sequence came out of the machines, we posted it online.
We spread it to the whole world and said, "Help us."
Help came.
Before we knew it, we were contacted from all over the world, they were impressed to see the information abroad there and his publication.
Some of the world's greatest virus followers are suddenly becoming part of our society.
We've been working together in this virtual way, sharing, making regular calls, communicating trying to track the virus minute by minute, to find ways to stop it.
And there are a lot of ways we can be communities like this.
Everyone, especially when the pandemic started to spread globally, would come abroad to learn, to participate, to coalesce.
Everyone wants to play a role.
The amount of human capacity out there has been fantastic, and the Internet has brought us all together.
And you can imagine this instead of being afraid of each other, that's all we said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together, and let's make this happen."
But the problem was that the information we all use, searching the internet, is very limited to do what we need to do.
Many opportunities were lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the epidemic in Kenema, we had recorded 106 cases of patients, and again we did this openly and publicly available to the world.
In our labs, we were able to show that you can take the 106 records, we can train computers to predict and predict Ebola patients with almost 100 percent accuracy.
And we made an app that could deploy this, to make this available to healthcare workers in the field.
But 106 is not enough to make that strong, to be proven.
So we are waiting for more information to release it.
That information is yet to come.
We are still waiting, manoeuvring away, in silos instead of working together.
And only -- we can't accept this.
Correct? You, all of you, cannot accept this.
It's our life on the line.
In fact, we have lost a lot of lives from many health care workers, including my dear colleagues, five colleagues Mbalu Foni, Alex Moj Boi, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Kofama and Muhammad Fula.
These are just five of the many health care workers in and around Kenema who died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and alone.
So, Ebola, like all dangers to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight between us, the virus thrives.
But not like other dangers to humanity, Ebola is the only one where we are all the same.
We're all in that war together.
Ebola on someone's doorstep could soon be on our doorstep .
So in this place with the same weaknesses, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope we can work together with joy.
My graduate student was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I discovered the word "Kenema," the hospital where we work and the city we work in Sierra Leone, named from the word mindy meaning "pure as a river, transparent and open to the public eye."
This was very deep for us, because without knowing this, we always felt that in honor of the people in Kenema where we were working, we had to work openly, we had to get involved and work together.
We should have done this.
We all have to demand this for ourselves and for others -- to be open to each other when another pandemic happens, to fight this war together.
Because this isn't the first Ebola epidemic and it won't be the last, and there are a lot of other microbes out there waiting, like Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a millionaire city, it could start there.
It can be something that travels through the air.
It can even be deliberately deployed.
And I know that's scary, I understand this, but I also know, and this experiment will show us, that we have the technology and we have the ability to succeed on this thing, to succeed on this and be the ones with the upper hand over viruses.
But we can only if we do it together and if we do it cheerfully .
And that is for Dr. Khan and for all those who sacrificed their lives in the front lines of this war with us always, to be with them in the war always,
And let's not make the world known for the devastation wrought by a single virus, but lit by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
