Well, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It&#39;s a story about this woman, Natalia Rybczynski.
She is a paleontologist, which means she specializes in digging up very old dead creatures.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, someone calls me “Doctor of the Dead.”
Latif Nasser: I think it&#39;s particularly interesting because of the drilling places to look for these things, way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at a dig site called the Camel Rest, which lies less than 10 degrees of latitude away from the attractive North Pole.
Natalia: Really, it wouldn&#39;t seem very exciting, because you spend the whole day walking with your backpack and GPS and notebook and picking up anything that might look like a fossil.
Latif Nasser: At a certain location, I noticed something.
Natalia: Something rusty, sort of rust-coloured, about the size of the palm of my hand.
She was lying on the roof.
Latif Nasser: At first she thought it was just a splinter of wood, because such things had been found in that place before - parts of prehistoric plants.
But that night, on the way back to camp...
Natalia: ...I took out the hand lens, looked at it carefully, and realized that it did not bear traces of tree rings.
Maybe something that has been carefully preserved, but really looks like...
Bones.
Latif Nasser: Over the next four years, I went to the site again and again, and eventually collected 30 fragments of the same bones, most of them really small.
Natalia: Not a big group. It fits in a small ziplock bag.
Nasser Latif: And I tried to put it together like a jigsaw puzzle.
But it was a challenge.
Natalia: It was broken into several small pieces. I tried using sand and putty, but it didn&#39;t look good.
Ultimately, we used a 3D scanner.
Latif Nasser: Oh! Natalia: Right?
Latif Nasser: It turns out that doing this virtually is the easiest way.
Natalia: It&#39;s kind of magical when it fits together.
Latif: How confident were you that you were doing it properly, that you had collected it correctly?
Is there a possibility to put them together in another way and get a parakeet, for example?
Natalia: No. No, we got this.
Latif Nasser: What I got, I discovered, was the tibia, the shin bone, specifically, belonging to the hoofed mammal family, something resembling a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn&#39;t be one of them.
It was very big.
Natalia: The size of this thing was enormous, it was a large animal.
Latif Nasser: What animal could it be?
She presented one of the fragments to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea for it.
Natalia: We took a hacksaw, cut a hole in it, and an interesting smell came out of it.
Latif Nasser: It smelled like burnt meat.
It was a smell Natalia knew from cutting skulls in the anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.
Usually, after many years, it collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic was like a natural refrigerator and saved him.
But a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol and met a colleague of hers called Mike Buckley who was demonstrating a new process he called “collagen fingerprinting.”
It turns out that different taxa have slightly different collagen structures. If you get a collagen composition from unknown bones, you can compare it with known taxa, and who knows, you might get a match.
So she sent one of them to him, FedEx.
Natalia: Yes, you want to track that. It&#39;s kind of important.
. Latif Nasser: He processed it and compared it with 37 species of mammals known today.
And he got a match.
The 3.5 million-year-old bone found by Natalia from the High Arctic was found to...
camel.
Natalia: And it occurred to me, what? This is amazing--if true.
Latif Nasser: They examined all the fragments, and got the same result.
However, based on the size of the bones that were discovered, this means that these camels are 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.
This camel will be about 9 feet long, and weigh almost half a ton.
Yes,
Natalia found a giant camel from the Arctic.
Now, when you hear the word “camel,” what might come to mind is one of these, the two-humped camel from the Middle East and Central Asia.
But chances are the picture in your mind is one of these, the one-humped camel, the quintessential desert creature -- expanding in hot, sandy places like the Middle East and the Sahara, on its back an old, oversized hump to store water for long desert treks, and has big, broad feet to help it along. On climbing the sand dunes.
So how did one of them end up here in the High Arctic?
Well, scientists have known for a long time, as it turns out, even before Natalia&#39;s discovery, that the beauty actually has American ancestry.
They first appeared here.
For approximately 40 of the 45 million years camels have been around, they can be found in North America alone, approximately 20 different species, and perhaps more.
Natalia: If you put it in a group, would it look different?
Latif Nasser: Yes, you will have different sizes.
Some will have very long necks, so much so that they actually look like a giraffe.
Latif Nasser: Some of them have a nose, like crocodiles.
Natalia: The primitive ones were really small, almost like rabbits.
Latif Nasser: What? A rabbit-sized beauty?
Natalia: The old ones.
So you probably won&#39;t be able to recognize it.
Latif Nasser: Oh my God, I want a pet camel-rabbit.
Natalia: I know, wouldn&#39;t that be great?
Latif Nasser: About three or seven million years ago, a group of camels headed toward South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another group crossed the Beringia land bridge toward Asia and Africa.
Then, before the end of the last ice age, camels became extinct in North America.
Scientists knew all that already, but it&#39;s still difficult to explain how Natalia found one so far north.
Low temperature, polar opposite of desert.
Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, warmer than it is now.
They would have been boreal forests, more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, like, the winter is going to be six months long with the ponds freezing over.
Snow storms may hit.
The night lasts for 24 consecutive hours.
Like, how so... how?
How did one of the desert stars manage to survive and live in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues thought they had the answer.
Which is kinda cool.
Whether the features we imagine make the camel adapt in places like the desert actually evolved to help it cope with winter?
What if his wide feet were supposed to tread not on sand, but on snow, like ski boots?
What if that hump -- and this was a surprise to me, it doesn&#39;t contain water, it contains fat -- was there to help the camel survive the six months of winter. When food is scarce?
And then, later, long after crossing the bridge, did she modify her winter features to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, hump can be good for beauty in hot climates because all the fat is in one place, like a backpack of fat, which means you don&#39;t need all that insulation throughout the rest of your body.
So it helps dissipate heat easier.
This is a crazy idea. It seems like evidence that the idyllic desert landscape could be evidence of the ancient Arctic.
I&#39;m not the right person to tell you this story.
Others have said it&#39;s a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or a future clue to climate change.
But I like it for completely different reasons.
For me, this story is about us, about how we see the world and about how that has changed.
I was trained as a historian.
And I knew that, in fact, a lot of scholars are historians too.
They made sense of the past.
They tell us the history of the universe and the planet we live on.
As a historian, you start with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
Natalia: We make up stories and stick to them, like a camel in the desert, right?
This is a great story! Perfectly adapted to it.
Apparently she lived there forever.
Nasser: But at any moment, some evidence could be discovered.
Learning a few little things can force you to reframe everything you thought you knew.
Like, in this case, a scientist found a single piece of what she thought was wood, and because of that, science has a completely new and completely contradictory theory of why this creature looks the way it does.
And for me, that completely upended the way I thought about sentences.
He went from being a silly creature only suited to one specific environment, to being a traveler in a world that happened to be located in a desert, he could end up almost anywhere.
I present to you &quot;Azure&quot;.
Azuri, hello, how are you?
Well, here, I got one of these for you.
Azzurri enjoys a break from his normal grind at Radio City Music Hall.
It&#39;s not just a joke.
Anyway--but, Azuri is among us as a living reminder that the story of our world is vivid.
It requires a willingness to control, and a habit of imagination.
Isn&#39;t it, Azzurri?
And that we are only a small piece away from seeing the world in a new way.
Thank you very much.
Today&#39;s computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how bad they are.
Today I&#39;d like to talk to you about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
I would first like to take you back to a cold night in my neighborhood in 2011 that had a profound effect on me.
I was sitting at a local bar outside Columbia University. Where I studied computer science and neuroscience, I was with a fellow student in the midst of an interesting conversation about the potential of holograms to replace computers one day.
And just as we were getting to the most interesting part of the conversation, of course his mouth lit up.
He pulled it towards him, looked at it, and started typing.
Then he began to force his eyes to look at me and said, “I give you my full attention.”
But of course his eyes were glued to the phone, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar I noticed another student holding his phone. This time it was with a group.
He was scrolling through pictures on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically.
And this duality between my miserable feeling and their happy feeling about the same technology. It got me thinking.
The more I looked into the matter, the more I realized that the negative factor in the equation was not the digital information, but rather simply the location of the screen that separated me from my friend and brought these children together.
You see, they were gathered around something, just like our ancestors who developed social cognition and told stories around a campfire.
And that&#39;s exactly the role of tools, I think.
Its role lies in extending the capabilities of our bodies.
I think computers today do the opposite.
Whether you&#39;re emailing your spouse, composing a piece of music, or comforting a friend, you do it all in much the same way.
You bend over those rectangles, pressing buttons and menus and more rectangles.
It occurred to me that this is the wrong way. I think we could use a machine that is closer to nature.
We have to use machines that bring our work back to reality.
We should use machines that use neuroscientific principles to expand our sensory perceptions rather than reduce them.
Circumstances were such that I should have such a machine with me.
It&#39;s called Meta 2.
Let&#39;s try it.
I see the audience directly in front of me, and I see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we will see a spectral image, a very realistic spectral image appearing in front of me, in front of these glasses that I am wearing now.
This could be anything we are shopping for or learning about, and I can use my hands and move them with ease.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We&#39;ll come back to this in a moment.
Now, if you&#39;re like me, your mind is reeling at the possibilities of what this technology will allow us to do. Let&#39;s look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, so naturally, the first thing I imagined was to extend a building in three-dimensional space instead of using these two-dimensional plans.
She is touching the drawings at this moment and choosing an interior decor.
All of this was filmed on a GoPro camera through our own glasses.
This second use is special to me. It is a project by Professor Glass Brain Representation, thanks to the University of California, San Francisco.
As a student of neuroscience, I always dream of being able to learn and memorize all these complex brain structures with a real machine that enables me to touch and manipulate various brain structures.
What you&#39;re seeing is called augmented reality, but to me it&#39;s related to a more complex story -- the story of how we can extend the capabilities of our bodies with digital devices instead of doing the opposite.
now...
I think that in the next few years, humanity will go through something of a transformation.
We&#39;ll start by putting a whole layer of digital information on the ground.
Imagine for a moment what this might mean for novelists, painters, brain surgeons, interior designers and perhaps everyone present today.
And what I think we need to do as a society. It is trying and making an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of making our reality a game or cluttering it with digital information.
And this is my passion.
I want to share a little secret with you.
After five years -- this is not the smallest of devices -- after about five years, they&#39;ll all look like glass bands on our eyes showing spectral images.
Just as we don&#39;t care what hardware we buy -- we buy it because of the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I&#39;ve always dreamed of making a brain operating system.
And it&#39;s important to do it the right way, because we&#39;ve probably lived inside these things at least our entire lives with the Windows graphical interface.
And I don&#39;t know about you, but living under Windows terrifies me
To isolate the most famous interface from infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design principles rather than leaving a group of designers fighting over it in the boardroom.
The principle we all aspire to is called the &quot;neural path of least resistance.&quot;
At every turn, we connect the mental operating system with our mind for the first time to the peculiarities of our brains.
Meaning we are trying to make a computer that is easy to use.
We&#39;re building a system you&#39;ve always known how to use.
These are the first three design principles we are employing in this new user experience.
The first and most important principle is that you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract. It requires more effort from your brain to decode it.
It works against the neural path of least resistance.
Whereas in augmented reality, of course, you can put the spectrogram of the TED stage here, and the spectrogram of your email on this side of the desk, and your spatial memory has evolved to find them.
You can put in whatever Tesla you want to buy -- or whatever my legal team asked me to put in before the show.
Great, your brain knows exactly how to retrieve it.
The second principle we call “touch to see.”
What do children do when they see something that catches their attention?
They try to reach out and touch him.
This is exactly how a natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system gets a key boost from a sense we call proprioception -- the sense of internal organs.
So by touching our work directly, we will not only be able to control it better, but we will also understand it more deeply.
From him came the idea of “touch to see”.
But it&#39;s not enough to try things for ourselves.
We are social primates.
Which brings me to the third principle, the anthropomorphic campfire from our first story.
Our mirror neurons indicate that we could communicate better with each other and our work if we could see each other&#39;s faces and hands in 3D.
If you look at the video behind me, you see the two Meta users playing with the same spectrogram, making eye contact, and connected around this thing, rather than being distracted by external devices.
Let&#39;s try this again, taking neuroscience into account.
So, our preferred operating system, the mental operating system.
Now I&#39;m going to go one step further and take these glasses and leave them here next to the desk.
I am present with you in this moment, we are in touch.
My spatial memory activates and I can take it and bring it towards me, reminding me that I am the operating system.
And my proprioception is working, and I can blow these glasses into a million pieces and touch the sensor that&#39;s now scanning my handprint.
But seeing things alone is not enough, after a second my partner will make a 3D call --?
How are things?
I can see it in front of me in 3D.
And it is very realistic.
Thank you all.
This will replace antennas by mirror neurons in the not too distant future.
How are things?
: Great we are live.
:, give the audience the gift of the spectral brain that we saw in the video above.
This will change not only phones, but also the way we collaborate.
Thank you very much.
Thank you .
: You&#39;re welcome.
: This is the message that was discovered in that bar in 2011. The future of computers is not on one of these screens.
It is here, within all of us.
If there&#39;s one idea I want to put forward to you, it&#39;s that the natural machine is not a fantasy from the future, it is here in 2016.
That&#39;s why all 100 people at Meta, including the management team, CEOs, designers and engineers - and before TED2017, we&#39;ll be throwing away our computer screens and replacing them with a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Thank you all.
: Tell me one thing. Because I&#39;ve done a few AR demos over the past year or so.
There is debate among technological experts. Its topic: Do we actually see something real on the screen?
There is an issue related to field of view, in a way technology shows us a wider view than what you can see through glasses.
Was what we saw real?
: certainly.
Not only that, but we took extra precautions to photograph him through the lenses of a GoPro camera in the various shots we watched.
We want to simulate the real experience we see through the glasses, without any tricks.
: Thank you for showing us that. : I appreciate that, thank you very much
I&#39;m from the most liberal, tolerant, progressive place in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, my father was a university professor. I am truly grateful to them for raising me, because I have always felt completely comfortable planning my life exactly the way that suits me.
In fact, I took a different path than the one my parents had planned.
When I turned 19, I left college -- dropped out, got kicked out, say what you will.
Then I took a path as a professional French horn player, which was my life&#39;s dream.
She performed stage music all over America and Europe, and toured for a few years with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd.
At the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a great life.
And you know, my parents never complained.
Rather, they supported me along my path.
It wasn&#39;t their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, &quot;Our son, he&#39;s on a break for a decade.&quot;
And--and yet there was a difficult conversation about my lifestyle that I would like to share with you.
I was 27, and I was coming home from Barcelona, and I had visited my father for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
She was quiet, very quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said: “Mom, what’s on your mind?”
She replied: “Your father and I are really worried about you.”
So I said, &quot;What?&quot; I mean, what is it, now?
She replied: I want you to be completely honest with me: Were you voting Republican?
Well, the truth is, I wasn&#39;t a politician, I was just a French horn player.
But I was fond of discoveries, and they had uncovered that, and that caused some confusion.
You see, I was passionate about capitalism, and I want to tell you why.
That seems to be my constant interest, believe it or not, in poverty.
You see, when I was young, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower-middle-class family, but of course that was not real poverty.
This is never close.
The first time I saw poverty, and the face of poverty, was when I was six or seven years old, in the early 1970s.
It was, like many of you, an irregular, trite example.
It was a picture in National Geographic of a kid who was my age in East Africa, and he had flies on his face and a swollen belly.
He would not have escaped his inevitable fate. I was aware of that, but I could do nothing.
Some of you remember that photo, not exactly that photo, but any photo like it.
It introduced the West to the severe poverty found around the world.
Well, that vision followed me until I grew up and went to school, graduated, went back to school and started having my family.
I wondered, what happened to that child?
Or for people like him around the world?
And I started studying, even though I wasn&#39;t in school, I was looking for the answer: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Has their condition become worse? are you okay? Or what?
I found the answer, it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
You see--most Americans believe that poverty has become worse than it has been since we were children, since they have seen that vision.
If you ask Americans, &quot;Is poverty around the world getting worse or better?&quot; 70% of people will answer that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
But this is the truth.
This is the discovery that changed my thinking.
From 1970 to the present, the percentage of the world&#39;s population living under levels of hunger, living on a dollar or less a day, of course with the necessary adjustment for inflation, has decreased by 80 percent.
There has been an 80% reduction in the world&#39;s worst poverty since I was a child.
I didn&#39;t even know about that.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
This is something we should celebrate.
It is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in the history of humanity, and it happened in our lifetime.
When I found out, I wondered what enabled us to do this? How did it become possible?
If you don&#39;t know why? You won&#39;t be able to do it again.
If you want to do it again and lift two billion people out of poverty, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been talking about since I was a kid, at least two billion of those people, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want another two billion so I wanted to know why.
I started searching for the answer.
It was not a political answer, because I did not care.
You know, I still don&#39;t care.
I wanted the best answer from economists left, right and center.
And here we are.
These are the reasons.
These are 5 reasons to lift 2 billion of our brothers and sisters out of poverty since I was a kid.
First: globalization.
Second: Free trade.
Third: Property rights.
Fourth: The rule of law.
Fifth: Creating projects.
This was due to the free economic system that spread around the world after 1970.
Now, I&#39;m not naive.
I know that free institutions are not perfect, I know that free institutions are not all we need to build a better world.
But that&#39;s cool.
And beyond politics.
This is what I learned. This is what I discovered.
Capitalism is not only accumulation.
Because at its best, it&#39;s ambition, which is what a lot of people talk about on this platform, the ambition that comes from dreams and is an integral part of the free economic system.
We have to share it with more people.
Now, I want to share with you a second discovery, which is related to the first one, and which I believe will contribute to development not only around the world, but here at home.
The best quote I&#39;ve ever heard that summarizes the ideas I just told you about lifting people out of poverty is this: “Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
&quot;It has lifted billions of people out of poverty.&quot;
Who said this?
He looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
its wrong.
President Barack Obama is the one who said that.
Why do I know that by heart?
Because he told me so.
Madness.
And I said, &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;
But more than that, I said, &quot;What an opportunity.&quot;
Do you know what I was thinking?
It was during an event we were doing on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought, this is the solution to the big problem that America faces today. What?
It is centered around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help the people who need us most.
Right now, I won&#39;t have to tell anyone in this room that we are in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world, related to political polarization.
It has risen to critical crisis levels.
This is unpleasant and not true.
There was an article last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious journals published in the West.
An article was published in 2014 about the asymmetry of political action.
What is this? This is what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your belief is based on love but that your opponent&#39;s belief is based on hatred.
This is common in global conflict.
It is expected to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
What the authors of this article found was that in America today, most Republicans and Democrats suffer from a lack of consistency in political action.
The majority of people today who are politically active in our country believe that they are motivated by love, while the other side&#39;s motive is hatred.
Think about this. Think about this.
Most people say, &quot;You know, my faith is compassion. I want to help people, but other people are evil and they&#39;re looking out for me.&quot;
You cannot develop as a society when you suffer from this kind of asymmetry.
This is impossible.
How do we find a solution to this?
Well, first, let&#39;s be honest: there are differences.
Let&#39;s not underestimate the differences. That would be kind of naive.
There is a lot of good research on this.
One of my old TED lecturers is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a doctor of psychology at New York University.
Conducts studies on the beliefs, values, and morals of several people to discover how they differ.
It has been demonstrated, for example, that conservatives and liberals have different interests in what they believe is important.
For example: John Haidt proved that liberals care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic freedom.
Conservatives care about economic freedom 28 percent more than they care about poverty.
Paradoxical differences, isn&#39;t it?
We will never agree. mistake.
This is the diversity in which our strength lies.
You remember what brought the poor out of their poverty?
It was this obsession with poverty, linked to the way economic freedom spread around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and lift another two billion people out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Hmmmm.
How will we do this?
It&#39;s a confusing thing, isn&#39;t it?
We need creative thinking.
Lots of it on this platform.
Creating social projects, yes. naturally. Outstanding.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, ethical and responsible way. Yes Yes.
But do you know what we really need?
We need a new day with a flexible ideology.
We should be less predictable.
is not it?
Do you feel that your belief is starting to become predictable?
A bit traditional?
Do you feel like you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why would this be dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, conservatives, you always talk about taxes and laws and big government.
On the left, liberals, you talk about economics, it&#39;s always about income inequality.
correct? These things are important now, very important to me. Very important to you.
But when it comes to saving starving people who need us, this will be a distraction.
We need to come together and agree on the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best tools at our disposal. This can be achieved when conservatives acknowledge their need for liberals and their obsession with poverty, and the liberals’ need for conservatives and their obsession with free trade.
It is in this diversity that the future strength of this country lies, if we choose it.
So how are we going to do this, how are we going to do this together?
I&#39;ve got some business rules, not just for you, but for me as well.
Firstly. Rule number one: Remember, it is not good enough to tolerate those who disagree with you.
This is not good enough.
We must remember that we need people who are different from us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these means.
Now, what are you going to do? How will you express that?
Where does this start? It starts from here.
You know, all of us in this room right now are blessed.
We are blessed to have people who hear us.
We are blessed with luxury. We are blessed with leadership.
When others hear us, with this kind of unexpected ideology, people can listen.
Perhaps progress can be made towards that point.
This is number one. Number two.
Number two: I ask you and myself to be that person who transcends barriers, the mysterious person, who is difficult to classify.
If you are a conservative person, be that conservative person who always strives around poverty and the moral duty to be a poverty fighter.
And if you are a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets in solving our problems when used responsibly.
If we do that, we&#39;ll have two things.
First: We should start working on the next two billion and be the solution that we have seen so much of in the past and need to see more of in the future. This is what it will be like.
Secondly, we may be able to change the terrible ideological holy war that we are suffering from in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, maybe, just maybe, we&#39;ll realize that our biggest differences aren&#39;t really that different.
Thank you all.
When I was in university, my major was in government work, which meant that I had to write a lot of papers.
Now when any normal student writes a paper, his work schedule looks roughly like this.
As you can see, the work is slow at first, but you accomplish enough during the first week that you will see the heavy days ahead look productive and nice.
And I wish I could do the same,
This will be the plan.
I will start writing the schedule to start working, then the time comes to write... and I end up like this!
This happens in every paper I write.
Until he asked me to write a 90-page graduation thesis, a paper that we were supposed to work on throughout the year!
And for a paper like this, my regular work schedule wasn&#39;t an option.
Because the project was very huge
I started planning the project, and decided that the schedule should look something like this..
This is how the year will go.
I will start with easy and light work, then I will increase the effort a little in the middle of the year, and at the end of the year I will work as hard as I can.. It will be very easy, like climbing the ladder, rung by rung.
How difficult can it be to climb stairs?
No big deal, right?
But the funniest thing happened to me...
In the first months,
It came and went quickly, and I couldn&#39;t do anything.
So I decided to change my plan a little..
Then...but in fact, the middle of the year passed quickly, and I did not write a single word. Now you are here!
The two months were reduced to one month...then to two weeks...
One day I woke up, and there were only three days left until the delivery!! I had not written a single word yet, so I did the only thing I could do. I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, and went for two full days without sleep. Humans should not stay up for two days without sleep. I ran to the university, and in slow motion I delivered the paper on time. Exactly specified!
I thought I had accomplished everything.
A week later, I received a call. It was a call from the university.
They asked, &quot;Are you Tim Urban?&quot;
She replied: “Yes.”
They said: “We should discuss your thesis with you.”
“Okay,” I said.
They said: “It is the best thesis we have ever seen in our lives!”
This did not actually happen,
It was a very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought: “This guy is amazing!”
No, no, it was very bad
Anyway, today I am a writer and blogger on the Internet..
I write a blog called “Wait, but why?”
Two years ago I decided to blog about procrastination and postponement
My behavior always confused the non-procrastinators around me and why I postponed my work, so I wanted to explain to them and to the world, what goes on in the heads of those who procrastinate and postpone their work, and why we are like this.
I had a theory that procrastinators&#39; minds were actually different from other people&#39;s
To test this, I found a laboratory that allowed me to use an MRI machine to scan my brain and the brain of another man who does not procrastinate so I could compare them.
I brought the pictures with me so you can see them for yourself today.
Now I want you to take a closer look to see if there is a difference.
I know not all of you are experts, and it&#39;s not obvious but just look, okay?
So here is a picture of the brain of the one who does not postpone,
And now..
Here is a picture of my brain.
There is a difference .
Both minds contain, but the procrastinator&#39;s mind also contains
Now, what does this mean for a procrastinator?
It means everything is fine until this happens.
Man: “This is the perfect time to get work done.” Monkey: “No!” Then he will do something useful and productive. But the monkey does not like the plan, so the monkey takes the wheel and says: Why don&#39;t we read the entire Wikipedia page about the Nancy and Tonya scandal, because I just remembered that this happened!
Then...then we will go to the refrigerator to see if anything has changed in the past 10 minutes...
After that, we will enter the YouTube spiral that begins with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends after a very long time with watching interviews with Justin Bieber’s mother..
Monkey: “All of this will take time, and there is no space to do anything today.
&quot;Sorry!&quot;
Now, what&#39;s going on here!
This monkey doesn&#39;t look like someone you&#39;d want at the helm.
He lives entirely in the present moment,
He has no memory of the past and no knowledge of the future. He only cares about two things: “easy and fun.”
In the animal world, this works perfectly.
If you are a dog, and you do nothing but easy and fun, then you are successful by all standards!
And for apes, humans are just another kind of animal.
They eat, sleep and reproduce...which would be normal in primitive times.
But, if you haven&#39;t noticed, we are not in those times
We are in a developed and civilized time, and the monkey does not know the meaning of that.
And that&#39;s why it exists in our head, which gives us abilities that no other animal can do,
We can imagine the future,
We can see the full picture
We can make long-term plans.
The decision maker takes all of this into account.
He wants us to do only what seems right and logical to do now.
Sometimes doing something seems logical and enjoyable at the same time, such as having dinner or going to bed, or enjoying free time.
Therefore, there is an overlap between the logical and the enjoyable.
Sometimes they agree,
Other times, it makes more sense to work at something difficult and unenjoyable for the greater good.
And here the contradiction occurs.
For the procrastinator, this conflict always ends in the same way, causing him to spend most of his time in the orange zone, a fun and easy zone that is completely separate from the circle of logic.
I call it.
Now, a place that all you procrastinators know well.
A place where leisure activities occur in time that is not actual leisure time.
The fun you are having is not real fun, because it is completely undeserved and the atmosphere around you is filled with guilt, unhappiness, anxiety and self-loathing - all the beautiful feelings of procrastinators.
The question when the monkey is behind the wheel is: How does the procrastinator move himself to the Blue Zone, an area where things happen that are less fun and easy but are much more important?
Well, it turns out that the one who postpones his work has a guardian angel, someone who is always watching him and looking at him in his darkest and darkest moments.. a person called
Now he sleeps most of the time...but he wakes up suddenly, when any deadline is very close or there is a risk of embarrassment in front of people or losing the job, or any other frightening consequence..
The most important thing is that it is the only thing that scares the monkey.
Now, this monster has become connected to my life recently, because the TED conference leaders contacted me six months ago and invited me to speak at it.
Of course I said: Yes, it was always my dream to
I&#39;ve spoken at a TED conference in the past
In the midst of all this excitement, the decision maker was thinking about something else.
He was saying, &quot;Are we clear about what we just agreed to?&quot;
Do we know what will happen one day in the future?
&quot;We need to sit down and prepare the speech right now.&quot;
The monkey said: I completely agree with you, but how about we open Google Maps, zoom in on the bottom of India, and explore it for two and a half hours until we reach the top of India, in order to educate ourselves about this country?
This is what we did that day.
6 months turned into 4, then into 2, then into one month.. The TED conference decided to announce the conference speakers,
When I opened the website, I found a picture of my face staring at me.
And guess who woke up?
He began to lose his mind...and in a few seconds, order turned into chaos.
And the monkey got up - remember, the monkey is afraid of the terror monster - and ran up the tree!
Finally, he was able to take the helm and I was able to start working on the lecture
Now it represents all kinds of crazy behaviors of procrastinators, like how I was able to spend two weeks all kinds of behaviors to write one sentence in my thesis, and then miraculously, the words come continuously in two days to write 8 pages!
This whole situation with the three personalities, this is the procrastinator&#39;s system.
It&#39;s not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write on the blog two years ago
And when I wrote, I was amazed by the responses,
I received thousands of messages, from all kinds of people, from all over the world, doing all kinds of jobs.
They included nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and many, many doctoral students.
And they all wrote and said the same thing: “I have the same problem.”
What surprised me was the contrast between the lightness of the words I wrote and the weight of these letters.
These people were writing in great frustration about what procrastination had done to them in their lives, about what this monkey had done to them.
When I thought about it, I said to myself: If the procrastination system worked, what would happen?
Why are these people so frustrated?
It turns out that there are two types of procrastination:
Everything I talked about today, all the examples, all have a deadline.
When there are deadlines, the effect of postponement is contained and the short-term pressure to intervene.
But there is another type of postponement, one that occurs in circumstances that do not have a deadline.
For example, if you want to start a freelance business, something in the arts, or an entrepreneurial business... these businesses have no deadlines in the beginning, because nothing happened in the first place. Whereas if you go out and start the difficult work to gain some energy to do other work.
There is also a lot of important work outside the scope of your work that does not include deadlines, such as visiting your family, exercising, taking care of your health, working to develop your relationships, or breaking up bad relationships.
Now, if the procrastinator&#39;s only way to finish these difficult things is by getting things done, there&#39;s a problem, because in all this important work that doesn&#39;t have deadlines the monster won&#39;t appear.
He doesn&#39;t have a time to wake up to. So, the effect of postponement will not be contained and therefore, these actions will continue and extend forever..
This is the type of long-term procrastination that is not seen or talked about as much as the first type: fun, short-term and containing deadlines.
Usually, people with the second type suffer quietly and privately.
This procrastination can be a great source of long-term sadness and regret.
So I thought: That&#39;s why these people are writing to me, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re in such a bad state.
Not because they aim for a specific project,
Rather, because of that long-term postponement that made them like spectators, sometimes, to their lives themselves..
Their frustration does not come from not achieving their dreams, but rather because they were not able to pursue them in the first place.
While I was reading the letters, a kind of inspiration came to me: I do not think there is anyone who does not postpone his work.
That&#39;s right, I think you&#39;re all procrastinators,
Of course, you may not be anarchists like some of us. Some of you may have a good relationship with appointments and adherence to them. But remember: The monkey&#39;s secret trick is when there is no deadline.
Now, I want to show you one last thing..
I call this:
Each square represents a week in the life of a 90 year old,
There doesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of them...especially since we used a lot of them in the past
I think we all need to take a deep look at this table.
We must really think about what we are putting off, because each of us has something we are putting off in our life
We must remain wary of the instant pleasure monkey,
This is a job for all of us.
Because there are not that many boxes in the table, this is a job that you must start today.
Hmmm, maybe not “today” but..
as you know ,
Sometime soon...
Thanks .
There we were, souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
Crowded into a room like this, but with creaky wooden benches covered in worn-out red cloth, with an organ to my left, a choir behind me, and a baptismal basin set into the wall behind them.
A room like this, however
With the same intense sense of suspense, the same deep hope of salvation, the same sweat on the palms of hands and the same people in the back not listening.
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it.
That year I turned twelve and reached the age of accountability.
Once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Christ would come back once I was accountable for everything I had done, I decided I had better solve my own problems as quickly as possible.
That&#39;s why I went to church as much as I could.
I listened to the silence with the same eagerness a person might listen to the noise, trying to make sure that the Lord was not deceiving me, so I decided to return early.
In case he did, I had prepared an alternative plan, by reading the “Left Behind” series, which was the latest fashion at the time.
And I found among its pages that if I did not have an orgasm at midnight, I would have another try.
All I had to do was avoid being branded by the beast, fighting demons, plagues and the enemy of Christ himself.
It&#39;s going to be hard--but I know I can do it
Now the time for planning is over.
It was 11:50 pm.
We have ten minutes left, and my priest called us from the pews to the altar because he wanted the prayer to be held when midnight arrived.
That&#39;s why each faction of the sects took its place.
The choir remained in its lectern, and the deacons and their wives--or baptized bourgeois, as I like to call them--occupied the first place before the altar.
You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And just behind the baptized bourgeoisie were the old men--those men and women whose youthful backs had been seared under the hot suns of the East Texas cotton fields, and whose skin had been burnt burnished a noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams had been twisted and broken for what might become. It has life outside of East Texas even more than their backs.
Yes, for me these men and women were the stars of the show.
They had waited their entire lives for that moment, just as their medieval ancestors longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey show on Channel 8 every day at four o&#39;clock.
And just as she made her way to the altar, I snuck up right behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother would definitely go to heaven.
I thought that if I held her hand during this prayer, I might go with her in the right direction
So I held on and closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
The prayers became louder.
The cries in response to the call to prayer continue to grow louder.
The organ continued to add the funeral hymn.
The heat came to add sweat.
I held my hand tighter, so that I wouldn&#39;t be the one left out in the open.
I closed my eyes tightly so that I would not see the dung separated from the fat
Then a voice rang out above us: “Amen.”
It&#39;s over.
I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked at the older believers whose Savior had not come, who were too proud to show any sign of disappointment, who had believed so strongly and for so long that they were now beginning to doubt.
But I was upset instead of them.
They&#39;ve been tricked, defrauded, misled, and I&#39;ve played along with them all along.
I prayed their prayers, I turned away from every temptation as much as I could.
I dipped my head not once, but twice, in the baptismal pool that prompts blowing my nose.
I believed.
and now what?
I arrived home in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the start of the new millennium as it rolled around the world.
It seemed to me that it would be strange anyway for Christ to return again and again in different time zones.
And that made me feel silly--more hurt, really.
That night, I didn&#39;t stop believing.
But I believed something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It&#39;s possible that the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
And now, once upon a time where there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubt running toward its base, a spring of rivers of promise.
I can trace all the drama in my life back to that night in church when my Savior didn&#39;t come; When the thing I believed with certainty turned out to be, if not a lie, then at least not the truth.
Although most of you prepared for the new millennium in a completely different way, I am confident that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come.
I spread my hands out, looking for something to believe in.
When I arrived at Yale at the age of eighteen, I remained confident that my journey from Oak Leaf, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams, and the defeated bodies I had seen.
But when, on one of the winter holidays in my city, I found myself lying face down on the ground, with my hands tied behind my back and a robber&#39;s gun pointed at my head, I understood that even the best education could not save me.
I survived when I came as an intern at Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Full of hope--I even called home to tell my family that we would never be poor again.
But as I witnessed this temple of money collapse before my eyes, I understood that even the best job couldn&#39;t save me.
I endured when I came to Washington as a young clerk, hearing a voice from Illinois calling, saying, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time coming, but in this election, there&#39;s going to be a change in America.&quot;
But as Congress had stalled and the country had collapsed and hope and change seemed like a cruel joke, I understood that not even a political second coming could save me.
I knelt faithfully at the altar of the American dream, praying to the gods of my time for success, money, and power.
But again and again, midnight comes, and I open my eyes to find that all those gods are dead.
From that cemetery, I started searching again, not because I was brave, but because I understood that I either believed or died.
So I went on Hajj but to a place other than Mecca, Harvard Business School, knowing that this time I would not be able to accept the salvation he was allegedly offering.
No, I knew there would be more work.
It began in the dark of a crowded party, one late night in a miserable early Cambridge winter when three friends and I asked a question that young people searching for something real have asked for a long time: What if we went for a drive?
We didn&#39;t know where we could go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because, as Jack Kerouac wrote, all our lives we&#39;ve longed to &quot;sneak out into the night and hide somewhere,&quot; going to find out what people around the country are doing.
So, despite other voices saying that the risk was too great, and success too uncertain, we went anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 8,000 miles across America, between the cow pastures of Montana, the wastes of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses where impact was the bottom line.
Since we are trained in the military academy of capitalism, we were surprised by this revolutionary idea.
And that idea spread, and it turned into a non-profit organization called MIAS Across America, and that movement brought me here on this platform.
It has spread because we have found a great yearning in our generation to find purpose and meaning.
It caught on because we found an endless supply of entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and just needed a little help.
But to be honest, it spread because I fought to spread.
There were no limits to which I could preach this gospel, and make more people believe that we could heal the wounds of a broken nation, one social project at a time.
But it was that missionary journey that led me to the very different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
It started one night about a year ago at the Natural History Museum in New York, at a Harvard Business School alumni party.
Under a perfect replica of a whale, I sat with the giants of our time as they celebrated their fellowship and good deeds.
There was a sense of pride with capital and assets under management exceeding half a trillion dollars.
We went over everything we did, and it was good.
But then, two days later, I had to travel north to Harlem, where I found myself sitting on an urban farm that had once been an empty lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me about the kids who came there every day.
They all live below the poverty line.
Many of them carry all their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them at the homeless shelter.
Some of them came to Tony&#39;s program, called Growing Harlem, for their only daily meal.
Tony told me that he started Growing Harlem with his retirement money, after working as a taxi driver for twenty years.
He told me that he doesn&#39;t give himself a salary because, despite the success he has had, the program is still under-resourced.
He told me he would take any help he could get.
And I was there as this assistant.
But as soon as I let go of Tony, I felt the burn and salt of tears falling from my eyes.
I felt a surge of inspiration that one night I could be sitting in one room, with a few hundred people who have half a trillion dollars, and then two days later, in another room, 50 blocks north, where an unpaid man was providing a child with her only meal of the day.
It wasn&#39;t blatant inequality that made me cry, it wasn&#39;t the idea of hunger, of homeless children, it wasn&#39;t anger towards the one percent or pity for the 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story stands for all those who are expected to solve their problems on their own even if they have nothing to help them do so; My organization represents all that structural and systemic aid that has never before reached Harlem, Appalachia, or the Lower Ninth Ward; My voice stands for all those voices that sound illiterate, dirty, and very ill-equipped.
And the shame of that, that shame, overwhelmed me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the start of the new millennium again and again and again.
I was deceived, deceived and misled.
But this time, I was the false savior.
You see, I&#39;ve come a long way from that altar the night I thought the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke in vague language and saw suffering as inevitable divine law and took scripture as infallible truth.
Yes, I&#39;ve improved a lot and I&#39;m back to where I started.
Because it is simply not true to say that we live in an age of atheism--no, we believe today just as much as ever.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We may be believers in the New Yorker as a Bible or the Harvard Business Review.
We may even feel a deeper faith when we worship here at TED Church, but so badly we want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of attractive, influential leaders that promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as an inevitable law of capitalism. That is our God. We accept the text of technological progress as an infallible truth.
We rarely realize the human price we pay when we fail to question a single step, because we fear it will undermine our entire organization.
But if you are confused by the unreasonable things we have to accept, then it is time for accountability.
Therefore I do not own the Gospel of Disruption, Renewal, or TBL.
Today I do not have the Gospel of faith to share with you.
In fact, what I have and what I offer is the gospel of doubt.
The Gospel of Doubt is not asking you to stop believing, it is asking you to believe something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It&#39;s possible that the answers we have are wrong, it&#39;s possible that the questions themselves are wrong,
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that on this stage, in this room, we are wrong.
Because it raises the question why?
With all the power at our fingertips, why do humans still suffer so much?
This doubt led me to get involved, and we put our organization, MBAS Across America, out of business.
We have fired our staff, closed our doors, and will share our model for free with anyone who feels they can do this work without waiting for our approval.
This doubt has forced me to abandon the role of Savior that some have assigned to me, because our time is too short and our chances are too long to wait for her second coming, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt feeds me and gives me hope that when our problems overwhelm us, when paths unfold and seem to lead to our doom, when our healers offer no relief for our wounds, it will not be our blind faith--it will be our humble doubt that sheds some light on the darkness of our lives and our world and allows us... To raise our voice to whisper
Or let us shout or simply say, very simply, “There must be another way.”
Thanks.
Food crisis.
A story that appears in the news every day
But what is it?
Food is scarce in some areas of the world, or it may be a lot.
In other areas, genetically modified foods are saving the world.
Could modified foods be the problem?
Frequent dumping of waste into the sea creates bad and toxic oceans, weakening nutrition.
And it will continue like this forever.
I find that the current climate of this debate is terribly unconstructive.
How can we bring this closer to something we can understand?
How is this apple a food crisis?
You all must have eaten an apple last week.
How old do you think this apple is from the moment it was picked?
Two weeks?
two months?
11 months - the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States
I do not expect the average to be very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, put them in cold tanks and then fill the tanks with gas -- there&#39;s actually documented evidence of cases where workers have tried to enter these environments to retrieve an apple, and they&#39;ve died, because the air inside used to slow down the apple process causes poisoning in humans.
How come none of you knew about this before?
Why didn&#39;t I know this before?
Ninety percent of the goodness of those apples -- all the antioxidants -- is gone by the time we get them.
It becomes effectively just a ball of sugar.
How did we become so poorly informed and how can we improve?
I think what we are missing is a program
I know programs - I know computers, they connected me to the Internet when I was young
I did some very strange things on this program.
But I met people, and I was able to express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we have a program, we may feel prompted to ask: What if?
For me, I asked: What if the climate was democratic?
This is a climate map of the world.
The most productive areas are in green, and the least productive areas are in red.
They exchange and change, and California farmers are now Mexican farmers.
China takes land from braille to grow better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if every country had its own productive climate?
What will this change the way we live?
What will this change in the quality of life and food?
The problem with the previous generation was, we need more food and we need it to be cheap.
Welcome to your global farm.
We built a giant model of a farm
All these traces are traces of cars, planes, trains, and wheels.
It&#39;s a miracle that we feed 7 billion people even though so few of us are involved in food production.
what if..
We built a digital farm?
Global digital farm.
What if you could take this apple, digitize it somehow, send it through molecules in the air, and put it back together at the other end?
what if?
I will read some of these sayings. They have inspired me to do what I do
The first: “Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, and no future.” This is what I landed on the day I visited Minamisanerki in southern Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children headed towards Sandai and Tokyo. The land is polluted, they import seventy percent of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Two percent of America&#39;s population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer could come from two percent of any country&#39;s population?
When we go around the world, 50 percent of Africa&#39;s population is under the age of 18
80 percent do not want to become farmers.
Farming is hard.
The life of a small shareholder farmer is miserable.
They go to town.
In India: Farmer families are unable to obtain basic services. The number of farmers who committed suicide this year and the previous year is more than the previous 10.
It&#39;s uncomfortable to talk about this.
Where are they going?
to the city.
No guys, everyone is heading there.
So how do we build this program that inspires young people?
Welcome to the new agricultural tractor.
This is my compilation.
In previous years, I went to Bed Bath, Beyond, and Home Depot and started barbering.
And I built silly things, and I made plants dance, and I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all--a lot.
In the end, I made them survive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships I&#39;ve ever had in my life, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They say, &quot;Do it, boy!&quot;
This is an old, unwanted electronic room.
What can you do?&quot;
My team and I built a farm inside the media lab, a place not known throughout history for anything about biology, but for everything about virtual life.
Within these 60 square feet we produced enough food to feed 300 people once a month--not a lot of food.
And there&#39;s a lot of exciting technology out there.
But the most exciting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors and monthly harvest.
Is this the new cafeteria?
Is this the new retail experience?
Is this the new grocery store?
I can say one thing for sure: This is the first time someone in the media lab has uprooted anything
We get salad in bags; There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.
But what happens is when you have an image-based processing expert, a data scientist, they strip down the roots and think, &quot;Huh. I know something about -- I can do this, I want to try.&quot;
In this process we will take out the plants and we will take some of them to the laboratory, because when you plant them and raise them, you do not throw them away; It&#39;s kinda precious to you.
I have this weird tongue now, because I&#39;m afraid to let someone eat anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the acidity of lettuce to a tenth of one.
I say, &quot;No, that&#39;s 6.1 -- no, no, you can&#39;t eat that today.&quot;
The lettuce that day was very sweet.
It was very sweet because the plant was stressed and had created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: “I won&#39;t die!”
And the plant that won&#39;t die tastes sweet to me.
Technology has taken a backseat in plant physiology.
So we thought other people needed to try this.
We wanted to see what people could make, so we imagined a laboratory that we could ship anywhere.
Then we made it.
So at the front of the medical laboratory comes my laboratory, which contains 30 sensor points for each plant.
If you know about genomics or genetics, this is the phenomenon, right?
The phenomenon.
When you say “I like strawberries from Mexico,” you actually like strawberries from the climate that produced the phrase you like.
So, if you&#39;re programming a climate -- the carbon dioxide and the oxygen you&#39;re creating a recipe for -- you&#39;re programming the phrase for this plant, the food for this plant, the size of this plant, its shape, its color, its texture.
We need data. So we put a bunch of sensors there to show us what&#39;s going on.
If you&#39;re thinking about your plants, and you look at them and you&#39;re so miserable because you say to them, &quot;Why are they dying? You don&#39;t want to talk to me?&quot;
Farmers developed the most beautiful astrological eyes when they were in their late 60s and 70s.
They can tell you when you see a plant dying due to a lack of nitrogen, a lack of calcium, or a need for more moisture.
These beautiful eyes are not passed down to heirs.
These eyes are in the farmer&#39;s virtual cloud.
We extend these data points over time.
We link these data points to individual plants
These are the broccoli in my lab that day, via an IP address.
Our broccoli has an IP address.
If that&#39;s not weird enough, you can click on one and get a profile of the plant,
This informs you of the development of the downloadable plant, but not as you might think, it&#39;s not just when it&#39;s ready.
When will the food I need arrive?
When will I achieve the taste I want?
Is he getting too much water?
Does it get a lot of sun?
Warnings.
He can talk to me, he&#39;s a speaker, we have a language.
I think this is the first plant user on Facebook, right?
This is the information about this plant, and this plant will start adding friends to God.
And I mean it -- it will add friends from other plants that use less nitrogen or more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn about complexities, some of which we are still guessing now.
You may not agree to our friendship -- I don&#39;t know, but you may agree to our friendship request, and it depends on our behavior.
Well, this is my lab.
It&#39;s a little better organized, and my experience comes from designing data centers in hospitals for everything, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
So -- within this environment, we run tests for all kinds of things,
This process, hydroponics, was developed on the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water carried into space.
This process works on the basis of giving the plant exactly what it needs: water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots aren&#39;t that complicated, so once you give it that, you get this amazing expression.
This is similar to a plant having two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It&#39;s a whole world.
We have gone too far down the path of technology and seed for a negative world and we will continue to do so, but we will have a new tool, too, which is an integrated world.
Well we planted all kinds of things.
These tomatoes have not been produced commercially for 150 years.
Did you know that we have stores of rare and ancient seeds?
Seed drains or banks.
Something amazing.
It has living origins and things you&#39;ve never eaten before.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this type of tomato.
The problem is that it was in the form of tomato paste, which we do not know how to cook, so we ate tomato paste and it was not very tasty.
We&#39;ve done a lot with protein...we&#39;ve raised all kinds of things
We even raised humans... well maybe you could, but we didn&#39;t.
But what we were certain of was that the tool was very large and very expensive.
I started distributing it around the world and it was worth about $100,000.
It&#39;s not easy to find someone with $100,000 in their back pocket, so we wanted to do something small.
And this project was actually for one of my students -- a mechanical engineer named Camille.
And Camille and I and my team, we went back and forth over the whole summer about how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it so other people can make it.
Then we distributed it in schools between the seventh and eleventh grades.
And if you really want to be humiliated, try teaching a child something
And so I walked into that school and said, &quot;Set it up to 65% humidity.&quot;
One seventh grader said, &quot;What is humidity?&quot;
And I said, &quot;Ha, it&#39;s the water in the air.&quot;
He said, &quot;There&#39;s no water in the air, you stupid.&quot;
So I said something like, “Well, don&#39;t trust me.
Actually--don&#39;t trust me, right?
Set it to 100.
So he set it to 100, so what happened?
It began to condense, creating a mist and then began to drip.
And he said, &quot;Oh. Humidity is rain.&quot;
Why didn&#39;t you simply tell me that?&quot;
We&#39;ve set up communication for this very much like a game.
They have a three-dimensional environment that they can access from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or small computers.
They have different parts of the media - physical, sensors.
They choose recipes created by other kids anywhere in the world.
They choose the recipe, run it, and plant a seed
And as they grow they make changes?
They say, for example, “Why does a plant need carbon dioxide?
Isn&#39;t it bad?&quot;
If we increase the gas, the plant will die
If we lower it, the plant grows well.
Harvest the plant, and you have created a new digital recipe.
It is an interactive design, development and exploration process.
Then they can save that, and all the data about the new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what it did -- was it better or worse?
Imagine this as a mini hub of operations.
We will learn a lot.
And this is one of the food computers, as we call it, in a school after three weeks.
That&#39;s three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it&#39;s the first time this boy has ever thought about becoming a farmer -- or that he would ever want to be a farmer.
That&#39;s why we opened all of this to the public.
It&#39;s online, go home and try to build your first food computer.
It&#39;s going to be difficult - that&#39;s what I&#39;m telling you.
We are at the beginning, but it is all there.
It&#39;s important to me that entry is easy
We will continue to try to make it easier.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, botanist, economist, urban planner.
They work on the basis of what they do best.
But we have grown up a little more.
This is my facility that I just started working in.
The warehouse can be anywhere.
That&#39;s why I chose it.
And inside this repository we will build something like this, for example.
And it exists now.
Look at it well.
It actually exists too.
One of them raises vegetables, and another raises an Ebola vaccine.
It&#39;s great that these plants and the winner of the big Defense Advanced Research Agency award are one of the reasons we&#39;re ahead of Ebola.
Plants produce Ebola-resistant protein.
As well as pharmacists and nutritionists, down to lettuce.
But these two things are not similar to each other, and here I appear with my field.
Everything is different.
We&#39;ve reached this strange &quot;all&#39;s good&quot; situation, which is like saying, &quot;This is my black box --&quot; and &quot;No, they bought my box.&quot;
“No, no, no — I have very valuable intellectual property rights.
&quot;They bought my box, not his.&quot;
The truth is that we are still at the beginning, at a time when society is also moving.
When we ask for more cheap food, we are not asking for better environmentally friendly food.
And when McDonald&#39;s announces what&#39;s in chicken balls, the strangest food of all time -- and they base their marketing plan on that -- everything changes.
Now let&#39;s enter the world.
Private catering computers, caterers and catering data centers operate on an open platform.
Think of an open genetic map, but we will put in it small climate recipes, like Wikipedia, whose pages can be closed, occupied and developed.
What in the world does this look like?
Do you remember that the world is connected by threads?
We started to find lighthouses.
We started sending information about food, instead of sending food.
This is not my imagination, this is what we are actually publishing now.
Food computers, food servers, and soon food data centers, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting over what&#39;s bad about it.
We know what&#39;s bad about this.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and empowering them with a base to ask and answer the question, &quot;What if?&quot;
Thank you all
There are times when I feel really ashamed to be European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response was, frankly, pathetic.
There are many contradictions,
We deeply mourned the tragic death of the two-year-old Kurdish boy, and since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, but we have accepted that small Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe.
We are sorry that people smugglers exist, but we have made it the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a labor shortage, but we have excluded those people who meet our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We profess our liberal values in opposition to fanatical Islam, but we have oppressive policies that hinder asylum-seeking children, separate children from their families, and seize refugee property.
What do we do?
How did the situation reach this point, that we adopt this inhumane policy to confront this humanitarian crisis?
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because people don&#39;t care, or at least I don&#39;t want to believe it.
But I think this is because our politicians lack a vision, a vision of how an international refugee system created more than 50 years ago can embrace a changing, globalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, we all need to ask the two questions,
The first question is, why is the current system not working?
Second, what can we do to fix this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the wake of World War II by these men.
Its primary goal is to ensure that when the state fails, or worse, the regime turns against its people, people find a place to go, to live in security and dignity until they can return to their homeland.
It was created specifically for situations like the one we see in Syria today,
Through an international agreement signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the International Commission of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has specified that states must reciprocate the treatment of people on their territories who are fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
But in practice, our immigration policies are based on cutting off the path to safety.
In theory, the refugee has the right to be integrated into society, or to be returned to the country from which he came,
But in reality, their fate remains forgotten indefinitely.
In theory, the refugee issue is a shared global responsibility.
But in practice, geography means that countries close to conflict take in the vast majority of the world&#39;s refugees.
This system is not broken because its rules are wrong.
We have not applied it adequately in this changing world, and this is what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
But not from the top down from an institutional perspective, rather from a refugee perspective.
So imagine a Syrian woman,
And let&#39;s call her princess,
For me, Amira represents many of the people I met in the region.
Amira, representing about 25 percent of the refugees in the world, is a woman with children, and she cannot return to their homes because she came from this city that you see in front of you, which is Homs, a city that was once beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
So Amira cannot go there.
It also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that lottery ticket is only available to less than one percent of the world&#39;s refugees.
Therefore, Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that Amira can take her family to the camp,
In which it is possible to get help, but there are very few expectations for Amira and her family.
The camps are in bleak, barren places, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of shells at night across the border in Syria.
There is restricted economic activity.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around the world, about 80 percent of refugees living in camps must remain there for at least five years.
It is a miserable life, and perhaps this is the reason, in fact, that only nine percent of Syrians resort to this option.
Alternatively, Amira can go to urban areas to nearby cities, such as Amman or Beirut.
This option was taken by about 75 percent of Syrian refugees.
But there is also a great difficulty,
Refugees in these urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They usually cannot access aid,
So when Amira and her family used their basic savings, they were more likely to face urban poverty.
Therefore, there is a third alternative for them, and this is the reason why our refugee numbers have increased
Where a princess can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous journey to another country, and this is what we are witnessing in Europe today.
Around the world, we are faced with refugees who often have no other choice between the three options of camp, poverty in nearby urban areas, or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this option is today&#39;s global refugee system.
But I think it&#39;s a wrong choice.
And we can reconsider this choice.
The reason behind reducing these options is that we believe that these are the only options available to refugees, and there are no other options.
Politicians have framed the issue as a zero-sum issue, such that if we benefit from refugees, we will impose costs on citizens.
We tend to collectively assume that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden on society.
But this is not necessary and they can contribute to society,
What I would like to suggest is that we can expand those options so that everyone benefits: host countries and communities, our communities and the refugees themselves.
So I would like to suggest four ways in which we can change the way we think about the refugee issue.
All four of these roads have a common denominator: they are the same roads that bring us to globalization, mobility and markets, and modernize the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first way I like to think about it is the idea of enabling environments, which starts from a fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Together with colleagues at Oxford, I embarked on a research project in Uganda on the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is representative of all host countries.
not like that. Rather, it is exceptional.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunities,
It gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences are extraordinary for both refugees and host communities.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own businesses that employ other people, and 40 percent of these employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional examples of thriving and vibrant entrepreneurial companies.
For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
We found a Rwandan who runs a business that allows young people to play computer games from recycled TVs and toys,
Unlike the restrictions placed on them elsewhere, refugees are innovating, and the man you see before you is a Congolese called Dimo-Kai.
Daimyo-Kai arrived at this settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a way out.
So he started a local radio station, with a group of friends and colleagues, rented a video camera, and is now a filmmaker.
He made two documentaries with our team, and succeeded in establishing a business from very little.
It&#39;s those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities that seek human flourishing.
Yes, clothing, blankets, shelter and food are all important in the emergency phase, but we also have to look beyond that.
We need to provide access to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the approaches we take to access the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second idea that I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world practiced the same methods as I did.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still alternative realistic options we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, accompanied by development economist Paul Collier, and an idea came to mind while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to provide job opportunities for Syrians by supporting the Jordanian National Development Strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into work alongside the employment of Jordanian host citizens.
Just 15 minutes from Zaatari camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is the current economic zone called the King Hussein bin Talal Development Zone.
The government spent more than a hundred million dollars to connect it to the electricity grid and roads, but it lacks two things: access to work and internal investment.
What if refugees were able to work there instead of being stuck in camps, they would be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they return to Syria?
We realize that Jordan can benefit from this, and its development strategy requires a qualitative leap from a middle-income country to a manufacturing country.
It can benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to the post-conflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the best resource for ultimately rebuilding Syria.
We published the idea in Foreign Affairs magazine.
King Abdullah picked up this idea,
It was announced in London at the Syria conference two weeks ago, and its implementation will begin next summer.
The third idea that I want to put in your hands is the harmonious preference between countries and refugees in order to reach happy results like the ones you see here in the personal photos that include Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, and where they want to go, but what matters to me is that we can do that and make everyone better off.
Economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of homogeneous markets, in such ways that the order of preference of the parties constitutes ultimate homogeneity.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teitelboim have come up with ways to apply this idea to refugees by asking refugees about their favorite places, but it also allows countries to classify the types of refugees they want to host based on skill criteria or language criteria and allow them to engage.
Now, of course you need to build in stakes like diversity and vulnerability but that&#39;s the way to increase the possibility of inclusion
The idea of integration has been used successfully, for example, to engage students in universities, and to engage kidney donors with patients, and lies behind the algorithms found on dating sites.
So why don&#39;t we implement the idea of giving refugees greater choices?
It can also be used at the national level. As one of the major challenges we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees,
Right now, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities, and this makes no sense at all.
Therefore, homogeneity of markets provides a potential means of achieving these preferences together and listening to the needs and demands of the host population and refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put in your hands is humanitarian visas.
Much of the tragedy and chaos we saw in Europe could have been completely avoided.
It starts from the fundamental contradiction in Europe&#39;s asylum policy, which is the following: in order to obtain asylum in Europe, you have to come spontaneously through those perilous journeys that I have described.
But why should such dangerous trips be necessary in the age of budget airlines and modern embassy capabilities?
These are completely unnecessary trips, and last year, they led to the death of more than 3,000 people on Europe’s borders and within European territories.
If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that, and there is a way to do that through something called a humanitarian visa, which allows people to obtain a visa at an embassy or consulate of a neighboring country where they simply pay for their journey by ship or flight to Europe.
About 1,000 euros is the cost to smuggle a refugee from Türkiye to the Greek islands.
While it costs 200 euros to travel by economic flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allow refugees to do this, it will have huge positives
It will save lives, we will completely cut off the smuggling market, and it will eliminate the chaos that we see on Europe&#39;s front line in areas such as the Greek islands.
It&#39;s politics that prevents us from doing this instead of a rational solution,
This idea was applied,
Brazil has relied on a pioneering method, whereby more than 2,000 Syrians were able to obtain humanitarian visas, and when they entered Brazil, they were given a refugee status.
Every Syrian in this project enjoys refugee status and is recognized as a genuine refugee.
There is another historical precedent as well,
Between 1922 and 1942, these passports were used as travel documents to allow 45,000 Armenians, Chechens and Turks to travel across Europe and obtain refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
The International Office for Refugees won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this workable strategy.
So all the four ideas I presented to you are a way through which we can expand Amira&#39;s options,
They are ways in which we can have great choices for refugees beyond the three impossible basic choices I have explained to you in order to leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, one that expands refugees&#39; options but recognizes that they do not have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yes, it is a humanitarian issue and a responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents and ambitions, and they have the ability to contribute... if we allow them to.
In the New World, immigration is not going away.
What we saw in Europe will be with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, they will continue to be displaced from their homes, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this... not based on the old logic of humanitarian aid, not based on the logic of philanthropy, but based on building the opportunities that mobility and globalized markets provide. ,
I assure you that we must wake up from our slumber and urge politicians to wake up and face this challenge.
Thank you very much .
When I was a little kid, I always dreamed of the ocean.
It was a wild place full of color and life, home to these strange, fantastical creatures.
I photographed the large sharks that dominate the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing around coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I&#39;ve spent most of my career searching for magical places like the ones I dreamed of when I was young.
You see, I started discovering the sea at a relatively young age.
But the first time I dived into deep water, I was ten years old.
I still remember well when I was swimming furiously to reach that old cannon covered in shallow coral reefs.
When I finally reached it, I looked up and was surrounded by fish in all the colors of the rainbow.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Conservation Photographer In my 40th year on this planet, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to discover some stunning seascapes for National Geographic magazine and the Protect Our Seas Foundation.
I&#39;ve photographed everything from huge sharks to ones that fit in the palm of my hand.
“I inhaled the fishy scent of humpback whales feeding just feet from me in the cold seas of Canada on the shore of the Great Bear Rainforest.”
I was familiar with the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Strait.
Every person on this planet is affected by and affected by the ocean.
The ancient, clean seas I dreamed of as a child are now very difficult to find.
The seas are becoming more stressed and more threatened.
We as humans still maintain our role as predators on Earth, and I have witnessed and photographed many of these direct effects.
For a long time, I thought I would shock my audience into their indifference with some disturbing images.
Although this approach has advantages, I went back to the beginning.
I believe that the best way to change is to sell love.
I guess I play a bit of a &#39;suitor&#39; and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to uncover the animals and entire ecosystems that lie beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can&#39;t fall in love with something and become a champion of it if you don&#39;t know it exists.
By revealing this--this is the power of conservation photography.
I have visited hundreds of marine sites, but only a few seascapes have captured my attention and had a profound impact.
The first time I experienced that altitude was about 10 years ago, off the rugged and wild coast of South Africa.
In June and July, huge swarms of sardines travel north in a mass migration that we call the “sardine flight.”
And those fish have good reason to escape.
They are chased by predatory and agile animals.
Dolphins hunt in combination and can disperse a school of sardines to create small, enticing schools of fish.
She lures the fish to the surface of the ocean and then they rush off to dinner to celebrate.
It is believed that sharks are behind this.
Now, most people think that both sharks and dolphins are deadly enemies, but during the “sardine escape,” they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks feed effectively.
Without the dolphins&#39; help, food balls are more common and the sharks often end up eating so-called sardine donuts, or with a mouth full of water.
Now, after having some exciting moments with sharks during the “sardine escape,” I know they don’t see me as prey.
However, I get slapped like any other guest during this very noisy feast.
From the shores of Africa, let us travel to the east, through the vast Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays travel across the archipelago to a small spot on Baa Atoll called Habiru.
Large groups of crustaceans, most of which are no larger than the size of an eye, are the primary food of manta rays.
When the amount of algal vegetation becomes minimal, manta rays feed on their own and often turn around, like a puppy chasing its tail.
Whereas, when the amount of algae plants increases, the manta rays line up behind each other to form a long food chain, and if the first fish cannot eat the food, of course the next fish will grab it.
The lower the amount of algae in the Gulf, the closer the manta rays are to each other, a unique behavior called tornado feeding.
As they hover in a tight formation, this group of manta rays creates a kind of tornado, sucking up the algae and bringing it to their mouths.
The experience of diving among hundreds of manta rays is truly a unique and unforgettable experience.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, this area was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with NGOs such as the Manta Trust, my photos inevitably helped the Hanifaru area become a reserve.
Now, fishermen from neighboring islands once caught manta rays to make traditional drums from the skin of these fish.
Today, they are among the most ardent conservationists and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy more than $8 million every year.
I&#39;ve always wanted to go back in time to an era when maps were mostly blank or they read, &quot;There is a dragon.&quot;
Today, the closest I&#39;ve been to the remote islands of the western Indian Ocean.
Far from the shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving in these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once were.
Few people have heard of Passas da Andia, a small patch of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
It is a coral reef that represents a protective outer barrier, and the inner lagoon is a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks were shy even during the day.
I had a feeling they would be bolder and more numerous at night.
I have never encountered so many sharks on coral outcrops.
Capturing moments like this and sharing them with everyone -- it reminds me why I chose this path.
Sometime during this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic magazine in Baja California.
About halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side is San Ignacio Lagoon, a birthplace for gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast witnessed a massacre, with more than 20,000 gray whales killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today the descendants of those same whales bring their young children to the surface to play and even interact with us.
This species has really seen a remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Belmo, a sleepy fishing island.
Decades of indiscriminate hunting have caused the collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to declare its waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing short of a miracle.
In 2005, after only a decade of protection, scientists measured the extent of the fish&#39;s recovery.
But don&#39;t hear a word from me--come with me.
With just one breath, they dived with me into the depths of one of the largest fish habitats I have ever encountered.
We all have the ability to create some kind of hope.
Through my photography, I want to spread a message: it is not too late to protect our oceans.
I want to focus in particular on the flexibility and adaptability of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will look more and more to make images like this, and create images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
I hope it becomes a daily occurrence for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist.
And always operate on the assumption that the great photo that will make a difference is only very close by, behind the next coral, in the next lake or perhaps in the next lake.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was the foundation of Zimbabwe&#39;s national health policy.
The new government emerged after a long war for independence and immediately announced a socialist programme: both health care and primary education became essentially free.
There has been a large spread of rural health centers, where approximately 80% of the population can reach these services in less than two hours on foot, which is a huge achievement of its kind.
In 1980, the year of independence, about 25% of children in Zimbabwe were vaccinated.
By 1990, just a decade later, this percentage had reached 80%.
I felt very proud to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
That sense of excitement and friendship was palpable.
Working alongside brilliant Zimbabwean citizens--scientists, doctors, and activists--I felt connected not only to the African independence movement, but also to the public health movement in progress.
But there were huge challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year it was introduced.
I cared for a number of people with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what was in store in Africa.
The infection rate went up about 2% during the first days I was there.
This could rise for one in four adults 17 years from the time I left Harare.
By the middle of 1990, I knew of hundreds of people in a very young year who had become infected with HIV.
I saw many colleagues and friends die, my students and hospital patients, die.
In response to these situations, I and my colleagues established a hospital.
We carried out several interventions to explain condom use.
We conducted interventions in education and work settings.
We did research. We provided guidance to female partners of infected men on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard and at the time I thought I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, as it was.
But I wasn&#39;t talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke about his personal failure that led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was head of the United Nations Peacekeeping Department.
On the 10-year anniversary of the genocide, he said: “I thought I was doing my best, but after the genocide I realized that there were a lot of things I could have done or should have done to sound the alarm and come together to provide support.”
The AIDS epidemic devastated the health of an unprepared society, and today the World Health Organization estimates that nearly 39 million people have died from this disease. I am not the only one who is filled with regret and remorse for not having done more things sooner.
But while I was living in Zimbabwe, I didn&#39;t see myself as an advocate or politician.
I was there to improve my technical skills, my skills related to my epidemiological research
In my mind, my vocation was to care for patients and do research to better understand transmission patterns in populations and, I hoped, slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially marginalized strata of the population were most at risk of contracting AIDS and dying.
On sugarcane plantations, which resemble a feudal system more than any modern institution, 60% of pregnant women are recorded as being infected with HIV.
I have worked to clarify that the injury is not related to moral decay, but rather to the culture of male superiority, forced migrant labor, and colonialism.
As health professionals, our tools were very limited: we called on people to change their individual behaviour, use condoms and limit the number of partners.
Infection rates rose, and when treatment became available in the West, the treatment that remains our most powerful weapon against this virus, the treatment was not available to the public sector in Africa.
I did not mention the unequal access to these life-saving medicines or the underlying economic and political systems that account for infection rates across much of the population.
I justified my silence by reminding myself that I was only a guest in this country. Sounding the alarm could get me fired, preventing me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, and doing the research I so desperately need.
So I didn&#39;t talk about the government&#39;s early position on AIDS.
I didn&#39;t express my concerns loudly enough.
Some doctors and health professionals will think that I haven&#39;t done anything wrong.
Our agreement with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its derivatives, centers on the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.
I did everything I could for each of my patients.
But I knew that epidemics emerge through the cleavages that exist in our society, which reflect not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion, and discrimination related to race, gender, social classes, and others.
This is true for AIDS.
This was true recently in the case of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who has studied AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because abuses are embedded in the organization at the economic and political level of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power, and since violence is a reflection-- Premature death, suffering, disease - it is a form of violence.
We do little for our patients if we fail to regulate these social inequalities.
Sounding the alarm is the first stage in spreading the right to public health, and it is the way to combine support efforts to get out of this situation and achieve some kind of change together.
So these days, I won&#39;t stay quiet anymore.
I will talk about many things, even if the listeners don&#39;t feel comfortable, even if I don&#39;t feel comfortable either.
Much of what I will say will be about racial and ethnic disparities in institutions, things that should never exist in this country, and certainly should not exist in the practice of medicine or public health.
But they are there, and we are paying them to end our lives prematurely.
That is why the alarm bell must be sounded about the impact of racism on health in the United States of America, and the continuing violence between individuals and within institutions and black people, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow laws and 60 years of disturbed equality, Ringing the alarm about this is essential and central to doing my job right as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature death -- meaning death before age 65 -- is 50 percent higher for blacks than for whites.
A black woman in 2012 was 10 times more likely to die at birth than a white woman.
Although we have made tremendous strides in reducing infant mortality, black infants face nearly three times the risk of death in their first year compared to white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics are matched by other statistics across the United States.
A recent analysis in the New York Times proved that 1.5 million black people are missing.
They noted that more than one in six black men between the ages of 25 and 45 have gone missing, disappeared from daily life, gone to prison or died prematurely.
This is a huge inequality in the daily and inappropriate violence that young black men face, and recent protests have centered around the slogan #BlackLivesMatter.
But we must remember that the ever-changing rates and consequences of common medical conditions--heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS--are diseases that can kill slowly and quietly and take many black lives prematurely.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement spread, I became frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word “racism” in our research and studies.
You probably felt something every time I said that word.
Our medical students protested Day-Ins in their white blouses, but the medical community passively supported this since discrimination still affected the level of morbidity of people and deaths.
And I&#39;m concerned that the trend around precision and personalized medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to develop better treatments, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture of the topic, which is the day-to-day context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, and most importantly, determines the health of the population. And, for many of us, “poor health.”
As health professionals, in our daily work, whether in hospital or when doing research, we witness great inequalities: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities, the transgender youth who contemplate suicide because our society is too cruel, A single mother who must feel responsible for her son&#39;s poor health.
Our role as health professionals is not only to treat our patients, but to ring the alarm and call for change.
Whether this is credible or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and this should not be neglected.
I regret not speaking out in Zimbabwe, and I made a promise to myself that, as New York City Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I get to ring the alarm and join forces to support health equity.
I will speak out against racism and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out about sexism or any other form of equality.
It is time for us to all stand up and speak out about structural inequality.
We do not have to have all the answers to advocate for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, and the health of all of us, depends on it.
Okay, by a show of hands, how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive related to politics, religion, child protection or food?
How many of you try to ignore at least one person because you simply don&#39;t want to talk to them?
You know, we just had to follow Henry Higgins&#39; advice in My Fair Lady: stick to talking about the weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and the fight against vaccines, those topics -- they&#39;re not safe either.
Therefore, this world in which we live, this world in which every conversation has the potential to turn into an argument, where politicians cannot talk to each other and where even the most trivial issues are passionately fought for or against, is not normal.
Pew Research studied 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, and more divided, than at any time in history.
We are unlikely to reach a compromise, and this means that we do not listen to each other,
We make decisions about where we live, who we marry, and even who our friends will be, based on what we already believe.
Again, this means we are not listening to each other.
Conversation requires a balance between speaking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lose that balance.
Now, part of that comes down to technology.
Smartphones that are either in your hands or close enough that they can be accessed quickly
According to Pew Research, about a third of Americans send more than 100 messages a day.
Many of them, almost all of them, are more likely to exchange messages with their friends than to see them face to face.
There&#39;s an excellent article in The Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
As he gave his children a communication project.
He said he wanted to teach them how to talk about a certain topic without using notes.
&quot;I realized...&quot; he said.
I realized that mastery of conversation is perhaps one of the skills we fail to teach most.
Children spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to hone interpersonal communication skills.
This question may seem funny, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any skill more important in the 21st century than being able to maintain a coherent and confident conversation? &quot;
Now, I&#39;m talking directly to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, and plumbers.
I talk to people I love. I talk to people I don&#39;t like,
I talk to some people with whom I deeply disagree on a personal level.
But I still had a great conversation with them.
So I would like to devote the next 10 minutes to teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like looking someone in the eye while speaking, thinking in advance of interesting topics to discuss, looking and nodding to show you are paying attention, repeating or summarizing what you have just heard.
I want you to forget all that.
Because that&#39;s stupid!
There is no reason for you to learn how to show attention if you are actually paying attention.
Now, I actually use the same skills in job interviews that I do in regular life.
So, I&#39;m going to teach you how to meet people, and this will actually help you learn how to be a better communicator.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time and without getting bored, for God&#39;s sake, without offending anyone.
We&#39;ve all had important conversations before.
We&#39;ve done it before, we know what it looks like.
The kind of conversation in which you walk away and feel inspired, or in which you feel deeply connected or perfectly understood.
There&#39;s no reason most of your relationships shouldn&#39;t be the same as before.
So I have 10 basic rules that I&#39;m going to explain to you, but honestly, if you just pick one of them and apply it, you&#39;ll have a great conversation.
Number one: Don&#39;t multitask.
And I don&#39;t mean here to leave your mobile phone, tablet, car keys, or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean is, be present.
live in the moment.
Don&#39;t think about the argument you had with your boss.
Don&#39;t think about what you&#39;re going to eat for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don&#39;t be half in and half out of the conversation!
Secondly: Do not cling to your opinion.
If you would like to express your opinion without giving any opportunity to respond, discuss, or add to and develop your idea, write a blog.
Now, there&#39;s a really good reason why I don&#39;t let critics on my show: because they&#39;re really boring.
If they were conservative, they would hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If they were liberals, they would hate big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
We can completely predict this.
And you don&#39;t want to be like that
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something you want to learn.
As the famous therapist Scott Peck said, proper listening requires putting oneself aside.
Sometimes this means canceling your personal opinion.
He said that if we feel this acceptance, the speaker will become less vulnerable and more likely to open up what is on his mind and what is inside his mind to the listener.
Again, let&#39;s say you want to learn something.
As Bill Nye said, “Everyone you meet knows something you don&#39;t.”
I put it this way: Everyone is an expert at something.
Third: Use open questions.
In this case, the reference is journalists
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complex question you will get an easy answer.
If I asked you, &quot;Were you terrified?&quot;
You will respond to the strongest word in the sentence, which is “terrified,” and the answer will be “Yes, I was” or “No, I was not.”
&quot;Were you angry?&quot; “Yes, I was very angry.”
Let them describe it, they are the ones who know.
Try asking them questions like “How was that?”
&quot;How did that feel?&quot;
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and so you&#39;ll get more interesting answers.
Fourth: Go with the flow.
This means that thoughts will come to your mind and what you need to do is make these thoughts come out of your mind.
I&#39;ve often heard interviews in which guests talk for several minutes and then the host comes back and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere or has already been answered.
This means that the host stopped listening for two minutes because he thought of this genius question and was determined to say it.
We do the same method.
We are sitting with someone having a conversation, and suddenly we remember that day when we met Hugh Jackman in the café.
And we stop listening.
Stories and ideas that will come to your mind,
You need to let these thoughts come and go.
Fifth: If you don&#39;t know, say you don&#39;t know.
People on radio, especially on stations like NPR, are much more aware that they&#39;re recording, and so they&#39;re more careful about the things they claim to be experts on and the things they claim to be confident about.
Do this with caution.
Talk should not be cheap.
Sixth: Do not compare your experience with theirs.
If they are talking about losing a family member, do not talk about the time you lost someone in your family.
If they are talking about some problems they face at work, don&#39;t talk to them about how much you hate your job.
The issue is not the same, and it will never be the same.
Each experience can be taken separately.
Most importantly, it&#39;s not about you.
You don&#39;t need to talk and try to show how amazing a person you are or how much you suffered in the past.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking about his IQ, and he said: “I have no idea. Because people who brag about their IQ are losers.”
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Seventh: Do not try to repeat yourself.
Because that is a kind of self-depreciation and boredom, and we do that a lot.
Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our children, we want to get a certain meaning, so we just rephrase it over and over.
Don&#39;t do that.
Eighth: Stay away from harmful weeds.
What I mean, frankly, is that people don&#39;t care about years, names, dates, and all these details that they struggle to remember.
They don&#39;t care about that and what they care about is you.
They care about what you like, and what you have in common.
So, forget these details and leave them.
Ninth: This is not the last point, but the most important point.
Listen.
I can&#39;t tell you how many people have told you that listening is possibly the most important skill they can develop.
Buddha said, and I am paraphrasing for you, “If your mouth is open, you will not learn.”
Calvin Coolidge said, “No one has ever lost a job because he listened too much.”
Why don&#39;t we hear each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am under control.
I don&#39;t need to hear anything I&#39;m not interested in.
So I will be the center of attention.
I can strengthen my identity.
But there is another reason: our attention gets distracted.
The average person speaks approximately 225 words per minute, but we can hear 500 words per minute.
So our minds are busy and full of 275 words like that.
I also know that it takes energy and effort to pay attention to someone, and if you can&#39;t do that then you&#39;re not really talking.
Rather, you are two people screaming and barely uttering a few sentences in the same place.
So we have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it beautifully.
“Most of us don&#39;t listen with the intention of understanding,” he said.
But he only listens with the intention of responding.”
Another rule, which is the tenth rule, is to keep speech short.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt. It is short enough to attract attention, and long enough to cover the private parts - My sister] All of this boils down to the same basic concept, which is: Be interested in others.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there were certain rituals in my house.
People would come to talk to my grandparents, and after they left, my mother would come up to us, and say, &quot;Do you know who that was?&quot;
She was runner-up for Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
It won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a famous Russian ballet dancer.”
So I was raised with this assumption that everyone has something special hidden from them.
And honestly, I think that&#39;s what made me a better hostess.
Which is that I try as much as possible to keep my mouth shut, my mind open, and I am always ready to be amazing, and I have never been disappointed.
And you should do the same thing.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly be prepared to be amazed.
Thanks
Welcome.
My name is Matthew Williams. I&#39;m a hero.
I won medals in three different sports and at the National Games in Canada, I played internationally in basketball and I am proud to have represented Canada on the global level.
I train five days a week in basketball and speed skating, and I work with top-level coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best I can be in my sport.
By the way, all during the Special Olympics.
Does this change your idea of me and my accomplishments?
The world does not consider people like me to be heroes.
Not long ago, people like me were outcasts and hidden away.
Much has changed since the launch of the Special Olympics in 1968, but in many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to others everywhere.
People use insulting words in front of me and think it doesn&#39;t matter.
The word &quot;late&quot; or &quot;late&quot; is used in a derogatory way.
They don&#39;t care how much I or my friends hurt.
I don&#39;t want you to think that I&#39;m here because I represent a humanitarian cause.
And I&#39;m here because there is still a big problem with the way people treat people with intellectual disabilities, or, more often, don&#39;t care about them at all.
Did you know that the World Games were organized this year?
I was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in Los Angeles.
There were more than 62,000 spectators watching the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSN and ESPN.
Do you know what happened?
What comes to your mind when you see someone like me?
I&#39;m here today to challenge you to see us as equals.
Special Olympics brings about a change in the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and in the perceptions of followers.
For those who aren&#39;t familiar, Special Olympics is geared toward athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympics and Paralympic Games.
We provide high-quality mobile sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that can bring changes to their lives and thoughts.
This activity changed my life and the lives of many others.
It changed the way the world looks at those with intellectual disabilities.
She was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
As I got older, I played hockey until I was 12,
The older I got, the more difficult it felt to communicate with everyone, and the angry and frustrated I became.
I didn&#39;t do any sports for a while, I didn&#39;t have many friends and I felt abandoned and sad.
There was a period when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society.
It never occurred to them that they could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the physical fitness of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have concluded that the lack of opportunity to participate causes physical fitness to suffer.
Many have questioned the extent to which people with intellectual disabilities benefit from fitness programs and opportunities beyond athletic competition.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founders of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympians have been proven right more than four and a half million times.
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, insecure, and didn&#39;t have a lot of friends.
When I got there, everyone was encouraging, supporting you and letting you be yourself without any prejudice.
I am now a basketball player and skater who has competed in several competitions at the regional and national levels, and this year I was able to join the World Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first Canadian to join the basketball team and compete at the World Games level.
I&#39;m one of over four million five hundred athletes from around the world, and I&#39;ve heard many similar stories.
Being Special Olympics athletes allowed us to regain our self-esteem and dignity.
Special Olympics addresses critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than normal men, and that women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than those without disabilities.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy by being active and participating in sports.
The trainers taught us nutritional and health rules.
Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with a direct doctor or obtaining health care.
At the 2015 Summer World Games, I played with members of my Canadian team against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian basketball team underwent a World Games athlete health screening, where 7 out of 10 players received free headphones and were able to hear clearly for the first time.
The change in them was amazing.
They were more motivated, happier and confident, because their coach was able to communicate with them with words.
And they were emotional because they could hear the sound of the basketball, the sound of the whistle, the fans in the stands -- it seems like a given and a given.
Special Olympics doesn&#39;t just change athletes.
You also change their lives off the field.
This year, research shows that nearly half of adults in the United States do not even know someone with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans who have no personal contact with people with an intellectual disability are less accepting and positive of others.
Then there are those hurtful and insulting words that prove that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to many people.
People use it as if it were just passing words or a way to insult.
I mentioned it in tweets more than nine million times last year, and it was very painful for me and the four million five hundred athletes around the world.
Not many people consider it an insult, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global envoy John Franklin Stevens wrote in an open letter to political pundits who used it as an insult, “Join us one day in the Special Olympics.
Let&#39;s see if you leave and nothing has changed inside you.&quot;
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people stood in line for hours to attend the finals of the weightlifting competition.
Everyone just stood up when my colleague Jackie Barrett, the huge Newfoundland native, deadlifted 655 pounds and squatted 611 pounds. This sets a new record in the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among all Newfoundland athletes - not just in Special Olympics, but in weightlifting as a whole.
Jackie was a shining star in Los Angeles, and she was impressed by his performances.
Fifty years ago, few believed people with intellectual disabilities could do anything like this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the iconic Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and cheer on athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden away, we were encouraged and celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes confidence and self-pride.
The Special Olympics taught the world that people with special needs deserve respect and inclusion.
I now have my dreams and ambitions associated with this sport, good coaches, respect and dignity, good health, and a career as a personal trainer.
I&#39;m no longer one of those people who hide and get bullied, and here I am giving a TED Talk.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you can see their potential.
The next time someone next to you uses those mean words, please let them know the pain they leave behind.
Please consider participating in Special Olympics.
I would like to complete my speech with a final thought.
As Nelson Mandela said, “Sport has the power to make a difference in the world.”
Special Olympics works to change the world by bringing about changes in four million five hundred athletes and making it possible for us to be confident in ourselves, to meet friends, not to make prejudgments, to feel that feeling and to be champions.
Thank you very much.
You may not have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Orwa, Nigeria before.
But I know they are the most unusual places on Earth.
In the hospitals there, a community of nurses, doctors and scientists have been quietly fighting one of the most deadly threats to humanity for years: the Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
It can cause high fever and is often fatal.
But these people put their lives on the line every day to protect the people in their communities, and in doing so, they protect us all.
But one of the most unusual things I learned about them on one of my first visits there many years ago was that they started every morning -- these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- with singing.
They come together and show their joy.
They show their souls.
And over the years, year after year when I visit them and they visit me, I meet with them and sing and write and we love this, because this reminds us that we are not here to just pursue science together, we are connected together by our common humanity.
This certainly, as you can imagine, has become very important, even essential, as something to initiate change.
This changed a big deal in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This is the first epidemic in West Africa, next to the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
This was scary, scary for all of us.
We actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were spreading more than expected, and we said that it might one day come to Kenema.
So some members of my team immediately came out and joined Dr. Humar Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to get partial susceptibility tests to catch Ebola if it comes across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We had already prepared these tests for the Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team was great.
We just had to give them the tools and the place to scout for Ebola
Unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman entered the hospital&#39;s maternity ward, and the team performed these important molecular tests and identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an exceptional job done.
They were able to diagnose the condition immediately, treat the patient safely and initiate a follow-up call to find out what was happening.
You&#39;ve stopped something.
But by that day, the epidemic had been raging for months?
With hundreds of cases, it has already surpassed all previous epidemics.
He came to Sierra Leone not as an isolated case, but as a big wave.
We had to work with the global community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema. Let&#39;s start confronting those cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that is able to confront this.
And we worked around the clock trying to do as much as we could, trying to help these people, trying to get attention, but we also did something else simple.
From that sample that we took from the patient&#39;s blood to discover Ebola, we can extract it, clearly.
The other thing we can do, actually, is we stop it chemically, put it in a box and then send it across the ocean, and that&#39;s what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works
We worked around the clock, dividing the work into shifts, day after day, and quickly produced 99 genomes for the Ebola virus.
This is the blueprint - the viral genome is the blueprint.
We all have one.
It says everything within us, and it says a lot of information.
The result of such work is simple and powerful.
We can actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we can see, actually by comparing three genes, and this has happened before and spread from Guinea, we can show the beginning of the outbreak in Guinea months ago, once in humans, and then it spread from human to human.
Now, this is very important when you&#39;re trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is tracking.
We can also see that the virus mutates during its transmission between humans.
And every mutation of this is very important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the treatments that we use, they&#39;re all based on this genetic sequence, basically -- that&#39;s what drives it.
And so global health experts have to respond, they have to evolve, to examine everything they were doing.
But the way science works, and where I was at that moment was, I had the information, I could work in a silo for many, many months, carefully analyzing the information, slowly submitting the paper for publication, going through several back and forths, and finally when the paper is published, We may disclose information.
This is how the situation works currently.
Well, that wouldn&#39;t help at this point, would it?
We had friends on the front lines and for us it was clear that what we needed was help, a lot of help.
And so the first thing we did was, as soon as the sequence came out of the machines, we posted it online.
We spread it to the whole world and said, &quot;Help us.&quot;
Help came.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from all over the world, amazed to see the information out there and published.
Some of the world&#39;s greatest virus followers are suddenly part of our society.
We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communication, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to find ways to stop it.
There are so many ways we can be communities like this.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic began to spread globally, was arriving abroad to learn, to participate, to join.
Everyone wants to play a role.
The amount of human capabilities out there was amazing, and the Internet brought us all together.
And you can imagine that instead of us being afraid of each other, that&#39;s all we said, &quot;Let&#39;s do this.&quot;
Let&#39;s work together and make this happen.&quot;
But the problem was that the information we all use, searching on the Internet, is too limited to do what we need to do.
Thus, many opportunities were lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the epidemic in Kenema, we had recorded 106 cases of patients, and again we did this openly for the world.
And in our labs, we&#39;ve been able to show that you can take the 106 records, we can train a computer to predict Ebola patients with almost 100% accuracy.
And we made an app that could disseminate this, to make this available to healthcare workers in the field.
But 106 is not enough to make this strong, to be proven.
So we are waiting for more information to be released.
That information has not yet come.
We are still waiting, maneuvering apart, in silos instead of working together.
And we just -- we can&#39;t accept this.
correct ? You, all of you, cannot accept this.
It&#39;s our life on the line.
And in fact, actually, we lost a lot of lives, a lot of health care workers, including dear colleagues of mine, five colleagues, Mbalo Vone, Alex Mog Boy, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Kovama and Mohamed Fula.
These are just five of the many healthcare workers in and around Kenema who died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and privately.
So, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight among ourselves, the virus thrives.
But not like other dangers to humanity, Ebola is the only one in which we are all similar.
We are all in this war together
Ebola is on someone&#39;s doorstep and it could soon be on our doorstep.
Therefore, in this place, with the same weaknesses, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we will work together joyfully.
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I discovered the word &quot;Kenema,&quot; the hospital we work in and the city we work in in Sierra Leone, named from the word Mende, meaning &quot;pure as a river, transparent and open to public view.&quot;
This was very profound for us, because without knowing this, we always felt that in honor of the people in Kenema where we were working, we had to work openly, we had to share and work together.
We should have done this.
We must all demand this for ourselves and for others - to be open to each other when another pandemic occurs, to fight this war together.
Because this is not the first Ebola epidemic and it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there waiting, such as the Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a million-dollar city, it could start there.
It could be something that travels through the air.
It could even be intentionally posted.
I know that this is scary. I understand this, but I also know, and this experience will show us, that we have the technology and we have the ability to succeed in this thing. Let us succeed in this and have the upper hand on viruses.
But we can only if we do it together and if we do it with fun.
This is for Dr. Khan and for all those who sacrificed their lives in the first ranks of this war, with us always, so that we may always be with them in the war.
And let us not let the world be defined by the devastation caused by a single virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you all .
