Well, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rebeczinsky.
She's a scientist in ancient fossils, which means she specializes in exhuming very old dead organisms.
Natalia Rebeczinsky: Yeah, there's someone calling me "Droit Doctor."
Latif Nasser: I think it's particularly interesting because of drilling places to look for these things, towards the highest Arctic circle in remote Canadian tundra.
On the day of the summer of 2006, it was at a drilling site called "the camel lair," which is located at less than 10 degrees of latitude away from the attractive North Pole.
Natalia: Really, it wouldn't look so exciting, because you spend the whole day walking with your backpack, GPS, notebook, and picking up anything that might seem fossilized.
At some location, I noticed something.
Natalia: Something rusty, sort of rusty, the size of my palm.
She was lying on the roof.
Latif Nasser: At first she thought it was just a fragment of wood, because such things were found in that place before -- parts of plants from prehistoric times.
But that night, on the way back to camp...
Natalia:...I took out the hand lens, checked it carefully and realized that it didn't carry tree rings.
Maybe something's been saved carefully, but it's really like...
Bones.
Latif Nasser: For the next four years, I went to the site over and over again, and eventually collected 30 fragments of the same bones, most of them really small.
Natalia: It's not a big group. She can have a little Zeplock bag.
Nasser Latif: I tried to put them together like the puzzle of the sliced images.
But it was a challenge.
Natalia: She was crushed into several small pieces, tried to use sand and paste, but it didn't look good.
Eventually, we used a 3D scanner.
LA: Oh! Natalia: Right?
LA: It turns out it's an easier way to do it on the assumption.
Natalia: It's kind of magic when it fits together.
How sure were you that you were doing it properly, that you collected it correctly?
Is there any possibility of bringing them together in another way and getting Baracket, for example?
Natalia: No. No, we got this.
Latif Nasser: What I got, I discovered, was a tibia, a legbone, and, specifically, belonging to a species of mammaid with a shadow, something like a cow or sheep.
But it couldn't have been one of them.
It was so big.
Natalia: This thing was huge, it was a big animal.
What kind of animal could it be?
She gave one of the shrapnel to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea about it.
Natalia: We took a saw, we made a hole in it, and it smelled interesting.
He smelled like burnt meat.
Natalia had a scent of skull cutting in the anatomy lab: collagen.
Colagen is what gives the structure to our bones.
Usually, after many years, it collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic was like a natural refrigerator and it preserved it.
But one or two years later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and I met a colleague named Mike Buckley who was explaining a new operation called "Colagen print."
It turns out that different species have slightly different cholesterol structures, if you get a cologne combination of unknown bones, you can compare them to known ones, and who knows, you might get a match.
So she sent one of them to him, Vedex.
Natalia: Yeah, you want to track it down. It's kind of important.
LA: He treated it, compared it to 37 known species of mammals in our time.
And he got a match.
It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone Natalia found from the upper Arctic was due to...
Beauty.
Natalia: And you come to me, what? This is amazing -- if it's true.
Latif Nasser: They examined all the fragments, and they got the same result.
However, based on the size of the bones discovered, this means that these sentences are 30 percent larger than the beauty of modern times.
This camel will be about 9 feet tall, and it weighs about half a ton.
Yeah,
Natalia found a giant camel from the Arctic.
Now, when you hear the word "glass," what comes to mind is one of these, the two-year-olds from the Middle East and Central Asia.
But the chances that the picture in your mind is one of these, the only toothless camels, the most fundamental desert creature -- is expanding in such hot sand places as the Middle East and Sahara, with an old large hunch to store water for long desert flights, with two big and broad feet to help them climb sand dunes.
How did one end up here in the upper Arctic?
Well, scientists have long known, as it turns out, even before Natalia was discovered, that beauty is actually of American origin.
They first showed up here.
For nearly 40 million years the beauty has been around, it can only be found in North America, about 20 different species, perhaps more.
Natalia: If you put it in a group, would it look different?
Yeah, you'll have different sizes.
Some of them will have a very long neck, so they actually look like a giraffe.
For some, it's a nose, like crocodiles.
Natalia: The primitive ones, they were already small, almost like rabbits.
What, a beauty the size of a rabbit?
Natalia: Old ones.
So maybe you won't be able to identify her.
LA: Oh, my God, I want a camel-bunny pet.
Natalia: I know, wouldn't that be great?
Latif Nasser: About three or seven million years ago, a group of camels headed towards South America, where it became Lama and Alpaca, and another group crossed the land bridge of Berenge towards Asia and Africa.
Then before the end of the last ice age, beauty was extinct in North America.
Scientists already knew all that, but it's still hard to explain how Natalia found one in the far north.
Low temperature, the pole is the opposite of the desert.
To be fair now, three and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, warmer than it is now.
It would be a northern forest, more like Yukon or Siberia today.
But yet, like, it's gonna be all winter six months where the water ponds freeze.
It could hit snowstorms.
The night extends for 24 consecutive hours.
Like, how's that... how?
How did one of the desert stars survive and live in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues thought they had the answer.
And it's kind of cool.
What if the advantages that we imagine make camels adapt in places like the desert, actually evolved to help them cope with winter?
What if he's not supposed to get on his broad feet with the sand, but snow, like ski boots?
What if that hump -- and it was a surprise to me, it didn't contain water, it contained fat -- was there to help the camels face the six winter months when the food was scarce?
And then, later, long after crossing the bridge, did you modify the winter features to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, the hump may be useful for beauty in hot climates because all fat is in one place, such as a fat backpack, which means it doesn't need all this insulation material in the rest of the body.
So it helps to waste the heat easier.
This is a crazy idea, it sounds like evidence that the perfect nature of the desert can be evidence of the ancient Arctic.
I'm not the right person to tell you this story.
Others said that it was a way of wondering about evolutionary biology or a future key to climate change.
But I love it for totally different reasons.
For me, this story revolves around us, about how we see the world and how it changes.
I've been trained as a historian.
And I knew that, in fact, a lot of historians too.
They made sense of the past.
They tell us the history of the universe and the planet we live in.
And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
Natalia: We make up stories and stick to them, like camels in the desert, right?
That's a great story!
Apparently, she lived there forever.
Nasser: But at any moment, some evidence can be discovered.
You can learn some little things that force you to rephrase everything you think you know.
Like, in this case, one scientist found one piece of what I thought was wood, and because of that, science has become a completely new theory that is completely against what this creature looks like the way it is.
And for me, it totally turned out the way I thought about sentences.
It turned out to be a fucking creature that only fits for one specific environment, to be a traveler in the world that happened to be in the desert, could end up almost anywhere.
I give you Azari.
Azari, hi. How are you?
Well, here, I got one of those for you.
Azuri enjoys a break from his usual inconvenience at Radio City Music Hall.
It's not just a joke.
Anyway -- but Azari exists among us as a vivid reminder that the story of our world is lively.
It requires preparation for control, and usually imagination.
Isn't that right, Azari?
And that we're just a small piece away from seeing the world in a new way.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how bad they are.
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
I would first like to return you to a cold night in the 2011 neighborhood that has had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting at a local bar outside Colomiba University, where I studied computer science and neuroscience, and I was with a fellow student in the middle of an interesting conversation about how chopped images could one day replace computers.
And while we were gonna get to the most interesting part of the talk, it turned on his phone, of course.
He pulled it towards him and looked at him and started printing.
And then he started to force his eyes to look at me and he said, "I complete my entire focus."
But of course his eyes were attached to the gasp, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone this time was with a group.
He was surfing pictures on Instagram, and those boys were hysterically laughing.
And this duality between feeling bad and feeling happy about the same technology has led me to think.
And every time I looked into it and realized that the negative factor in the equation wasn't digital information, it was simply the screen that separated me from my friend and combined those boys.
As you can see, they were gathered around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social recognition telling stories about the campfire.
And that's exactly the role of tools, I think.
Its role is to expand the capacity of our bodies.
And I think today's computers are doing the opposite.
Whether you're sending an e-mail to your wife, or you're making a musical or a friend's consolation, you're doing it almost the same way.
You're bending over those rectangles, pressing buttons and menus and more rectangles.
And it occurred to me that this is the wrong way, I think we could use a more natural machine.
We have to use machines to get our work back on the ground.
We have to use machines that use neuroscience principles to extend our senses rather than reduce them.
The circumstances wanted me to have such a machine with me.
It's called the Meta 2.
Let's try it.
I see the audience right in front of me, and I see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we're gonna see a spectroscopy, a very realistic spectrograph that appears in front of me, in front of my glasses that I'm wearing right now.
And that could be anything we shop for or learn from, and I could use my hands and move them very easily.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll be back in a moment.
Now, if you're like me, your mind must be resting on the possibilities of what this technology will allow us to do, to look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, so it's only natural that the first thing I imagined was to extend construction into a three-dimensional space instead of using these two-dimensional blueprints.
She touches the drawings at this moment and chooses internal decorator.
All of this was filmed on Gu Prue's camera through our own glasses.
This second use has my privacy, it's the professor's glass brain acting project, thanks to the University of California in San Francisco.
As a neural student, I always dream of being able to learn and memorize all these complex brain structures with a real machine that enables me to touch and manipulate different brain structures.
What you see is called enhanced reality, but for me it's related to a more complex story -- the story of how we can expand our body's capabilities with digital devices instead of doing the opposite.
Now...
I think in the next few years, humanity will go through some transformation.
We're gonna start putting a whole layer of digital information on the ground.
Imagine for a moment what this would mean to the novelists, to the painters, to the brain surgeons, to the interior decorators and perhaps to all present today.
And what I think we need to do as a community is try and do an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that expands from human experience, rather than making our reality as a game or a scattering of digital information in it.
And that's my passion.
I want to share a little secret with you.
Five years later -- this isn't the smallest device -- after almost five years, it's all gonna look like glass tapes on our eyes showing spectroscopic images.
And just as we don't care about any of the gears we buy -- we buy it because of the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of a mental operating system.
And it's important to do that the right way, because maybe we've lived inside these things at least our whole lives with the graphic interface of Windows.
And I don't know about you guys, but living in Windows is freaking me out.
To isolate the forehead from infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design principles rather than let a group of designers fight around it in the conference room.
And the principle we all want is called the "less resistant nervous path."
At every turn, we get between the mental operating system and our mind for the first time with our brain privacy.
In other words, we're trying to create an easy-to-use computer.
We build a system you've always known how to use.
These are the first three design principles that we employ in this new user experiment.
The first and most important principle is you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they require more effort from your brain to decipher them.
And it works against the less resistant nervous path.
While in fact enhanced you can, of course, put the TED platform's spectrogram here, and the spectrograph of your e-mail on this side of the office, your local memory has evolved in a way that allows you to find it.
You can put in the Tesla car that you want to buy -- or whatever my legal team asked me to put before the show.
Great. Your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
The second principle we call "touching for vision."
What do kids do when they see something that gets their attention?
They're trying to reach him and touch him.
And that's exactly how the natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system gets an essential boost from a sense we call a deep sense reception -- it's a sense of internal organs.
So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to be able to control it better, we're also going to understand it deeper.
And from it came the idea of "touching to see."
But it's not enough to try things ourselves.
We're social leaders.
Which leads me to the third principle, the campfire of our first story.
Our mirror neurons cell indicates that we can communicate better with each other and with our work if we can see each other's faces and hands in a three-dimensional way.
If you look at the video behind me, you see the users of a dead device playing with the same spectra, communicating with the eyes, and connecting around this thing, rather than distracting them with external devices.
Let's try this again, considering neuroscience.
So, our favorite operating system, our mental operating system.
Now I'm gonna step forward and take these glasses and leave them here next to the office.
I'm present with you at this moment, we're in touch.
You do my local memory, and I can take it and bring it to me, and you remind me that I'm the jam system.
And my deep sense of reception is working, and I can blow these glasses up into millions of pieces and touch the sensor that's wiping my handprint right now.
But seeing things alone isn't enough, in a second, my partner's gonna make a three-dimensional call--?
How's it going?
I can see it in three dimensions.
And it's very realistic.
Thank you.
This will replace the phones by the mirror neurons cell in the not-too-distant future.
How's it going?
Great. We're live.
, I give the audience the spectroscopic brain gift that we saw in the video earlier.
This will not only change the phones, but also the way we cooperate.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
:: This is the message that was discovered in that bar in 2011. The future of computers is not on one of these screens.
He's here, inside all of us.
If there's one idea I want to put to you, it's that the natural machine is not a fantasy of the future, it's here in 2016.
That's why all 100 people in Meta, including the management team, executives, designers and engineers -- and before TED2017, we're gonna throw our computer screens and replace them with a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thanks, everybody.
He showed me one thing, because he made a few presentations on the enhanced reality over the past year or so.
And there's a record among the tech experts, the subject of which... are we actually seeing something real on the screen?
There is a matter of vision, in a way that technology can show us a broader vision than you can see through glasses.
Was what we saw real?
Sure.
Not only that, but we took extra precautions to film it through the lenses with the Go Pro camera in the various footage we saw.
We want to simulate the real experience we see through the glasses, without any tricks.
: Thank you for showing us that. : I appreciate that, thank you very much.
I'm from the most liberal, tolerant, advanced spot in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great family of Seattle.
My mom was an artist, my dad was a college professor, and I'm really grateful to them for raising me, because I always felt so comfortable planning my life exactly the way it fits me.
As a matter of fact, I've taken a path other than the one my parents were planning.
When I was 19, I left college -- I left it, I got fired, say what you wanted.
Then I took a career course in playing the French trumpet that was my life's dream.
I played theatrical music all over America and Europe, and I wandered for a few years with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Bird.
At the end of my 20s, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a great life.
And, you know, my parents never complained.
They supported me through my path.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, on a break for a decade."
And -- and yet there was a hard conversation about my lifestyle that I wanted to tell you about.
I was 27, and I was coming home from Barcelona, and I visited my dad for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mom and we were alone in the kitchen.
She was quiet, very quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
I said, "What?" I mean, what is it, now?
I want you to be completely honest with me: were you voting for the Republicans?
Well, the truth is, I wasn't a politician, I was just a French horn player.
But I was fond of the discoveries, and they had revealed it, and it caused some confusion.
You see, I've been excited about capitalism, and I want to tell you why that was.
That seems to be my constant concern. Believe it or not, in poverty.
You see, when I was a kid, and I grew up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a sub-medium family, but of course that's not real poverty.
That's never close.
The first time I saw poverty, the face of poverty, when I was six or seven years old, was the early 1970s.
It was like many of you, an irregular example, a cliché.
It was a picture in the National Geographic Journal of a child of my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a bloated belly.
And he wouldn't have survived his inevitable destiny, I was aware of that, but I couldn't do anything.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that one, but any one like it.
It presented the West with the acute poverty that exists around the world.
Well, that vision followed me until I grew up, and I went to school, and I got out of school, and I went back to her and I started forming my family.
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?
Or people like him around the world?
And I started studying, although I wasn't in school, I was looking for the answer: what happened to the poorest people in the world?
Are they getting worse, are they getting better or what?
And I found the answer, and I've changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
As you can see -- most Americans think that poverty has become worse than it has been since we were children, since they saw that vision.
If you ask Americans, "Is poverty around the world worse or better?" 70% of people will answer that hunger has worsened since early 1970.
But that's the truth.
This is the discovery that changed my mind.
From 1970 to date, the proportion of the world &apos; s population living in hunger levels, living on a dollar or less a day, with, of course, the adjustment needed to calculate inflation, has fallen by 80 per cent.
There has been an 80% decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a child.
And I didn't even know that.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
That's something we should celebrate.
It is the greatest achievement against poverty in human history, and it has occurred in our lives.
And when I found out, I wondered what made it possible for us to do that, and how did it become possible?
If you don't know why, you won't be able to do it again.
If you want to do it again and get 2 billion people out of poverty, that's what we've been talking about since I was a kid, at least 2 billion of those, our brothers and sisters, have been pushed out of poverty.
I want two billion more, so I wanted to know why.
And I started looking for the answer.
And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from the left-right economists and the center.
And here we are.
These are the reasons.
That's five reasons to get 2 billion of our brothers and sisters out of poverty since I was a kid.
I. Globalization.
II. Free trade.
Third: Property rights.
IV. Rule of law.
V: Project creation.
It was because of the free economy system that spread worldwide after 1970.
Right now, I'm not naive.
I know that free institutions aren't perfect, I know that free enterprises aren't all we need to build a better world.
But that's great.
And beyond politics.
That's what I learned. That's what I found out.
Capitalism isn't just accumulation.
Because at its best, it's ambitious, and that's what a lot of people are talking about on this platform, the ambition that comes from dreams and is an integral part of the free economic system.
We must share it with more people.
Now, I want to share with you a second discovery, which is linked to the first one, which I believe will contribute to evolution not only around the world, but here at home.
The best saying I've ever heard to summarize the ideas I've just said about getting people out of poverty is: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
I've brought billions of people out of poverty."
Who said that?
Looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
This is wrong.
President Barack Obama said so.
Why would I know that by heart?
Because he told me that.
Crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah."
But more than that, I said, "What a chance."
You know what I was thinking?
That was during an event we were doing on this subject at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought, this is the solution to America's big problem today.
It revolves around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help people who need us most.
At present, I will not have to tell anyone in this Hall that we are in a crisis, in America and in many countries around the world, of political polarization.
It has risen to critical crisis levels.
That's unpleasant and not true.
There was an article last year in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious newspapers published in the West.
An article was published in 2014 on the incoherence of political action.
What is this? This is what psychiatrists call the phenomenon of assuming that your faith is based on love but your opponent's faith is based on hatred.
This is common in global conflict.
This is expected to be seen between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
What this book found was in America today, most Republicans and Democrats suffer from a symmetrical political movement.
The majority of people today who are politically active in our country believe that they are moving out of love while the other is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, "You know, my faith is based on compassion, I want to help people, but other people are evil and they're my watcher."
You can't evolve as a community when you're suffering from this kind of incoherence.
That's impossible.
How do we figure this out?
Well, first of all, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not underestimate the differences. That would be kind of naive.
There's a lot of good research on this.
One of my senior TED lecturers is my friend Jonathan Hydt.
He's a psychiatrist at NYU.
He's doing studies on faith, values and ethics for several people to figure out how they're different.
It has proved, for example, that conservatives and liberals have different importance in what they believe to be important.
For example: John Heidit has shown that liberals care 59 per cent more about poverty than about economic freedom.
Conservatives care 28 per cent more about economic freedom than about poverty.
Paradoxical differences, aren't they?
And we'll never agree. Wrong.
This is the diversity in which our strength lies.
You remember what brought the poor out of their poverty.
That obsession with poverty was linked to the way economic freedom spread around the world.
We need each other, or in other words, if we want to help people and bring two billion more people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Hmm.
How are we gonna do that?
It's confusing, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
Lots of it on this platform.
Creating social projects, yes. Of course. Special.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, ethical and responsible way.
But do you know what we really need?
We need a new day with a flexible ideology.
We should be less predictable.
Isn't it?
Do you feel that your faith is becoming predictable?
Kind of traditional?
Do you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that so dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, on the conservatives, you're always talking about taxes and laws and the big government.
On the left, the liberals, you talk about economics, it's always about income inequality.
These things are important now, very important to me, very important to you.
But when it comes to saving people who are starving and who need us, this will distract attention from them.
We need to unite together and agree on the best way to alleviate poverty using the best means at our disposal, which can be achieved when conservatives recognize their need for liberals and their obsession with poverty, the need for conservatives and their obsession with free trade.
This is the diversity where the future power of this country lies, if we choose it.
So how are we gonna do that, how are we gonna do that together?
I've got some rules of action, not just you, but me too.
First of all, first rule of business: remember, it's not good enough to tolerate those who disagree with you.
That's not good enough.
We must remember that we need different people with us, because there are people who need us all still waiting for these means.
Now, what are you gonna do, and how are you gonna say that?
Where does this start?
You know, we're all in this room now. Congratulations.
We are blessed with the people who hear us.
We are blessed with prosperity. We are blessed with leadership.
When others hear us, with this kind of unexpected ideology, people can listen.
Maybe we can move towards that point.
That's number one. Number two.
Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking myself to be that person who's crossing the barriers, the mysterious person, who's hard to classify.
If you're a conservative, you're the conservative person who always strives for poverty and moral duty to be a fighter of poverty.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets to deal with our problems when they are used responsibly.
If we do, we'll have two things.
First, we should start working on the next two billion and be the solution that we have seen so much in the past and need to see more of it in the future.
Secondly, we may be able to change the terrible sacred ideological war we are experiencing in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, maybe, just maybe, we'll realize that our biggest differences aren't really that different.
Thank you.
When I was in college, my specialty was in government business, which means I have to write a lot of paperwork, which means I'm gonna have to write a lot of paperwork.
Now, when a regular student writes a paper, his schedule almost looks like this...
As you can see, the work at first is slow, but you're done in the first week long enough to see the heavy days coming seem productive and nice.
And I wish I could do it the same way.
That's the plan.
I'm gonna start writing the schedule to get to work, and then the time comes to write and I end up like this.
And that happens in every piece of paper I write.
Until he asked me to write my 90-page graduation thesis, a paper we're supposed to be working on all year!
And for a paper like that, my usual schedule wasn't an option.
Because the project was too big.
I started planning the project, and I decided that the schedule should look something like this.
That's how it's gonna be.
I'm gonna start the easy and light work, and then I'm gonna put up a little bit of effort in the middle of the year, and at the end of the year, I'm gonna do my best... it's gonna be as easy as climbing the stairs, a degree.
How hard can climbing the stairs be?
It's no big deal, right?
But I got the funniest thing...
In the first months,
She came and went fast, and I couldn't do anything.
I decided to change my plan a little bit.
And then... but it actually went mid-year so fast, and I didn't write a single word, and now I'm here.
Two months down for one month, then two weeks.
And one day I woke up, and there were only three days left to deliver, and I didn't write a word yet, so I did the only thing I could do, and I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, and it lasted two whole days without sleep, and humans shouldn't be up for two days without sleep, and I ran to college, with the slow move, delivered the paper exactly on schedule.
I thought I'd done everything.
A week later, I got a call. It was a call from college.
They asked, "Are you Tim Orbin?"
And I said, "Yeah."
They said, "We need to talk to you about your thesis."
I said, "Okay."
And they said, "It's the best thesis we've ever seen."
That didn't actually happen.
It was a very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
No, no, it was so bad.
Anyway, today I'm an Internet writer and blogger.
I write in a blog called "Wait but why?"
Two years ago, I decided to write down the delay and delay.
And why did I postpone my deeds, so I wanted to explain to them and to the world, what was going on in the heads of those who were sent back, and why are we?
I had a theory that the brains of the predators really were different from the other people.
And to test this, I found a lab that allowed me to use an MRI to film my brain and another man's brain that didn't postpone his work so that I could compare them, and I didn't even know what to do.
And I brought the pictures with me to see for yourself today,
Now I want you to take a closer look and see if there's a difference.
I know you're not all experts, and it's not clear, but just look, okay?
So here's a picture of the undelayed brain,
Now...
Here's my brain image.
There's a difference.
Both brains contain, but the brain of the stereo also contains...
Now, what does that mean for the eclipse?
It means everything's fine until this happens.
Man: "This is the perfect time to do business." The monkey: "No!" if he's gonna do something useful and productive. But the monkey doesn't like the plan, and the monkey takes the wheel and says, "Why don't we read the whole Wikipedia page about Nancy and Tonya's scandal because I just remembered that this happened!
Then... then we'll go to the fridge and see if anything changes 10 minutes ago.
After that, we're going to enter the YouTube circuit that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about the magnet and ends up after a very long time watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
Monkey: "It's all gonna take time, and there's no room to do anything today.
Sorry!
Now, what's going on here?
This monkey doesn't look like someone you want behind the wheel.
He's living entirely at the moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, he only cares about two things: "Easy and fun."
In the animal world, this is going perfectly.
If you're a dog, and you've done nothing but easy and fun, you're a success by all accounts!
For monkeys, humans are just another kind of animal.
They eat, they sleep and they reproduce, which would be normal in primitive times.
But if you don't notice, we're not in those times.
We're in an advanced, civilized time, and the monkey doesn't know what that means.
And that's why it's in our head, which gives us powers that no other animal can do.
We can imagine the future.
We can see the whole picture.
And we can make long-term plans.
And the decision maker takes all this into account,
And he just wants us to do what seems right and logical now.
Sometimes doing something makes sense and fun at the same time, like attending dinner or going to sleep, or enjoying the time of the void.
That's why there's an overlap between logic and fun.
Sometimes they get along.
And at other times, it makes more sense to work at something that's hard and not fun for the greater good.
And that's where the conflict happens.
And for the record, this conflict always ends in the same way, making him spend most of his time in the orange area, a fun, easy area, and completely disconnected from the logic.
I call it.
Now, a place you're all well-known to.
A place where leisure activities take place at a time that isn't actually free time.
The fun you have in me isn't real fun, because it's totally unworthy, and the atmosphere around you is full of guilt, misery, anxiety, self-loathing, all the lovely feelings of the equators...
And the question when the monkey is behind the wheel is how to move itself into the blue zone, where things are less fun and easy, but they're much more important.
Well, it turns out that whoever's deferring his business has a guardian king, someone who's always watching him and looking at him in his darkest and darkest moments, someone called...
Now he's asleep most of the time, but he wakes up all of a sudden, when any deadline comes too close, or if there's a danger of embarrassing people, losing a job, or any scary consequence...
And most importantly, it's the only thing that scares the monkey.
Now, this monster has been connected to my life lately, because TED officials contacted me six months ago and let me talk about it.
Of course I said yes, it was always my dream to...
I speak at the TED Conference in the past.
And in the midst of all this enthusiasm, the decision maker was thinking of something else.
He was like, "Are we clear about what we agreed to just now?
Do we know what will happen someday in the future?
We need to sit down and get the speech ready right now."
The monkey said, " I fully agree with you, but how about we open Google maps and round the image to the bottom of India and explore it for two and a half hours until we reach the top of India, so that we may educate ourselves about this country. "
That is what we did that day.
Six months turned into four, then into two, and then into one month... the TED conference decided to announce the speakers at the conference.
When I opened the site, I found a picture of my face staring at me.
And guess who woke up?
He started losing his mind, and in a few seconds, the system turned into a mess.
And the monkey rose up -- remember, the monkey is afraid of the freak monster -- and ran up to the tree!
And finally, he could take the lead, and I could start working on the lecture.
Now it represents all kinds of crazy behavior at the probes, like how I've been able to spend two weeks, all kinds of behaviors on writing one sentence in my thesis, and then miraculously, words come continuously in two days to write eight pages.
This whole situation with the three characters, this is the system of the accountant.
Not beautiful, but in the end, it works.
And that's what I decided to write on the blog two years ago.
And when I wrote, I was fascinated by the answers,
Thousands of letters I've got, of all kinds of people, from all over the world, doing all kinds of jobs.
They were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and a lot of doctoral students, and they weren't gonna do it.
They all said the same thing: "I have the same problem."
What struck me was the contradiction between the lightness of the words that I wrote and the weight of these letters,
These people were writing with deep frustration about what the monkey did to them.
And when I thought about it, I said to myself, "If the delaying system is working, what happens?
Why are these people so frustrated?
Turns out there are two kinds of delays,
Everything I've talked about today, all the examples, all have a deadline.
And when there are deadlines, the effect of the postponement is contained and pressured in the short term to intervene.
But there's another kind of postponement, one that happens in circumstances that don't have a deadline.
For example, if you want to start a free business, something in art, or a pioneering business, these things don't have deadlines at first, because nothing happened at all, when if you go out and start working hard to gain some activity to do other things.
There's also a lot of important work outside of your work that doesn't include deadlines, such as visiting your parents or sports, caring for your health, working to develop your relationships, or breaking bad relationships.
Now, if the only way to end these difficult things is through, there is a problem, because in all these important works that do not contain the monster's deadlines, the beast will not appear.
So, the effect of the postponement isn't going to be contained, so this business will go on and on forever.
And that's the kind of long-term delay that's invisible and not much talked about, like the first type: fun, short-term and deadlines.
And people of the second type usually suffer quietly and privately.
And this delay could be a great source of grief and long-term regret.
I thought, "That's why these people are texting me, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
Not because they aim for a particular project,
It's because of that long-term delay that has made them lookers, sometimes, over their own lives.
Their frustration comes not from the failure to fulfill their dreams, but from the fact that they were not able to pursue them in the first place.
While I read the letters, I came up with some kind of inspiration:
That's right.
Of course, you may not be messy, like each other, and some of you may have a good relationship with the dates and stick to them, but remember, the secret monkey trick is when there's no deadline.
Now, I want to show you something at last.
My name is this:
Every square represents a week in 90 years.
There doesn't seem to be a lot of them, especially since we used a lot of them in the past.
I think we all need to take a deep look at this schedule.
And we have to think about what we're actually putting off, because each of us has something to do with his life.
We have to be careful about immediate pleasure monkeys,
This is a job for all of us.
And because there aren't so many boxes on the table, this is a job you have to start from today.
Um, maybe not "today," but...
You know,
Sometime soon...
Thanks.
We were there, souls and bodies packed in the church of Texas on the last night of our lives.
They're stacked in a room like this, but with wooden seats with annoying squeak covered with an obsolete red cloth, with Argen on my left and Coral on my back and a christening tub attached to the wall behind them.
A room like this, but...
With the same strong sense of thrill, the same deep hope of salvation, the same sweat in the palms of hands and the same people who don't listen in the back.
This was December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's second coming, and the end of the world as I know it.
That year, I was 12 years old, and I reached the age of accountability.
As soon as I stopped complaining about how unfair it was for Christ to return once again as soon as I became responsible for everything I had done, I decided that it would be better for me to solve my problems with the speed limit.
That's why I've been going to church for as long as I can.
Listen to the silence as eager as someone might listen to the noise, trying to make sure God didn't fool me and decided to come back early.
And in case he did, I had made a plan B, reading the "Left Behind" series, which was the last fashion yell of the time.
And I found in her pages that if I didn't get high at midnight, I had another try.
All I had to do was avoid being branded by the beast, fighting demons, the greedy enemies of Christ himself.
It's gonna be hard -- but I know I can do it.
Now the planning time is over.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We have ten minutes left, and my priest has invited us from the seats to the altar because he wanted to pray when it was midnight.
That's why every sect has taken its place.
The choir stayed on its platform, the diapers and their wives -- or the Baptist bourgeoises as I like to call them -- occupied the first place in front of the altar.
You see, in America, until Christ's second coming has a VIP section.
Behind the Baptist bourgeois were the elderly -- the young men and women whose backs were burned under the burning suns in cotton fields east of Texas, and whose skin appeared to be polished - because of the burning - in noble brown, just like the East Texas mud, and whose hopes and dreams of what life outside of East Texas might become even more so than their appearance.
Yeah, for me these guys and women were show stars.
They waited their whole lives for that moment, just as their ancestors from the Middle Ages to the end of the world, and just as my grandmother was waiting for Oprah Winfrey on Channel 8 every day at 4:00.
And just as I made her way to the altar, I snuck right behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother would definitely go to heaven.
And I thought if I held her hand during this prayer, I might go in the right direction with her.
That's why I stuck around and closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
And the prayers got louder.
The cries of response to the prayer call continue to rise even further.
The organ continued to add the funeral song.
And he came free to add sweat.
And I held my hand tighter, so I wouldn't be the one left behind.
And I closed my eyes so badly that I wouldn't see the dung being separated from the fat.
And then he sounded over us: "Amen."
It's over.
I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked at the older believers whose savior had not come, who were so proud that they seemed any more disappointed, who believed so strongly and so long that they now began to doubt.
But I was upset instead.
They've been tricked, scammed, misled, and I've got along with them all the time.
I prayed their prayers. I was as far away from all temptation as I could.
I dipped my head not once, but twice in the baptism pool that pushes into oblivion.
I believed.
Now what?
I got home just in time to turn on the TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium as it has gone around the world.
I figured it would be weird anyway that Jesus would come back again and again from different time zones.
And that made me feel ridiculous -- more hurt, really.
That night, I never stopped believing.
But I believed in something new: that you might not.
It's possible the answers I had were wrong, that the same questions were wrong.
Now, old as there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubt running towards its base, a promising spring of rivers.
I can track down all the drama in my life since that night in church when my savior didn't come; when it turns out that the thing I believed in was certain, if not a lie, is at least not the truth.
Although most of you have prepared for the new millennium in a completely different way, I am sure that you are here because part of you have done the same thing that I have done since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come.
I spread my hand, looking for something I believe in.
When I arrived at Yale University at the age of 18, I remained confident that my trip from Oak Leaf, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges I had, the shattered dreams, and the defeated bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself on one of my city's winter holidays lying on my face with my hands tied behind my back and the thief's gun pointed at my head, I understood that even the best education couldn't save me.
I stood by as an intern at Lehman Brothers Bank in 2008.
Hopefully -- I even called home to tell my family that we're not gonna be poor again.
But I witnessed the collapse of this temple of money in front of my eyes, and I understood that even the best job couldn't save me.
I stood by when I came to Washington as a young employee, heard a voice from Illinois calling, saying, "It's been a long time, but in this election, there's going to be a change in America."
But since Congress had stopped and the country had collapsed and hope and change seemed like a cruel joke, I understood that even a second political coming could not save me.
I have faithfully kneeled before the altar of the American dream, with success, money and power to the gods of my time.
But over and over again, it's midnight, and I open my eyes to find that all those gods are dead.
And from that cemetery, I started looking again, not because I was brave, but because I understood that I either believe or die.
That's why I went to the hajj, but to a place other than Mecca, Harvard Business School this time knowing that I would not be able to accept the redemption that was allegedly offered.
No, I knew there would be more work.
He started working from a dark spot at a crowded party, late at the beginning of the miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young people looking for something for a long time had asked him: What if we went on a car trip?
We didn't know where we could go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because, as Jack Kirok wrote all our lives, we yearn to sneak in at night and disappear somewhere, and go find out what people are doing all over the country.
So despite other voices saying that the risk was too high, and success was uncertain, we went anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we came 8,000 miles across America, between cow pastures in Montana, Detroit ruins, and New Orleans swamps, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses where the impact was the bottom line.
As we are trained at the Military Academy of Capitalism, we were surprised by that revolutionary idea.
This idea spread, and it turned into a non-profit organization called MIAS across America, that movement made me stand here on this podium.
It has spread because we have found great yearning for our generation to find purpose and meaning.
It spread because we found an infinite number of entrepreneurs in the dark corners of America who were creating jobs, changing lives and in need of a little help.
But to be honest, it spread because I fought to spread.
There were no limits that I could stand to preach this Bible, and to make more people believe that we can bandage the wounds of a broken state, one social project at a time.
But it was that missionary trip that led me to the very different Bible that I came to share with you today.
It started about a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York, at a Harvard Business School alumni.
Under the whole replica of a whale, I sat down with the giants of our time where they were celebrating their fellowship and good works.
There was a sense of pride where capital and assets under management exceeded half a trillion dollars.
We reviewed everything we did, and it was good.
But two days later, I had to travel north to Harlem, where I found myself sitting on an urban farm that was once an empty land, listening to a man named Tony telling me about the children who came there every day.
They all live below the poverty line.
Many carry all their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in the homeless shelter.
Some of them came to Tony's program, called developing Harlem, to get their only meal every day.
Tony told me he started developing Harlem from his retirement money, after he worked as a taxi driver for 20 years.
He told me he wasn't paying himself, because despite his success, the program still suffered from a lack of resources.
He told me he could take any help he could get.
I was there as such.
But once I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of tears falling out of my eyes.
I felt so inspired that one night I could sit in one room, with a few hundred people with half a trillion dollars, and two days later, in another room, 50 blocks north, where a man who didn't get paid to provide her only meal a day.
It wasn't the obvious inequality that made me cry, and it wasn't the idea of hunger, homeless children, it wasn't anger towards one percent or compassion about 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was a dialysis to a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story is on behalf of all those who are expected to solve their problems for themselves, even if they have nothing to do with it; my organization is on behalf of all those structural and systemic assistance that has never been delivered to Harlem, Apalachia or the lower 9th quarter; my voice is on behalf of all those sounds that look illiterate, dirty, and very unequipped.
And the shame of it, that shame has overwhelmed me like the shame of sitting in front of TV, watching Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium again and again.
I was deluded, misleadingly cheated.
But this time, I was the fake savior.
As you can see, I came a long way from that altar the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in vague language and saw suffering as an inevitable law of God, and they made a statement that it was a fact that did not accept error.
Yeah, I've gotten a lot better by going back to where I started.
Because it's simply not true to say that we live in the age of atheism -- no, we believe today just like ever before.
Some of us may be thinking of the prophecy of Brynnie Brown or Tony Robbins.
We may believe in New Yorker as a Bible or Bharvard Pissence Reveaux.
We may even feel deeper faith when we worship here at TED Church, but we really want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of attractive, influential leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as an inevitable law of capitalism. That is our God. We accept the text of technological progress as a fact that does not accept error.
We rarely realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one step, because we fear that it will undermine our entire institution.
But if you're confused by the unreasonable things that we have to accept, then that must be the time for accountability.
So I don't have the Bible of Troubles or Renewal or T.B.L.
Today I do not have the Bible of Faith to share with you.
In fact, what I have and what I'm offering is the Bible of Doubt.
The Bible of Doubt does not ask you to stop believing, but it asks you to believe in something new: that you may not believe.
It's possible that the answers we have are wrong that the questions themselves could be wrong,
Yeah, the Bible of Doubt means it's possible that we're on this stage, in this room, wrong.
Because it raises a question of why?
With all the power at our disposal, why do humans still suffer so much?
This suspicion led me to participate, putting our MPA across America out of business.
We've separated the staff, closed our doors, and we'll share our model free of charge with anyone who thinks he can do this without waiting for our approval.
This suspicion has forced me to abandon the sincere role that some have given me, because our time is too short and our chances are too far to wait for her to come second, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this suspicion feeds me and gives me hope that when we are overwhelmed by our problems, when our paths are revealed and they seem to lead us to our death, when our healers offer no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith -- it will be our humble suspicion that sheds some light on the darkness of our lives and our world and allows us to raise our voice to whisper.
Or let's just scream, or let's just say, "There has to be another way."
Thanks.
Food crisis.
News is on the news every day.
But what is it?
The lack of food in some regions of the world, or it could be too much...
In other regions, genetically modified foods save the world.
The modified food could be the problem?
The frequent dumping of waste into the sea creates bad oceans and toxic oceans, weakening nutrition.
And it never goes on like this.
And I think the current climate for this debate is terribly unconstructive.
How can we bring this closer to something that we can understand?
How is this apple a food crisis?
You all must have had an apple last week.
How old do you think this apple is from the moment it's been picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- which is the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the states.
And I don't expect the average to be so different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them up, we put them in cold tanks and then we fill the tanks with gas -- there's actually documented evidence of cases where workers have tried to get into these environments to retrieve an apple, and they died, because of the indoor air used to slow down the apple process that causes human poisoning.
How did none of you ever know about this?
Why didn't I know this before?
Ninety percent of the quality of that apple -- all the antioxidants -- is gone by the time we get it.
It's actually just a sugar ball.
How come we're so short of information and how can we get better?
I think what we're missing is a program.
I know software -- I know computers, they got me online when I was a kid.
I've done very strange things -- on this show.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a program, we could feel impulsive to ask, "What if?"
For me, I asked: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a climate map of the world.
Greener, less red-producing areas.
They exchange and change, and farmers from California are now Mexican farmers.
China takes land from the Braille to grow better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if every country has its own productive climate?
What's that gonna change the way we live?
What's that gonna change with the quality of life and food?
The problem with the previous generation was, we need more food and we need it to be cheap.
Welcome to your world farm.
We built a giant model of a farm.
All these footprints -- they're car tracks, planes, trains, wheels.
It's a miracle we're feeding 7 billion people with a few of us involved in food production.
What if...
We built a digital farm?
A world-class digital farm.
What if you could take this apple, figure it out somehow, send it through molecules in the air, and reassemble it at the other end?
What if?
I'll read with a stick of those words. They inspired me to do what I do.
One: "Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, no future." That's what I landed on the day I visited Minamisanki in southern Fukushima, after the disaster.
The kids went to Sandy and Tokyo. The land is contaminated, they import 70% of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Two percent of America's population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from two percent of the population of any country?
When we wander around the world, 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
80% don't want to be farmers.
Farming is hard.
The life of a miserable small-scale farmer.
They go into town.
In India: Farmers &apos; families are unable to access basic services. More than 10 farmers have committed suicide this year and the previous year.
It's uncomfortable to talk about it.
Where are they going?
To the city.
No, guys, everybody's headed there.
So how do we build this youth-inspired program?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my collection.
In the last few years, I went to Bath's and Byund's and Home Depot's and started to suck.
And I built small things and made the plants dance and connected them to my computer and killed them all -- a lot.
In the end, I made them survive.
And I made one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had, because I've been learning plant language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They say, "Do it, boy!
This is an unwanted old electronic room.
What can you do?"
My team and I built a farm inside the media lab, a place historically unknown to anything about biology, but with everything about virtual life.
Inside these 60 square feet we produced enough food to feed 300 people once a month -- not a lot of food.
And there's a lot of exciting technology out there.
But the most exciting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep greens and monthly harvests.
Is that the new cafeteria?
Is that the new retail experience?
Is this the new grocery store?
I can say one thing for sure: this is the first time a person in the media lab has removed the roots of anything.
We get power with bags; nothing's wrong with that.
But what happens when you have a therapist based on images, a data scientist, they take off roots and think, "Huh. I know something about -- I can do this, I want to try."
In this process, we're going to get the plants out and we're going to take some of them to the lab, because when you plant them and raise them, don't throw them away; they're kind of valuable to you.
I have this weird tongue right now, because I'm afraid to let anyone eat anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can find out about the lettuce acid up to ten.
I say, "No, this is 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat this day."
The lettuce that day was so sweet.
It was very sweet because the plant was exhausted and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!"
And the plant that won't die, it tastes sweet to me.
Technology slipped backwards in phytophysics.
So we thought other people needed to try this.
We wanted to see what people could make, imagine a lab we could ship anywhere.
Then we made it.
So at the interface of the medical lab comes my lab, which has 30 sensor points per plant.
If you know about genomes or genetics, that's the phenomenon, right?
The phenomenon.
When you say "I love strawberries from Mexico," you really like strawberries from the climate that produced the phrase you love.
So, if you're programming a climate -- so of carbon dioxide and so of oxygen that creates a recipe -- you program it for this plant, food for this plant, the size of this plant, its shape, its color, its sense.
We need data, so we put a bunch of allergies in there to show us what's going on.
If you think about your plants, and you look at them when you're so miserable because you say to him, "Why are you dying? You don't want to talk to me?"
Farmers have developed the most beautiful eyes for astrology when they're late 60 and 70 years old.
They can tell you when to see the plant die of nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency or need for more moisture.
These beautiful eyes don't pass on to the heirs.
These eyes are in the virtual cloud of farms.
We extend these data points over time.
We connect these data points to individual plants.
These are broccoli in my lab that day, via the IP address.
Our Brockley has an IP address.
If this isn't weird enough, you can press one and get a plant profile.
And this teaches you the evolution of downloadable plants, but not what you think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does he get to the food I need?
When does he get the taste I want?
Does he get too much water?
Does he get a lot of sun?
Warnings.
He can talk to me, he's a speaker, we have a language.
I think that's the first user on Facebook. Plants, right?
This information of this plant will begin with the addition of friends of God.
And I mean that -- it'll add friends from other plants that use less nitrogen or more phosphorous, less potassium.
We're gonna learn about complications that we're still guessing about right now.
And you might not agree with our friendship -- I don't know, you might agree to ask for our friendship, depending on our behavior.
Well, this is my lab.
It's a little bit better organized, and my experience comes from the design of hospital data centers for everything, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
So -- inside this environment, we run tests for all kinds of things, and we're going to be able to get to know each other.
And this process, aquaculture, was developed from the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water carried into space.
This process is based on giving the plant exactly what it needs: water, minerals and oxygen.
Roots aren't that complicated, so once you give it to her, you get this amazing expression.
And that's bad for plants to have two hearts.
And because he has two hearts, he grows four or five times faster.
It's a whole world.
We've gone away in technology and seed for a negative world and we're going to keep doing it, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is an integral world.
Well, we've planted all sorts of things.
These tomatoes haven't been commercially produced in 150 years.
Do you know we have stores for rare and old seeds?
Banks or seed banks.
Amazing.
She has living assets and things you've never eaten.
And I'm the only specialist in this room who ate that kind of tomato.
And the problem is, it was tomato paste. We don't know how to cook it, so we ate tomato paste and it wasn't so delicious.
We've done a lot with protein, we've raised all kinds of things.
We raised even humans, well, you might, but we didn't do it.
But what we confirmed was that the device was too big and too expensive.
And you started to distribute it around the world and it was worth about $100,000.
And to find someone with $100,000 in his back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted another little job.
And this project was actually one of my students -- a mechanical engineer named Camille.
And Camille and I and my team, we moved all summer, how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it work so that others could make it.
It was then distributed in schools between the seventh and eleventh grades.
And if you really want to humiliate, try to teach a child something.
And so I went to that school and I said, "Oh, hold it on 65% humidity."
One of the seventh graders said, "What's the humidity?"
And I said, "Hey, it's the water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot.
And I said, "Well, don't trust me.
Actually -- you don't trust me, do you?
Put it on 100.
So he put it on 100. So what happened?
He started condensing, making fog, and then he started diving.
And he said, "Oh, the moisture is the rain.
Why didn't you just tell me that?
We've set up a connection. That's a lot like the game.
They have a three-dimensional environment that they can enter from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or their little computers.
They have different parts of the means - natural, allergies.
They choose recipes created by other children anywhere in the world.
They pick the recipe, they play it, they plant a seed.
And as they grow, they make changes?
They say, "Why does a plant need carbon dioxide?
Isn't it bad?"
If we increase the gas, the plant dies.
And if we cut it down, the plant grows well.
I reap the plant, you've created a new digital recipe.
It's an interactive design and development and a process of exploration.
And then they can save that, and all the data about the new plant they developed or the new digital recipe and what did you do -- was it better or worse?
Imagine this as a small axle of operations.
We'll learn too much.
And this is one of the food computers, as we call it, in a school in three weeks.
This is three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it's the first time that this boy thinks of becoming a farmer -- or he's going to want to be a farmer.
That's why we opened all this up to the public.
It's online. Go home and try to build your first food computer.
It's gonna be hard -- that's what I'm telling you.
We're at first, but it's all there.
It's important for me to be easy to get in.
And we'll keep trying to make it easier.
These are farmers, electric engineers, mechanics, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, city planners.
They work on one basis what they do best.
But we've grown a little bit more.
This is my facility that I just started.
The warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose him.
And inside this warehouse, we'll build something like this.
It exists now.
Take a good look at her.
It does exist, too.
One raising vegetables, another raising a vaccine for Ebola's disease.
It's amazing that these plants and the winner of the Big Defense Research Agency Award are one of the reasons we're moving forward on Ebola.
Plants produce a protein resistant to Ebola disease.
So are pharmacists and food workers, down to lettuce.
But these two things aren't the same, and that's where I showed up with my field.
Everything's different.
We got the weird state of "everything good" and she's like, "This is my black box--" and "No, they bought my box."
"No, no, no -- I have very valuable intellectual property rights.
They bought my box, not his box."
And the truth is, we're still at the beginning, at a time when society is also moving.
When we order more cheap food, we don't order better environmentally friendly food.
And when McDonald announces what's in his chicken balls, the weirdest food of all time -- and they base their marketing plan on it -- everything changes.
Now let's get into the world.
Private diners, caterers, and food data centers operate on an open phenomenon.
Think of an open genetic map, but we're gonna put in small climate recipes, like the Wikipedia, that can dilate, turn on and develop.
What's that like in the world?
Remember the world is tied to strings?
We're starting to find lighthouses.
We started sending in information about food, instead of sending in food.
That's not my fantasy. That's what we're really spreading right now.
Food computers and food servers, and soon food data centres, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not a fight for what is bad.
We know what's bad about this.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and strengthening them with a rule to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.
There are times when I'm really ashamed to be European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, was pathetic.
There are a lot of contradictions,
We deeply mourned the tragic death of the two-year-old Kurdish child, and since then more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
We have international treaties that recognize refugees as a shared responsibility, but we accepted that small Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe.
We regret the existence of human smugglers, but we made it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a lack of employment, but we have excluded those people to whom our economic and demographic needs apply from coming to Europe.
We state the liberal values that we have in opposing fanatic Islam, but -- we have repressive policies that hinder asylum-seekers, differentiate between children and their families, and detain refugee property.
What do we do?
How has it come to this, by adopting this inhumane policy to confront this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think that's why people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
But I think it's because our politicians lack vision, a vision of how to build an international refugee system established more than 50 years ago for the changing and globalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step backwards and ask two fundamental questions, we all need to ask the two questions,
Question one, why isn't the current system working?
And secondly, what can we do to fix this system?
The modern refugee regime was established in the aftermath of the Second World War by these men.
Its primary objective is to ensure that when the State fails, or worse, to turn the system against its people, people find a place to go, to live in security and dignity so that they can return home.
I've been created specifically for situations such as the one we see in Syria today,
Through an international convention signed by 147 Governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and UNHCR, it has been determined that States must treat the people on their territory who flee conflict and persecution.
But today, this system failed.
In theory, refugees had the right to seek asylum.
But in practice, our immigration policies are based on cutting off the road to safety.
In theory, asylum has the right to be integrated into society, or to be returned to the country from which it came,
But in fact, their fate remains forever forgotten.
In theory, the refugee issue is a shared global responsibility.
But in practical terms, geography means that countries close to conflict take the vast majority of the world's refugees.
This system hasn't been broken because its rules are wrong.
We have not applied it sufficiently in this changing world, and that is what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
And how does the refugee system actually work?
But not from the top down from the institutional point of view, rather than from the refugee point of view.
So imagine a Syrian woman,
And let's call her a princess,
And a princess to me represents a lot of people I've met in the region.
A princess, representing about 25 percent of the world's refugees, a woman with children, can't go home because she came from this city you see in front of you, Homs, a city that was once beautiful and historic and now under ruins.
And so a princess can't go there.
Nor does it have any hope of resettlement in a third country, as it is available only as a lottery ticket to less than one percent of the world &apos; s refugees.
So a princess and her family are facing an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that a princess can take her family to camp,
But there are very few expectations in front of a princess and her family.
The camps are in dark, barren places, often in the desert.
At Zawtri camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of missiles at night across the border in Syria.
Economic activity is restricted.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around the world, about 80 per cent of refugees living in camps have to stay there for at least five years.
It's a miserable life, and maybe that's why, in fact, only nine percent of Syrians have resorted to this option.
Instead, a princess can go to urban areas to neighbouring cities, such as Amman or Beirut.
About 75 percent of Syrian refugees made this choice.
But there's, like, a lot of difficulty, too.
Refugees in these urban areas often do not have the right to work;
They don't usually have access to help.
Therefore, when a princess and her family used their basic savings, they were likely to face urban poverty.
So there's a third alternative for them, and that's why our refugee population has increased.
A princess can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous journey to another country, as we are witnessing in Europe today.
Around the world, we often face refugees who have no other choice than the three options of camp, poverty in neighbouring urban areas, or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this option is today &apos; s global refugee system.
But I think it's the wrong choice.
And that we can reconsider this choice.
The reason for reducing these options is because we believe that these are the only options available to refugees, and there are no other options.
Politicians framed the case as zero, so that if we take advantage of the refugees, we would charge citizens.
We tend to assume collectively that refugees are an inevitable cost or a burden on society.
But that's not necessarily and they can contribute to the community,
What I would like to say is that we can expand those options so that they benefit all: host States, communities, our own communities and refugees.
So I would like to suggest four ways in which we can change the way we think about the refugee issue.
All four of these methods have a common denominator: they are the same ways that we have come to globalization, mobility and markets, and to update the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first way I want to think about it is the idea of enabling environments, which begin with a fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, I initiated a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
We have chosen Uganda not because it is representative of all host countries.
It's not. It's because it's extraordinary.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is to give refugees economic opportunities,
She gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences are extraordinary for both refugees and host communities.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21 per cent of refugees own businesses that employ other people, and 40 per cent of these employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for nationals in the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional examples of thriving and vibrant leading companies,
For example, in a settlement called Nakival, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
We found Rwandans who run available businesses that allow young people to play computer games from recycled TVs and games, and they're going to be able to play games.
Unlike the restrictions imposed on them elsewhere, the refugees are inventing, and the man you see before you is a Congolese named Demo-Kay.
Demo-Kay arrived in this settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a director.
He started with a local radio station, with a group of friends and colleagues, rented a video camera, and now he's a filmmaker, and he's a filmmaker.
He made two documentary films with our team, and he succeeded in setting up a very little business.
These are the kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities that seek human prosperity.
Yeah, clothes, blankets, shelter and food are all important in the emergency phase, but we also have to look beyond that.
We need to provide access to communication and electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking services.
All the ways we take to reach the global economy can and must apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all the host countries of the world have practised the same ways that they have or have,
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still realistic alternative options that we can use.
Last April, I travelled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we had an idea while we were there with the international community and the Government, to provide employment opportunities for Syrians by supporting Jordan &apos; s national development strategy.
The idea is an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into work alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.
And just 15 minutes from Zawtri camp, there is home to 83,000 refugees, the current economic zone called King Hussein Bin Talal Development Centre.
The government has spent over $100 million to connect it to the electricity grid and roads, but it lacks two things: access to employment and domestic investment.
What if the refugees were able to work there, instead of being stuck in camps, they would be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria?
We realize that Jordan can benefit from this, and that its development strategy requires a paradigm shift and leap from a middle-income country to an industrialized country.
It can benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to the post-conflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the best source of eventual reconstruction of Syria.
We published the idea in Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah took this idea,
It was announced in London at the Syria Conference two weeks ago and will be implemented next summer.
The third idea I want to put in your hands is the harmonious preference between countries and refugees for happy results, as you see here in the personal photographs of Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but what I care to say is that we can do that and make everyone better.
Economist Alvin Roth developed the notion of homogeneous markets, in such ways that the order of preference of the parties is a final homogeneity.
My colleagues, Will Jones and Alex Tittleboy, have devised ways to apply that idea to refugees by asking refugees where they prefer but also allowing States to classify the types of refugees they wish to host based on skill or language criteria and to allow them to enter.
Now, of course, you need to build quotas like diversity and vulnerability, but it's the way to increase the potential for integration.
The idea of integration was successfully used, for example, by university students, college donors and patients, behind the algorithms on dating sites.
Why not apply the idea of giving refugees greater choices?
It can also be used at the national level, since one of the major challenges we face is to convince communities to accept refugees, and to make sure that they are able to do so.
At present, in my country, for example, we often send rural engineers and farmers to cities, which makes absolutely no sense.
The homogeneity of markets therefore provides a possible means of achieving those preferences together and of listening to the needs and demands of the displaced population and refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put in your hands is humanitarian visas.
A lot of the tragedies and chaos we saw in Europe could have been completely avoided.
It is based on the fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: in order to get asylum in Europe, you have to come spontaneously through those risky journeys that you have described.
But why should such dangerous journeys be necessary when we are in the era of economic airlines and the capabilities of modern embassies?
It's absolutely unnecessary journeys, and last year, more than 3,000 people died on Europe's borders and within European territory.
If refugees are simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we will avoid it, and there is a way to do so through something called a humanitarian visa, which allows people to obtain a visa at the embassy or consulate of a neighbouring country where they simply pay for their journey through ships or flights to Europe.
About 1,000 euros is the cost of smuggling a refugee from Turkey to the Greek Islands.
It costs 200 euros to fly economically from Podrum to Frankfurt.
If we allow the refugees to do this, it's gonna be very positive.
It will save lives and cut off the entire smuggling market and remove the chaos we see in the front line of Europe in areas such as the Greek Islands.
It's a policy that prevents us from doing this instead of solving rationally,
And this idea has been applied,
Brazil has relied on a pioneering method, since more than 2,000 Syrians have been able to obtain humanitarian visas, and when they enter Brazil, they get a description of a refugee.
Every Syrian has the status of a refugee and has been recognized as a real refugee.
And there's another historical precedent as well.
Between 1922 and 1942, these passports were used as travel documents to allow the transfer of 45,000 Armenians, Chechens and Turks to travel through Europe and obtain a refugee prescription elsewhere in Europe.
The International Office for Refugees received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
So all four ideas I've given you are a way through which we can expand princess' options,
They are ways in which we can make great choices for refugees away from the three basic impossible choices I have explained to you so that you can leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision of expanding refugee choices, but she realizes that they shouldn't be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yeah, it's a humanitarian issue and responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents and aspirations, and they have the ability to contribute... if we let them.
In the new world, migration is not on its way.
What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, and they will continue to be displaced from their homelands, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this... not based on the old logic of humanitarian assistance, not on the logic of charity, but on building up the opportunities offered by mobility and globalized markets, but on the need to be able to find a way to move on.
I assure you, we must wake up from our omission and urge politicians to wake up to face this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a little kid, I always dreamed of the ocean.
That wild place full of color and life was home to these fantasy alien beings.
I've filmed the big sharks that dominate the food chain and I've seen thin sea turtles dance around the coral reefs.
As a marine biologist I became a photographer, I spent most of my career looking for magical places like I dreamed of when I was a kid.
As you can see, I started to discover sea bodies at a relatively early age.
But the first time I dived deep into the water, I was 10 years old.
And I still remember very well when I was swimming fiercely to get to that old cannon of shallow coral reefs.
And when I finally got to him, I looked up, and the fish from everywhere surrounded me with all the colors of rainbows.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Bischak is a photographer of a 40-year-old conservation photographer on this planet, and I had the opportunity to discover some amazing seascapes of National Geographic and a founder who protected our seas.
I've filmed everything from the big sharks to the little ones that fit the comfort of my hand.
I inhaled the suspicious smell of humpback whales feeding a foot away from me in the cold seas of Canada by combing the rain forest of the great bear."
I was familiar with the mating ritual of the marine green turtles at the Mozambique Strait.
Everybody on this planet is affected by the ocean and affects it.
The ancient and clean seas I dreamed of as a child have become very difficult to find.
The seas have become more pressured and threatened.
As humans we still maintain our role as predators on Earth, I have witnessed and photographed many of these direct effects.
For a long time, I thought I'd hit my audience with their apathy through some annoying pictures.
Although this approach has advantages, I have returned to the beginning.
I believe the best way to change is to sell love.
I think I'm playing a sort of "talker" as a photographer, and I have a rare opportunity to detect animals and entire ecosystems that lie beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can't fall in love with something and become his hero if you don't know it exists.
By revealing this -- this is the graphic force of the department.
I've visited hundreds of marine sites, but only a few marine viewers have raised my attention and have had a profound impact.
The first time I tested that height was about 10 years ago, off the rough and wild coast of South Africa.
In June and July, massive swarms of sardines travel to the north in a mass exodus of what we call the sardines.
And those fish have a good reason to run.
They're chased by predators and elegant animals.
Dolphins hunt in a common way and can separate a swarm of sardines to create small and tempting fish populations.
You lure the fish to the ocean floor and then they rush to dinner to celebrate.
Sharks are believed to be behind it.
Now, most people believe that both sharks and dolphins are deadly enemies, but during the Sardine escape, they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to feed effectively.
Without the help of dolphins, eating balls are more common and sharks often end up eating so-called sardines, or with a mouth full of water.
Right now, having had some exciting moments with sharks during the Sardine escape, she knew she didn't see me as a figure.
However, I'm being slapped as any other guest during this very loud feast.
From the shores of Africa, let us travel to the east, where the vast Indian Ocean is to the Maldives, an archipelago of the atolls.
During the south-western monsoon storm, sea demon fish travel through the archipelago to a small spot in Ba Atul called Habero.
Large groups of crustaceans, the size of which is not more than the eye hole, are the basic food for sea demon fish.
When the amount of algae plants becomes small, the sea demon fish feed alone and flip many times around themselves, like a little puppy chasing its tail.
While, when the amount of algae plants rises, the sea demon fish line up behind each other to be a long food chain and if the first fish cannot eat food, of course the next fish will.
The lower the amount of algae in the Gulf, the closer the sea demonic fish get to each other, the more unique behavior called typhoon feeding.
As they hover in a narrow form, this group of sea demonic fish creates some kind of hurricane, absorbing algae and presenting it to their mouths.
The experience of diving among hundreds of sea demonic fish is truly unique and unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanifaro, this area was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with non-governmental organizations like Manta Trust, my photographs have certainly helped to make Hanifaro a protected area.
Currently, hunters from nearby islands once hunted sea demonic fish to make traditional drums from the skin of these fish.
Today, they're one of the most enthusiastic conservatives and the Maldivian economy earns more than $8 million each year.
I've always wanted to go back in time in an era where maps were mostly empty or read, "There's a dragon."
Today, the closest I have ever visited is the remote islands of the western Indian Ocean.
Far from sea lanes and fishing fleets, diving in these waters is an emotional reminder of what our oceans once were.
A few people heard about Bassas da India, a small speck of coral in the Mozambique Canal.
It is a coral reef that represents a protective outer barrier and the inner lake is the nursery of Galapagos sharks.
Those sharks were shy even during the day.
I had a feeling they'd be bolder and higher at night.
I've never faced many sharks on coral bumps.
Filming moments like this and sharing them with everyone -- reminds me of why I chose this path.
Sometime this year, I was on a mission to National Geographic in Baja California.
Around halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side is San Ignacio Lajón, a place for the birth of grey whales.
For 100 years, this coast has witnessed a massacre, with more than 20,000 grey whales killed, and only a few hundred survivors left.
Today the descendants of the same whales are pushing their little sons to the surface to play and even interact with us.
These species have really seen a remarkable return.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula is Kabu Belmo, a quiet fishing island.
Decades of random fishing have caused the collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to declare their waters as marine protected.
But then what happened was at least a miracle.
In 2005, after only one decade of protection, scientists measured fish recovery.
But don't hear a word from me -- come with me.
With only one breath, they dived with me deep, one of the largest places to be fish that I've ever faced.
We all have the ability to create some kind of hope.
And by filming me, I want to publish a message: it's not too late to protect our oceans.
And I want to focus especially on, the resilience and ease of nature by facing 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will look more and more for such images, and create images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
And I hope it becomes a daily event for me.
To prosper and survive in my profession, you really have to be optimistic and hopeless.
And to always work on the premise that the wonderful picture that will make a change is just so close, behind the next coral, inside the next lake or perhaps in the next lake.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was the basis of the national health policy in Zimbabwe.
After a long war of independence, the new Government immediately announced a socialist programme: health-care services and primary education were essentially free of charge.
Rural health centres have been spread widely, with nearly 80% of the population having access to these services in less than two hours on foot, a huge achievement of its kind.
In 1980, in independence, about 25% of children were vaccinated in Zimbabwe.
By 1990, just a decade later, this figure was 80%.
I felt so proud to be a part of this transformation, this revolution.
That sense of excitement and friendship was clear.
Working side by side with smart Zambian citizens -- scientists, doctors and activists -- I felt like belonging not only to the African Independence Movement, but also to the public health movement in progress.
But there were enormous challenges.
Zimbabwe announced the first case of AIDS in 1985, the year it was introduced.
I took care of a number of people with AIDS in early 1980, when I did medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what was in Africa's warehouse.
The infection rate rose by about 2% during the first days I was there.
This could rise for one out of four adults 17 years after she left Harari.
By mid-1990, she had learned of hundreds of people in a very small year who had been infected with HIV.
I've seen so many colleagues and friends die, my students and patients in hospitals, they die.
In response to these cases, I, along with my colleagues, set up a hospital.
We've multiple interventions to explain condom use.
We have made interventions in places of education and employment.
We did research, and we gave guidance to injured men's partners on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at that time I thought I was doing my best.
I was providing an excellent cure, just like it was.
But I wasn't talking about structural change.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke of his personal failure, which led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
In 10 years of genocide, he stated: "I thought I was doing my best, but after the genocide I realized that there were many things that could or should have been done to ring the alarm and join efforts to provide support."
The AIDS epidemic has killed the health of an unprepared society, and today the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that nearly 39 million people are dying of this disease. I am not the only one who feels sorry and sorry for not doing more earlier.
But while I was living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see myself as a champion or a politician.
I was there to improve my technical skills, my epidemiological research skills.
In my mind, my career lies in caring for patients and doing research to better understand the patterns of transmission among the population, and I was hoping to slow down the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially marginalized segments of the population were most at risk of HIV infection and death.
For sugar cane farming, which is much more like a feudal system than any modern institution, 60% of pregnant women have been registered with HIV.
She has worked to make it clear that the infection is not about moral decay but about the culture of male superiority, forced migrant labour and colonialism.
As health professionals, our tools were very limited: we used to invite people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms and reduce the number of partners.
The infection rates increased, and when treatment became available in the West, the treatment that is still our most powerful weapon against this virus, was not available to the public sector in Africa.
I did not mention the unequal access to these life-saving medicines or implicit economic and political systems that have caused infection rates among the population.
Scotty justified me by reminding myself that I was only a guest in this country, and that ringing the alarm could get me fired, preventing me from doing good work, caring for my patients, and doing the research I needed most.
I did not speak of the Government &apos; s early position on AIDS.
I didn't express my fears loud enough.
Some doctors and health professionals will think I didn't do anything wrong.
Our agreement with our patients, the department of earrings and his derivatives, is about the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.
And I've done everything I could for every patient.
I knew, however, that epidemics were manifest in the extent of the divisions that existed in our society, which reflected not only biology but, more importantly, patterns of marginalization and exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, social classes and others.
That's true for AIDS.
And that was recently true in the case of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who studied AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because abuses are embedded in economic and political organization in our social world, often in invisible ways for privileged and powerful people, and since violence is a reflection -- premature deaths, suffering and disease -- is a kind of violence.
We do little to our patients if we fail to regulate these social inequalities.
The ringing of the alarm is the first stage of spreading the right to public health, the way to combine support efforts to get out of this situation and bring about some change.
So these days, I won't be quiet anymore.
I'll talk about a lot of things, even if the audience doesn't feel comfortable, even if I don't feel comfortable either.
And a lot of my talk will be about ethnic and racial differences in institutions, things that are never supposed to exist in this country, absolutely not in the practice of medicine or public health.
But it exists, and we pay them to finish our lives ahead of time.
That is why the alarm bell should be ringed about the impact of racism on health in the United States of America, the ongoing violence between individuals and within institutions and people with black skin, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of application of the laws of Jim Crow and 60 years of troubled equality, and the ringing of the alarm bell on this is fundamental and central to my proper work as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature death -- in the sense of dying before 65 years of age -- is 50% higher for blacks than for whites.
A woman with black skin in 2012 was at risk of dying more than 10 times at birth compared to a woman with white skin.
Although we have made tremendous strides in reducing infant mortality, black infants face nearly three times the risk of death in their first year compared to white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics correspond to other statistics throughout the United States.
A recent analysis in The New York Times has shown that 1.5 million black people are missing.
They pointed out that more than one in six black men who were supposed to be between 25 and 45 years of age had been lost and disappeared from everyday life and had entered prison or died prematurely.
This is a major inequality in the daily and inappropriate acts of violence faced by young black people, and recent protests have been centred around the slogan "The life of the black-and-black-black" mission.
But we have to remember that constant and uneven ratios and the consequences of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes and AIDS -- are diseases that can lead to death slowly and in complete calm and may take so many black lives prematurely.
Since the Black-Skinn movement has spread, I am frustrated and angry that the medical community has opposed the use of the word "racial" in our research and studies.
You probably felt something every time I said that word.
Our medical students have protested the di-inz method in their white sweaters, but the medical community has negatively supported it since discrimination continues to affect the level of disease for people and deaths.
I am concerned about the trend of micro- and personal medicine, in search of biological or genetic targets for better treatments, which may inadvertently cause us to deviate from the overall picture of the subject, which is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves and, most importantly, determines the health of the population and, for many of us, "poor health."
As health professionals, in our day-to-day work, whether in hospital or in research, we witness the great inequality: the one who is unable to follow medical advice because he has other priorities, the transsexual youth who think of suicide because our society is so cruel, the single mother who must feel responsible for her son's poor health.
Our role as health professionals is not only to treat our patients but to ring the alarm and advocate for change.
Whether it's credible or not, our community position gives our voices great credibility, and it shouldn't be compromised.
I feel like I'm not talking in Zimbabwe, and I made a promise that as a health commissioner in New York City, I'm gonna take every chance I get to ring the alarm and combine efforts to support health equity.
I will speak against racism and hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak of discrimination on the basis of sex or any other form of equality.
It is time for us all to rise and speak out loud about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
Our patient's Easter, and our health all depends on it.
Well, by raising hands, how many of you have cancelled someone's Facebook friendship because he said something annoying about politics or religion, child protection or food?
And how many of you are trying to ignore at least one person because you simply don't want to talk to them.
You know, we just had to follow Henry Higgins' advice in Mayfair Lady:
But these days, with climate change and vaccine control, those subjects -- they're not safe either.
So this world we live in, this world where every conversation has the potential to turn into an argument, where politicians can't talk to each other and where even the slightest cases find someone who fights for or against them emotionally, it's not normal.
Pyo Research did a study on 10,000 adult Americans, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before in history.
It's unlikely we have a compromise, which means we don't listen to each other,
We make decisions about where we live, who we marry, even who we're friends with, depending on what we believe in.
Again, that means we don't listen to each other.
Conversation requires buzzing between speech and listening, and somewhere along the way, this conversation loses this balance.
Now, part of that goes back to technology.
Smartphones that are either in your hands or close enough that they can be accessed quickly.
According to the research of Pyo Resrich, about a third of Americans send over 100 messages a day.
Many of them, almost all of them, are more likely to exchange letters with their friends than to watch them face-to-face.
There's an excellent article in Atlantic magazine.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his children a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular subject without using observations.
And he said, "I realized..."
I realized that being able to talk is probably one of the most skill we've ever failed to teach.
Children spend hours every day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely have a chance to refine personal communication skills.
This question may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves, "Is there any skill in the 21st century more important than being able to maintain a consistent and confident conversation?"
Now, I'm talking directly to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of State, plumbers.
I talk to people I love. I talk to people I don't like.
I'm talking to some people with whom I disagree deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to make the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice in this regard, things like looking into a person's eye while speaking, thinking ahead of interesting subjects to discuss, looking and moving the head and smiling to show that you're speaking, repeating what you've just heard or summarizing that.
I want you to forget all that.
'Cause that's crap!
There's no reason for you to learn how to show attention if you're actually paying attention.
Now, I actually used the same skills in my professional interviews in normal life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to meet people, and it's actually going to help you learn how to be better engaged.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time and not boring, for God's sake, without harming anyone.
We've all had important previous conversations.
We've done it before, and we know what it looked like.
The kind of conversation that you're giving up and feeling inspired, or that you're feeling deeply connected or that you've been perfectly understood.
There's no reason why most of your relationships shouldn't be like hers.
So I have 10 basic rules that I'm going to explain to you, but honestly, if you just pick one of them and apply them, you're going to enjoy a great conversation.
Number one: do not perform multiple tasks.
And I don't mean here to leave your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean is, be clear.
Live the moment.
Don't think about the argument you had with your boss.
And don't think about what you're gonna eat for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half inside the conversation and half outside!
Tanya: Don't hold on to your mind.
If you want to ask your opinion without giving any opportunity to respond, discuss, increase and develop on your idea, write a blog.
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow critics to be on my program: because they're really boring.
If they were conservatives, you'd find them hating Obama and food stamps and abortion.
And if they were liberals, they'd hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
It's quite predictable.
And you don't want to be.
You need to enter every conversation assuming you have something you want to learn.
As the famous doctor therapist Scott Beck said, it requires proper listening to put the soul aside.
And that sometimes means canceling your personal opinion.
If we sense that acceptance, the speaker would be less vulnerable and more likely to open his own mind to the listener.
Again, let's say you want to learn something.
And as Bill Nye said, "Everybody you meet knows something you don't."
I put it this way: Everybody knows something.
Third: Use open questions.
In this case, the reference is journalists.
Start your questions with what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complicated question, you'll get an easy answer.
If I asked you, "Are you terrified?"
You will respond to the strongest word in the sentence, which is "awesome," and the answer will be "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
"Are you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let them describe it. It's those who know.
Try asking them questions like, "How was that?"
"How did that feel?"
Because then they might have to stand up and think about it, and so you'll get more fun answers.
Fourth, walk with the current.
That means that ideas will come to your mind and what you need is to make these ideas come out of your brain.
I've often heard interviews where guests speak for a few minutes and then the host comes back and asks a question that looks like it's coming out of nowhere or it's already answered.
This means that the host stopped listening for two minutes because he thought of this brilliant question, and he was determined to say it.
We do the same.
So we sit with someone we talk to, and suddenly we remember that day when we met Hog Jackman at the coffee shop.
And stop listening.
Stories and ideas that will come to your mind,
And you need to let these ideas go and come.
Fifth, if you don't know, say you don't know.
People on the radio, especially on stations like NPR, are much more aware that they're recording, so they're more careful about what they claim to be experts in and what they claim to be confident of.
Do it carefully.
Talking shouldn't be cheap.
Six, don't compare your experience with theirs.
If they're talking about losing a family member, don't you talk about the time you lost one of your family,
If they're talking about some of the problems they have at work, don't talk about how much you hate your work.
It's not the same, and it won't be.
Each experience can be taken on its own.
And more importantly, it's not about you.
You don't need to talk and try to show how amazing you are or how much you've suffered before.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking about his IQ, and he said, "I have no idea. Because people who brag about their IQ are losers."
Talks are not a promotional opportunity.
VII: Don't try to get yourself back.
Because it's kind of self-sacrifice and boredom, and we do it a lot.
Especially in business talks or in conversations with our children, we want to get to a certain point, so we're just rephrased over and over.
Don't do that.
VIII: Stay away from the weed.
And what I mean is, frankly, people don't care about years and names, dates, and all these details that you suffer to remember.
They don't care about that, and what they do care about is you.
They care what you like, what you have in common.
So, forget about the details and leave them.
Ninth: This is not the last point, but the most important one.
Listen up.
I may not be able to tell you how many people have told you that listening can be the most important skill at all that they can develop.
Buddha said, and I'm here to put it to you, if your mouth is open, you won't learn."
Calvin Coolidge said, "No one lost his job because of his excessive hearing."
So why don't we hear each other selling?
First of all, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am under control.
And I don't need to hear anything I'm not interested in.
And so I'm the focus of attention.
And I can enhance my identity.
But there is another reason: our attention is distracted.
A person on average speaks about 225 words a minute, but we can hear 500 words a minute.
So our minds are busy and full of 275 words like that.
I also know that it takes energy and effort to pay attention to someone, and if you can't do it, you don't actually talk.
You're just two people screaming and saying barely some sentences in the same place.
So we have to listen to each other.
Stephen Coffey said it beautifully.
He said: "Most of us do not listen with the intention of understanding.
But he only listens for the purpose of responding. "
Another rule is the tenth rule, which is short talk.
[A good conversation is like a short skirt. It's short enough to get a look, long enough to cover the rug -- my sister] all of this is the same basic concept, which is: be interested in others.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there were certain rituals in my house.
People were coming to talk to Grandpa and Grandma, and after they went, my mom would come to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?"
She was the bridesmaid of Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won the Pulitzer. He's a famous Russian ballerina."
So I grew up on this assumption that everyone has something special hidden from them.
And frankly, I think that's what made me the best hostess.
I'm trying as hard as I can to keep my mouth shut, my mind open, and I'm always ready to be amazing, and I've never been disappointed.
And you have to do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and, more importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
Thanks.
Hi.
I'm Matthew Williams. I'm a hero.
I won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, playing internationally in basketball and proudly represented Canada globally.
I practice five days a week on basketball and fast skiing, working with top-level trainers and mental performance consultants to be best at my sport.
By the way, it's all during the Special Olympics.
Does that change your idea of me and my accomplishments?
The world isn't like me to be heroes.
Not long ago, people like me were outcasts hiding out of sight.
There have been many changes since the launch of the Special Olympics in 1968, but in many cases people with intellectual disabilities are perceived as invisible to others everywhere.
People use offensive words in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
The word "late" or "late" is used in a degrading way.
They don't care how much pain my friends have.
I don't want you to think that being here is because I represent a humanitarian issue.
And I'm here because there's still a big problem with how people with intellectual disabilities are treated, or, more often than not, how they don't pay any attention to them.
Did you know he signed the World Games this year?
I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 viewers following the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSN and ESBN.
Do you know what happened?
What do you have in mind when you see someone like me?
I'm here today to challenge you to look at us in an equal way.
The Special Olympics change the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of followers.
For those who are not aware of it, the Special Olympics are intended for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Seat Olympics and the Olympics.
We offer high-quality sports tour programmes for persons with intellectual disabilities that can make changes in their lives and ideas.
This activity has changed my life and that of many.
It changed the way the world looks at those with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and mental disability.
As I got older, I played hockey up to the age of 12,
The older you get, the harder it feels to communicate with everyone, the more angry and frustrated you are.
I haven't had any sports for a while, I haven't had many friends and I felt abandoned and mourned.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hiding out of the community's sight.
They didn't think they could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the physical fitness of children with mental disabilities.
Through rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion that the lack of opportunity to participate has caused physical fitness.
There is much doubt about the extent to which persons with intellectual disabilities benefit from fitness programmes and opportunities behind sports competitions.
But the pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Schriffer, the founders of the Special Olympics, persevered and persevered, and their Olympic players proved themselves right more than four and a half million times.
Before I went to the Special Olympics, I was nervous, because I was young and shy and insecure and I didn't have a lot of friends.
When I got there, everyone was cheering, working on your support and letting you be yourself without any prior judgment.
Now I'm a basketball player and a skier who's been through several competitions at the regional and national levels, and this year he's been able to join the World Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first Canadian to join the basketball team and compete at the global games level.
I'm one of more than four and five hundred million athletes from all over the world, and I've heard many similar stories.
Being an athlete at the Special Olympics has allowed us to regain our self-esteem and dignity.
Special Olympics address critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than ordinary men and women with intellectual disabilities 20 years younger than those without disabilities.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by being vibrant and participating in sports.
Coaches taught us food and health rules.
Special Olympics also provide free health check-ups for athletes who have difficulty reaching out to a direct doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, I played with my Canadian team against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian basketball team underwent a special health examination of the world's athletes, where 7 out of 10 players received free headphones and were able to hear clearly for the first time.
The change they made was amazing.
They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach was able to communicate with them with words.
And their passions because they were able to hear the sound of basketball, the sound of whistles, and the cheerleaders in the bleachers -- that sounds like a Muslim and obvious thing.
Special Olympics don't only change athletes.
You also change their lives off the field.
This year, research has shown that almost half of the adults in the United States do not even know a person with a mental disability, and that 44% of Americans without personal contact with persons with intellectual disabilities are less acceptable and positive.
Then there are those offensive and degrading words that prove that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to many people.
People use it like they're just passing words or an insult.
I mentioned in tweeting more than nine million times last year, it was very painful for me and four and five hundred million athletes around the world.
It's not much of an insult, but it is.
As my sports colleague and global envoy John Franklin Stevens wrote in an open letter to the political critics who used it as an insult, " they joined us one day at the Special Olympics.
Let's see if you're leaving and nothing's changed inside of you."
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people stood in a long class for hours to attend the finals of the heavy lifting competition.
Everyone stood only when my fellow Jackie Barrett, the huge of Newfoundland, raised 655 pounds, and raised 611 pounds in squat position, recording a new record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder of all the athletes in Newfoundland - not only in your Olympics, but in the weight-bearing sport as a whole.
Jackie was a bright star in Los Angeles, and she was impressed with his performance.
Fifty years ago, a few thought that people with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 viewers filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Stadium to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games and to encourage athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hiding out of sight, we were getting encouraged and celebrated.
Special Olympics teach athletes confidence and pride.
The Special Olympics taught the world that people with special needs deserve respect and containment.
I now have my dreams and aspirations associated with this sport, good trainers, respect and dignity, good health, and a career as a personal trainer.
I'm no longer one of those who hides and gets bullied, and here I am, the oldest conversation at TED.
The world has become a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but the road is still long.
So the next time you meet a person with a mental disability, I hope you can see his abilities.
The next time someone uses those nasty words next to you, please tell him the pain you're leaving behind.
Please consider participating in the Special Olympics.
I'd like to continue with one last thought.
As Nelson Mandela said, "Sports have the potential to make a difference in the world."
The Special Olympics are changing the world by introducing changes in four and a half million athletes and allowing us to be confident, to identify friends, not to prejudge, to feel that sense and to be heroes.
Thank you very much.
You may not have heard before about Kenema, Sierra Leone or Urua, Nigeria.
But I know they're the most extraordinary places on Earth.
In hospitals there, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists quietly fighting one of the most deadly threats to humanity for years: the Lassa virus.
Lasa's virus looks a lot like Ebola.
It can cause intense fever and often it's fatal.
But these people, they put their lives at risk every day to protect people at their meetings, and so, they protect us all.
But one of the most unusual things I've learned about them in one of my first visits there in a few years has been that they start every morning -- these challenges, unusual days in the front row -- singing.
They come together, show their joy.
They show their souls.
And across the years, year after year when I visit them and they visit me, I meet with them and sing, and we write and love this, because that reminds us that we are not only here to pursue science together, we are connected through our common humanity.
And this is certainly, as you can imagine, becoming very important, and even fundamental, as something to start change.
This was not much in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This is the first epidemic in West Africa, along the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
That was scary, scary for all of us.
We were actually suspects for some time that Lasa and Ebola were spreading more than expected, and we said that someday Kenema could come.
So some members immediately came out of my team and joined Dr. Homar Khan and his team there, and we made a diagnosis to be able to get partial sensitivity tests to catch the Ebola if it comes across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We've already prepared these tests for the Lassa virus, we know how to do this, and the team was great.
We just had to give them the tools and the place to look for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On 23 May 2014, a woman entered the maternity section of the hospital, and the team conducted these important molecular tests and identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
That was extraordinary work done.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely and start a tracking call to find out what was going on.
I stopped something.
But by that day, the plague had broken out for months?
In hundreds of cases, he's already overtaken all the previous epidemics.
And I come to Sierra Leone not as an individual case, but as a big wave.
We had to work with the global community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema. Let's start facing those situations, where he brought in the next week 31, 92, and 147 -- all coming to Kenya, one of the only places in Sierra Leone to face this.
And we've worked around the clock trying to do as much as we can, trying to help these people, trying to get attention, but we've also done something else simple.
From that sample we took from the patient's blood to find Ebola, we can get him out, clearly.
The other thing we can do, in fact, is stop it chemically, put it in a box and send it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent him to Boston, where my team works.
And we worked around the clock splitting up on shifts, day by day, and we quickly produced 99 Ebola genomes.
This is the blueprint -- the viral genome is the blueprint.
We all have one.
He's saying everything inside of us, and he's saying too much information.
The result of such work is simple and powerful.
We can actually take these 99 different viruses, see them and compare them, and we can see, in fact, compared to three genes that happened earlier and spread out from Guinea, we can show the start of the outbreak in rich people months ago, once for humans, and then move from human to human.
Now, this is very important when you try to figure out how to interfere, but the important thing is to track down.
We can also see that the virus, as it moves between humans, mutates.
And every transformation of this is very important, because of the diagnosis, the vaccinations, the treatments that we use, it's all shown in this gene sequence, essentially -- that's what it leads.
And so global health experts have to respond, they have to evolve, to examine everything they've been doing.
But the way science works, and the place I was at that moment was, I had the information, I could work in a silo for a lot, a lot of months, carefully analyze the information, slow down the paper to be published, pass through several attempts back and forth, and finally, when the paper is published, we can disclose the information.
That's how it works right now.
Well, that wouldn't have helped at this point, would it?
We had friends in the front row, and for us it was clear that what we needed was help, a lot of help.
And so the first thing we did was, as soon as the sequence came out of the machines, we posted it online.
We spread it to the whole world and we said, "Help us."
Help came.
Before we knew her, we were being contacted from all over the world, impressed by seeing the information out there and its publication.
Some of the world's greatest virus followers have suddenly become part of our society.
We've been working together on this virtual road, sharing, regular calls, continuing to try to track the virus minutely, to find ways to stop it.
There are many ways in which we can be societies like these.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic began to spread globally, was reaching out to learn, to share, to blend in.
Everybody wants to play a role.
The amount of human capacity out there was wonderful, and the Internet brought us all together.
And you can imagine this instead of being scared of each other, that's all we said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together, let's make this happen."
But the problem was that the information we all use, online search, is too limited to do what we need to do.
Many opportunities were lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the epidemic in Kenema, we've recorded 106 patients, and once again we've done this publicly available to the world.
And in our labs, we've been able to show that you can take the 106 records, we can train the computer to predict and predict Ebola patients at about 100% accuracy.
And we made an app that could spread this, to make this available to health-care workers in the field.
But 106 isn't enough to make that strong, to be fixed.
So we're waiting for more information to be released.
That information has not yet come.
We're still waiting, maneuvering away, in the silos instead of working together.
And just -- we can't accept this.
You, all of you, can't accept this.
It's our life on the line.
And actually, we've lost a lot of lives, a lot of health care workers, including dear colleagues of me, five colleagues of Mpalo Voni, Alex Moj-Boy, Dr. Homar Khan, Alice Kovama and Mohamed Vola.
These are only five of the many health-care workers in and around Kenema who died while waiting for the world and while we all worked, quietly and in private.
So, Ebola, like all the dangers to humanity, it's a fire of mistrust, confusion and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight between us, the virus thrives.
But not as much as the other dangers to humanity, the Ebola is the only one in which we are all alike.
We're all in that war together.
Ebola on someone's threshold could soon become on our thresholds.
So in this place with the same weaknesses, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope we work together with joy.
My graduate student was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I discovered the word "Kenima," the hospital we work in and the city we work in Sierra Leone, named from Mindy means "pure like the river, transparent and open to public attention."
That was very deep for us, because without knowing this, we always felt it was a tribute to the people in Kenema, where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and work together.
We should have done this.
We all have to demand this for us and for others -- to be open to each other when there is another epidemic, to fight in this war together.
Because this isn't the first Ebola epidemic, and it won't be the last, and there's a lot of other microbes out there waiting, like the Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a million-dollar city, it could start there.
It could be something moving through the air.
Could even be intentionally published.
I know this is scary, but I also know, and this experiment is going to show us that we have the technology and we have the ability to succeed in this thing, to make it work and to be top-notch on viruses.
But we can only do it together and do it funny.
And that's for Dr. Khan and for all those who sacrificed their lives in the first rows of this war with us all the time, to be with them in the war all the time.
And let's not make the world known for the devastation caused by one virus, but it's lit with billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
