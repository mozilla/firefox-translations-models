Well, that's a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rebkinsky.
She is a scientist in ancient fossils, which means she specializes in excavating very ancient dead creatures.
Natalia Rebeckinsky: Yes, there are those who call me "Doctor of Dead Beings."
Latif Nasser: I think it’s particularly interesting because of the digging places to look for these things, towards the top of the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.
On the day of the summer of 2006, it was at a drilling site called the "camel shrine", which is located on less than 10 degrees of latitude away from the attractive Arctic.
Natalia: Really, it won’t seem very exciting, because you spend the entire day walking with your backpack, GPS, notebook and picking up anything that might look fossilized.
Nice Nasser: And at a location, I noticed something.
Natalia: Something rusty, sort of rust-colored, the size of my palm.
It was lying on the roof.
Nice Nasser: I initially thought it was just a shrapnel of wood, because such things were found in that place by-- parts plants from prehistoric times.
But that night, on the way back to the camp...
Natalia: ... I took out the lens of the hand, carefully checked it and realized that it didn't carry traces of tree rings.
Maybe something has been carefully memorized, but it really resembles...
The bones.
Latif Nasser: Over the next four years, I went to the site over and over again, eventually collecting 30 splinters of the same bones, most of which are really small.
Natalia: It's not a big group. She can fit the little bag of Zeblock.
Nasser Latif: And I tried to collect it together like a puzzle of cut images.
But it was a challenge.
Natalia: It was smashed into several small pieces, I tried to use sand and putty, but it doesn’t look good.
Eventually, we used a 3D scanner.
Nice Nasser: Oh! Natalia: Right?
Latif Nasser: It turns out that doing this hypothetically is the easiest way.
Natalia: It's kind of magic when it fits together.
How sure were you doing this properly, that you collected it properly?
Is there a possibility to bring it together in another way and get a baracite, for example?
Natalia: No. No, we got this.
Latif Nasser: What I got, discovered, was a trachea, a leg bone, specifically, belonging to the family of mammals with an envelope, something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been one of them.
It was so big.
Natalia: The size of this thing was enormous, it was a large animal.
Nice Nasser: Which animal can it be?
She introduced one of the fragments to some of her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea of her.
Natalia: We took a saw, we made a hole in it, and it smelled interesting.
Latif Nasser: It smelled like burnt meat.
It was a smell that Natalia knew by cutting skulls in the anatomy laboratory: collagen.
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.
Usually, after many years, it collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic was like a natural refrigerator and it was preserved.
But a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she met a colleague named Mike Buckley who was explaining a new operation called the “collagen footprint.”
It turns out that different varieties have slightly different collagen structures, if you get a collagen composition of unknown bones, you can compare them with known varieties, and who knows, you may get a match.
So she sent one of them to him, FedEx.
Natalia: Yes, you want to track it. It's kind of important.
. Latif Nasser: He treated them, and compared them with 37 known species of mammals in our time.
And he got a match.
The 3.5 million-year-old bone found by Natalia from the Upper Arctic region was found to be...
A camel.
Natalia: And you came up to me, what? That's amazing -- if it's true.
Latif Nasser: They examined all the fragments, and they got the same result.
However, based on the size of the bones that have been discovered, this means that these sentences are 30 percent larger than the beauty found in modern times.
The length of this camel will be about 9 feet, and weighing about half a ton.
Yes,
Natalia found a giant camel from the Arctic.
Now, when you hear the word ‘camel’, what might come to mind is one of these, the two-trumped camel from the Middle East and Central Asia.
But the chances that the picture painted in your mind are one of those, the only camel of the humps, the intrinsic desert creature -- it expands in hot sandy places like the Middle East and the desert, on the back of a large old hunchback to store water for long desert trips, has two large and wide feet to help it climb the sand dunes.
How did one of them end up here in the Upper North Arctic?
Well, scientists have long known, as it turned out, even before Natalia was discovered, that beauty was actually of American descent.
They first appeared here.
For nearly 40 to 45 million years, camels have been around, can only be found in North America, about 20 different species, and perhaps more.
Natalia: If I put it in a group, will it look different?
Nice Nasser: Yes, you will have different sizes.
Some of them will have a very long neck, so they actually look like a giraffe.
Nice Nasser: For some of them nose, like crocodiles.
Natalia: The primitive ones, they were already small, almost like rabbits.
Nice Nasser: What? A bunny-sized beauty?
Natalia: The old ones.
So you won't be able to recognize her maybe.
Oh, my God, I want a camel-bush-peel pet.
Natalia: I know, wouldn’t that be great?
Latif Nasser: About three or seven million years ago, a group of camels headed towards South America, where Lama and Albaka became, and another group crossed the land bridge of Beringia towards Asia and Africa.
Then before the end of the last Ice Age, beauty in North America became extinct.
Scientists have already known all of this, but it’s still hard to explain how Natalia found one in the far north.
Low temperature, pole, desert opposite.
To be fair now, three and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, warmer than it is now.
They would have been northern forests, more like Yukon or Siberia today.
But nevertheless, like, the length of winter will be six months where the water ponds will freeze.
Snowstorms can strike.
The night extends for 24 hours in a row.
Like, how is that... How?
How did one of the desert stars survive and live in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues thought they had the answer.
And it's kind of cool.
Whether the features we envision make the camel adapt in places like the desert, actually evolved to help it cope with winter?
What if his wide feet are not supposed to set foot in the sand, but snow, like skate boots?
What if that hunchback -- and it was a surprise to me, it doesn't have water, it doesn't have our fat -- it's there to help the camel face the six winter months. When food is scarce?
And then, later, long after crossing the bridge, did you adjust the winter features to adapt to the hot desert environment?
For example, a cumus may be useful for beauty in hot climates because all fat is present in one place, such as a backpack of fat, which means that you don’t need all this insulating material in the rest of the body.
It helps to dissipate heat more easily.
This is a crazy idea, it seems like evidence that the ideal nature of the desert can be a sign of the ancient Arctic.
I'm not the one to tell you this story.
Others have said it is a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or a future key to climate change.
But I like it for completely different reasons.
For me, this story is about how we see the world and how it changes.
I received training as a histographer.
I knew that, in fact, many scientists also historians.
They made the past logical.
You tell us the history of the universe and the planet we live in.
As a historian, you start with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
Natalia: We make up stories and stick to them, like camels in the desert, right?
This is a great story! You're totally adapting to that.
And she obviously lived there forever.
Nasser: But at any moment, some evidence can be discovered.
You can learn some little things that force you to reframe everything you think you know.
Like, in this case, one scientist found one piece of what I thought was wood, and because of that, science had a completely new theory and completely contrary to what this creature looked like.
And for me, it totally overturned the way I think about sentences.
She turned from a silly creature suitable only for one specific environment, to be a traveler in the world that happened to be present in the desert, could end up almost anywhere.
I present to you, Azuri.
Azuri, hi. How are you?
Okay, here, I got one of those for you.
Azuri enjoys a break from his regular annoyance in the music hall of Radio City.
It's not just a joke.
Anyway -- but, Azuri is among us as a living reminder that the story of our world is lively.
It requires readiness to adjust, usually imagination.
Isn't that right, Azuri?
And that we're only a little piece away from seeing the world in a new way.
Thank you very much.
Today’s computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how bad they are.
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
I would first like to take you back to a cold night in the neighborhood of 2011 that had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting in a local bar outside the University of Colomiba. Where I studied computer science and neuroscience, I was with a fellow student in the midst of an interesting conversation about the ability of holods to replace computers one day.
And as we were going to get to the most interesting part of the conversation, it lit up, of course.
He pulled it towards him and looked at him and started printing.
And then he started forcing his eyes to look at me and he was like, "I'm gonna keep you focused."
But of course, his eyes were stuck to the treacher, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone. This time he was with a group.
He was browsing the photos on Instagram, and those kids were laughing hysterically.
This duality between my miserable feeling and their happiness around the same technology. You got me thinking.
The more I looked at it, the more I realized that the negative factor in the equation was not digital information, but simply the position of the screen that separated me from my friend and was combining those children.
As you can see, they were gathered around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social acquaintance tell stories about the campfire.
And that's exactly the role of tools, I think.
Their role lies in the extension of our bodies’ abilities.
And I think computers today are doing the opposite.
Whether you’re sending an email to your wife or you’re writing a musical or a friend, you’re doing it all almost the same way.
You bend over those rectangles, pressing buttons, menus, and more rectangles.
And it occurred to me that this was the wrong way, I think we could use a machine that was closer to nature.
We have to use machines that bring our work back to the ground.
We have to use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to stretch our sensations instead of shrinking them.
The circumstances willed that I have such a machine with me.
It's called the Meta 2.
Let's try it.
I see the crowd right in front of me, and I see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we're going to see a spectral picture, a very realistic, very spectral image that appears in front of me, in front of my glasses, this one that I'm wearing right now.
This can be anything we shop for or learn from, and I can use my hands and move them with ease.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll be back in a minute.
Now, if you're like me, you must have to be staggering with the possibilities of what this technology will allow us to do, to look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, so it's natural that the first thing I imagined was to construct a three-dimensional space instead of using these two-dimensional schemes.
It touches the drawings at the moment and chooses an internal decor.
All this was filmed on the Go Pro camera through our own glasses.
This second use has my own specificity, it is the project of the professor representing the glass brain, thanks to the University of California, San Francisco.
As a neuroscientist, I always dream of being able to learn and memorize all these complex brain structures with a real machine, which enables me to touch and manipulate the various brain structures.
What you see is called augmented reality, but for me it's related to a more complex story -- the story of how we can extend our body's capabilities with digital devices rather than doing the opposite.
Now...
I think in the next few years, humanity will go through a transformation.
We will begin to put a whole layer of digital information on the ground.
Imagine for a moment what this might mean for novelists, painters, brain surgeons, interior designers and perhaps for everyone present today.
And what I think we need to do as a community. It is to try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of making our reality as a game or a digital information scattering in it.
That's my passion.
I want to share a little secret.
After five years -- this is not the smallest of the devices -- after about five years, they'll all look like glass ribbons on our eyes showing the spectral images.
And just as we don't care what a tremisher we buy for utilities -- we buy it because of the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of running a mental operating system.
And it's important to do it the right way, because we've probably lived inside these things at least all our lives with the graphical interface of Windows.
And I don't know about you, but living inside Windows freaks me out.
To isolate the most famous facade from infinity, we use neuroscience to guide our design principles instead of leaving a group of designers fighting around in the meeting room.
And the principle we all aspire to is called the "less resistant neural pathway."
At every turn, we connect the mental operating system with our brain for the first time to the specifics of our brains.
We try to make an easy-to-use computer.
We're building a system that you've always figured out how to use.
These are the first three design principles that we employ in this new user experience.
The first and foremost principle is that you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract. And it requires your brain to make more effort to decipher it.
It works against the less resistant neural pathway.
While in augmented reality, of course, you can put the spectral image of the TED platform here, and the spectral image of your email on this side of the office, and your topical memory has evolved in a way that allows it to be found.
You can put on the Tesla model you want to buy -- or whatever my legal team asked me to put it before the show.
Great, your brain knows exactly how to retrieve it.
The second principle is called "touch for vision."
What do children do when they see something that gets their attention?
They're trying to reach him and touch him.
And that's exactly how a natural machine should work.
Turns out that the visual system gets a basic boost from a sense that we call the reception of deep sense -- it's the sense of internal organ perception.
So by touching our work directly, we will not only be able to control it better, but we will also understand it more deeply.
From it came the idea of "touch for vision."
But it's not enough to try things ourselves.
We are social primates.
Which brings me to the third principle, the hologram of the camp from our first story.
Our mirror neuron cell suggests that we can communicate better with each other and with our work if we can see each other’s faces and hands in three dimensions.
If you look at the video behind me, you see Meta users playing with the same spectral image, communicating with the eyes, and connected to this thing, instead of distracting them with external devices.
Let's try this again with neuroscience in mind.
So, our preferred operating system, the mental operating system.
I'm going to take a step forward and take these glasses and leave them here by the office.
I'm present with you at this moment, we're in touch.
My local memory does, and I can take it and bring it to me, and it reminds me that I'm the system of oppurity.
And my deep sense of reception is working, and I can blow these glasses into millions of pieces and touch the sensor that's now wiping my imprint.
But seeing things alone is not enough, after a second my partner will make a three-dimensional call--?
How's it going?
I can see it in front of me in three-dimensional.
And it's very realistic.
Thank you.
This will replace the huts by mirror neuron cell in the not too distant future.
How are things?
Great, we're on the direct.
:, give the audience the gift of the spectral brain that we saw in the video above.
This will not only change the hawths, but also the way we cooperate.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
You are welcome and amplitude.
This is the letter that was discovered in that bar in 2011. The future of computers is not present in one of these screens.
It's right here, inside of all of us.
If there’s one idea I want to put to you, it’s that a natural machine is not a fantasy of the future, it’s here in 2016.
That's why all the hundred people at Meta, including the management team, the executives, the designers and the engineers -- and before TED2017, we're going to throw away our computer screens and replace them with a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thanks, everybody.
Tell me one thing. Because I've made a few demos on augmented reality over the past year almost.
There is a debate among technologists. Does he really see something real on the screen?
There’s a question of the field of vision, in a way that technology sees us as a broader view than you can see across glasses.
Was what we saw real?
: Sure.
Not only that, but we took extra precautions to film it through the lenses with a GoPro camera in the various shots we saw.
We want to simulate the real-life experience that we see through the glasses, without any tricks.
Thank you for showing us that. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.
I'm one of the most liberal, tolerant, advanced spots in the United States, Seattle, and Washington.
I grew up in a great family from Seattle.
My mom was an artist. My father was a college professor. I’m really grateful to them for raising me, because I’ve always felt completely comfortable planning my life exactly as it suits me.
As a matter of fact, I've taken a path other than the one my father was planning.
When I was 19, I left college -- I left it, I got kicked out of it, say what you want.
Then I took a career as a professional in playing the French trumpet that was the dream of my life.
I played theater music all over America and Europe, and wandered around for a few years with the great jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd.
At the end of my 20s, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a great life.
And to learn, my parents never complained.
Support me along my course.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, in a break for a decade."
And -- and yet there was a difficult conversation about my lifestyle I'd like to tell you.
I was at 27, I was going home from Barcelona, and I visited my father for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mom and we were alone in the kitchen.
And it was quiet, very quiet.
There was something wrong.
I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
She said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
I said, "What?" I mean, what's the matter, now?
She replied, “I want you to be completely honest with me: were you voting for the Republicans?”
Well, the truth is, I wasn't a politician, I was just a French trumper.
But I was fond of the discoveries, and they had revealed it, and it was caused by some confusion.
You see, I was passionate about capitalism, I want to tell you why it was.
It seems that it is my constant concern whether or not they believe it, in poverty.
As you can see, when I was young, and I grew up in Seattle, I remember the first time, I saw real poverty.
We were a sub-middle-class family, but that, of course, is not real poverty.
This is never close.
The first time I saw poverty, the face of poverty, when I was six or seven, in the early 1970s.
And it was like many of you, an irregular, tacky example.
It was a photo in the National Geographical Journal of a child I was in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a puffy belly.
And he wouldn't have survived his definite fate, I was aware of that but I couldn't do anything.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, but any image like it.
I gave the West the acute poverty that exists around the world.
Well, that vision followed me until I grew up and went to school and got out of school and went back to it and started to make my family.
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?
Or for people like him who are around the world?
And I started school, even though I wasn't in school, I was looking for the answer: What happened to the poorest people in the world?
Are they getting worse, better, or what?
I found the answer, and I changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
You see -- most Americans think that poverty has gotten worse than it has been since we were children, since they've seen that vision.
If you ask Americans, “Has poverty around the world gotten worse or better?” 70% of people will answer that hunger has worsened since early 1970.
But that's the truth.
That's the discovery that changed my mind.
From 1970 until now, the proportion of the world’s population living in hunger levels, living on a dollar or less a day, of course, with the necessary adjustment to calculate inflation, this percentage has fallen by 80 percent.
There has been an 80% reduction in the world’s worst poverty since I was a child.
And I didn't even know that.
That, my friends, is a miracle.
That's something we should celebrate.
It is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in the history of humanity, and it has happened in our lives.
When I knew that, I wondered what enabled us to do it and how it became possible.
If you don’t know why, you won’t be able to do it again.
If I want to do it again and get two billion people out of poverty, that’s what we’ve been talking about since I was a child, at least two billion of these, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want two billion more so I wanted to know why.
I started looking for the answer.
It was not a political answer, because I didn’t care.
You know, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from left-wing, right-wing and center economists.
And here we are.
That's the reason.
These are 5 reasons to get 2 billion of our brothers and sisters out of poverty since I was a child.
First, globalization.
Second, free trade.
Third, property rights.
Fourth: The rule of law.
Fifth: Creating projects.
This was due to the free economy system that spread around the world after 1970.
Right now, I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprises are not perfect, I know that free enterprises are not all we need to build a better world.
But that's great.
And beyond politics.
That's what I learned. That's what I found out.
Capitalism is not just accumulation.
Because at its best, it is ambitious, which is what many people are talking about above this platform, the ambition that comes from dreams and is an integral part of the free economy system.
We have to share it with more people.
Now, I want to share with you a second discovery, which is linked to the first discovery, which I believe will contribute to the development not only around the world, but here at home.
The best saying I have ever heard to summarize the ideas I’ve just told you about getting people out of poverty are: “Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
I’ve lifted billions of people out of poverty.”
Who said that?
Looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
That's wrong.
President Barack Obama said that.
Why do I know that by heart?
Because he told me that.
Mad.
And I said, "Haliluya."
But more than that, I said, "What a chance."
You know what I was thinking?
That was during an event we were doing about it at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought, that's the solution to the big problem that America is facing today. What?
These ideas are centered on liberals and conservatives, to help people who are desperately in need of us.
Right now, I won't have to tell anyone in this room that we're in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world about political polarization.
It has risen to critical crisis levels.
It's unpleasant, it's not true.
There has been an article last year in the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious newspapers published in the West.
An article published in 2014 on the inconsistency of political action.
This is what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your faith is based on love, but the doctrine of your opponent is based on hatred.
This is common in the global conflict.
This is expected to be seen between the Palestinians and the Israelis, for example.
What this article has found in America today, most Republicans and Democrats suffer from a disproportionate political movement.
The majority of people today are politically active in our country who believe that they are moving out of love while the motive of the other side is hatred.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, "As you know, my faith is based on empathy, I want to help people, but other people are evil and they're my watch."
You can't develop as a society when you're experiencing this kind of asymmetry.
That's impossible.
How do we figure this out?
Well, first of all, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let us not underestimate the differences. That would be kind of naive.
There is a lot of good research on this.
One of the TED lecturers is my friend Jonathan Hydet.
He is a psychologist at New York University.
He conducts studies on the faith, values, and ethics of several people to discover how they differ.
For example, it has been shown that conservatives and liberals have different importance in what they believe is important.
For example, John Heidett has proven that liberals care 59 percent more about poverty than they do about economic freedom.
Conservatives care about economic freedom at 28 percent more than poverty.
Contradictory differences, right?
We will never agree. Wrong.
This is the diversity in which our strength lies.
Remember what brought the poor out of their poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty, linked to the mode of economic freedom that spread around the world.
We need each other, or in other words, if we want to help people and get two billion other people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Hmm.
How are we gonna do that?
It's a confusing thing, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
A lot of it on this platform.
Creating social projects, yes. Of course. distinct.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, ethical and responsible way. Yeah. Yeah.
But do you really know what we need?
We need a new day with a flexible ideology.
We should be less predictable.
Isn't it?
Do you feel that your faith is beginning to become predictable?
Kind of traditional?
Do you feel like you’re always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economies, on the Lembans, conservatives, you always talk about taxes, laws and big government.
On the left, Liberalians, you’re talking about economies, it’s always about income inequality.
These things are important now, very important to me. Very important for you.
But when it comes to saving people who are starving and need us, these will distract attention from them.
We need to unite together and agree on the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best means at our disposal, and this can be achieved when the conservatives recognize their need for liberals and their obsession with poverty, and the need of liberals for conservatives and their obsession with free trade.
This is the diversity where the future power of this country lies, if we choose it.
So how do we do it, how are we going to do it together?
I've got some business rules, not only for you, but also for me.
First. The first rule of action: Remember, it is not good enough to tolerate who disagrees with you.
That's not good enough.
We must remember that we need people who are different with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these means.
Now, what are you going to do and how are you going to express that?
Where does this start?
You know, all of us in this room are now blessed.
We are blessed with the people you hear.
We are blessed with well-being. We are blessed with leadership.
When others hear us, with this kind of unexpected ideology, people can listen.
Perhaps you can advance towards that point.
That's number one. Number two.
Number two: I ask you and I ask myself to be that person who crosses the barriers, the mysterious person, who is difficult to classify.
If you're a conservative, be that conservative person who always seeks poverty and moral duty to be a poverty-fighter.
If you’re a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets to address our problems when they’re used responsibly.
If we do that, we'll have two things.
First, we should start working on the next two billion and be the solution we have seen so much in the past and need to see more of it in the future. That's what it's gonna be.
Secondly, we may be able to change the terrible sacred ideological war that we are suffering in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, maybe, just maybe, we'll be aware that our biggest differences aren't really that different.
Thank you.
When I was in college... My specialty was in government work, which means I have to write a lot of papers.
Now when any ordinary student writes a paper, his schedule seems almost like this.
As you can see... Work at first is slow, but you get done during the first week enough to make you see the next heavy days look productive and nice.
And I wish I could do it the same way,
That's how the plan is.
I'll start writing the schedule to start working, and then it's time to write. And I end up like this!
This happens in every paper I write.
Until he asked me to write my 90-page graduation thesis, a paper we're supposed to be working on all year long!
And for a paper like this, my usual schedule was not an option.
Because the project was huge.
I started planning the project, and I decided that the schedule should look like something like this.
That's how the year goes.
I'll start the easy and light work, then I'll increase the effort a little bit in the middle of the year, and at the end of the year I'll work hard. It'll be as easy as the stairs, degree.
How hard can climbing stairs be?
It's not a big deal, is it?
But it happened to me the funnest thing.
In the first months,
She came and walked away quickly, and I couldn't do anything.
I decided to change my plan a little.
And then... But in fact, the middle of the year went by quickly, and I didn’t write a single word. I'm here now!
Two months to a month. Then to two weeks.
And one day I woke up, and only three days left to deliver!! And I haven't written a word yet, so I did the only thing I could do, I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, and I kept two full days without sleeping. And humans shouldn't stay up for two days without sleep, you ran to college, in slow motion I handed the paper exactly on time!
I thought I had done everything.
A week later, I got a call, it was a call from the university.
They asked, "Are you Tim Orbürn?"
And I said, "Yes."
They said, "We should talk to you about your thesis."
I said, "Okay."
They said... "It's the best thesis we've ever seen."
This didn't actually happen,
It was a bad treatise to the fullest.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought, "This guy's amazing!"
No, no, it was pretty bad.
Anyway, today I'm a writer and a blogger on the Internet.
I write in a blog called “Wait, but why?”
Two years ago, I decided to write down about procrastination and postponement.
My actions have always puzzled the unprofessed around me, and why I postpone my work, so I wanted to explain to them and to the world what is going on in the heads of those who quot and postpone their deeds, and why we are like this.
I had a theory that the minds of procrastinators are actually different from other people
And to test this, I found a lab that allowed me to use an MRI machine to scan my brain and the brain of another man who wouldn't delay his work so I could compare them.
And I brought the pictures with me to see today for yourself,
Now I want you to take a closer look to see if there's a difference.
I know you're not all experts, and it's not clear, but just look, okay?
So here's a brain image that doesn't delay,
And now...
Here's a picture of my brain.
There's a difference.
Both minds contain, but the profile mind also contains
Now, what does that mean for the proclamant?
It means that everything is fine until this happens.
Man: "This is the perfect time to get the job done" Monkey: "No!" If he does something useful and productive. But the monkey doesn’t like the plan, and the monkey takes the wheel and says, “Why don’t we read the entire Wikipedia page about the Nancy and Tonya scandal because I just remembered that this happened!
Then... Then we'll go to the fridge and see if anything changes in it 10 minutes ago.
After that, we’ll enter the YouTube vortex that starts with videos about Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends after a very long time watching interviews with Justin Bieber’s mother.
Monkey: “All of this will take time, and there is no room to do anything today.
"Sorry!"
Now, what's going on here?
This monkey doesn't seem like someone you want to lead behind the tide.
He lives completely in the present moment,
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future. He only cares about two things: "Easy and fun."
In the animal world, this is going perfectly.
If you are a dog, and you do nothing but easy and fun, you are successful by all accounts!
And for monkeys, humans are just another species of animal.
They eat, sleep and multiply. This will be normal in primitive times.
But, if you don't notice, we're not in those times.
We are in an advanced and civilized time and the monkey does not know the meaning of this.
And that's why there's in our head, which gives us abilities that no other animal can do,
We can imagine the future,
We can see the whole picture.
We can make long-term plans.
The decision-maker takes all this into account,
And he wants us to just do what seems right and logical to do now.
Sometimes doing something seems logical and fun at the same time, like having dinner or going to bed, or having fun at leisure.
That's why there's an overlap between logical and fun.
Sometimes they get along,
At other times, it makes more sense to work on something that is difficult and fun for the greater benefit.
And here comes the conflict.
And for the procrastinator, this conflict always ends in the same way, making him spend most of his time in the orange area, a fun, easy area that is completely separate from the logic circle.
I call it.
Now, a place you all know, you procrastinators.
A place where leisure activities occur in time is not actually a free time.
The fun you have in is not a real fun, because it is absolutely unworthy and the atmosphere around you is filled with guilt, unhappiness, anxiety and self-loathing, all the beautiful feelings of the procrastinators.
The question when the monkey is behind the wheel is: How does the procrastinator move himself to the blue zone, an area where things that are less fun and easier happen but are much more important?
Well, it turns out that the one who postpones his work has the property of a guard, someone who always watches him and looks at him in the darkest and darkest of his moments. Someone called
Now sleeping most of the time. But he suddenly wakes up, when any deadline is too close, or there's a risk of embarrassment in front of people, or losing a job, or any frightening consequence.
The most important thing is that it's the only thing that scares the monkey.
Now, this monster has been connected to my life lately, because TED conference officials contacted me six months ago and let me talk about it.
Of course I said: Yes, it was always my dream that
I speak at the TED conference in the past.
In the midst of all this enthusiasm, the decision-maker was thinking of something else.
He was like, "Are we clear about what we just agreed to?
Do we know what will happen someday in the future?
We have to sit down and prepare the speech right now.
The monkey said: I completely agree with you, but what do you say we open Google maps, and bring the picture closer to the bottom of India and explore it for two and a half hours until we reach the top of India, so that we can educate ourselves about this country.
That's what we did that day.
It turned 6 months into 4 and then to 2 and then to one month. The TED Conference decided to announce the speakers at the conference,
When I opened the site, I found a picture of my face staring at me.
And guess who woke up?
He began to lose his mind. In a few seconds, the system turned into a mess.
And the monkey got up, remember, the monkey was afraid of the monster of panic, and went up to the tree!
Finally, he was able to pick up the tide and I was able to start working on the lecture.
Now it represents all sorts of crazy behaviors of procrastinators, such as how I was able to spend two weeks all sorts of behaviors on writing one sentence in my thesis, and then miraculously, words come continuously in two days to write 8 pages!.
This whole situation with the three characters, this is the system of the proof.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write on the blog two years ago.
And when I wrote, I was amazed by the responses,
I've got thousands of letters, from all sorts of people, from all over the world, working all kinds of jobs.
They were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a lot of PhD students,
And they all said they wrote the same thing, "I have the same problem."
What surprised me was the contrast between the lightness of the words I wrote and the weight of these letters.
These people were writing with great frustration about what procrastination had done to them in their lives, about what this monkey had done for them.
And when I thought about it, I thought to myself, "If the procrastination system works, what's going on?"
Why are these people so frustrated?
Turns out there are two kinds of procrastination.
Everything you talked about today, all the examples, all have a deadline.
And when there are deadlines, the effect of the postponement is contained and compressed in the short term to intervene.
But there is another type of postponement, one that occurs in circumstances that do not have a deadline.
For example, if you want to start a free business, something in art, or a pioneering business... These works have no deadlines at first, because nothing has happened at all. If you go out and start working hard to gain some activity to do other work.
There are also a lot of important work outside of your work and do not include deadlines. Like visiting your parents or sports and taking care of your health, working to develop your relationships, or cutting off bad relationships.
Now, if the only way to end these difficult things is by, there's a problem, because in all these important works that don't have monster deadlines, it won't show up.
He doesn't have a date to wake up for. So, the effect of the postponement will not contain, and therefore, these works will last and extend forever.
This is the type of long-term procrastination that is not seen and speaks much about, such as the first type: fun, short-term and contains deadlines.
People of the second type usually suffer from calm and privacy.
This procrastination can be a great source of long-term sadness and regret.
I thought, ‘That’s why these people are texting me, and that’s why they’re in such a bad state.’
Not because they're aiming for a particular project,
It's because of that long-term delay that made them like spectators, sometimes, for their own lives.
Their frustration does not come from not achieving their dreams, but because they could not pursue them in the first place.
While I read the letters, I was inspired: I don’t think there is anyone who doesn’t postpone his work.
That's right, I think you're all procrastinators,
Of course, you may not be a mess. Just like some of us. Some of you may be on good terms with appointments and stick to them. But remember: the monkey’s secret trick is when there is no deadline.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call this:
Each square represents a week in the life of 90 years,
There doesn't seem to be a lot of them. Especially since we've used a lot of it before.
I think we all need to take a deep look at this table.
And we have to think about what we're really putting off, because each of us has something to put off in our lives.
We must remain wary of the instant pleasure monkey,
This is a job for all of us.
And because there aren't a lot of boxes in the table, this is a job you have to start from today.
Um, maybe not today, but...
You know,
Sometime soon...
Thanks.
We were there, spirits and overcrowded bodies in Texas Church on the last night of our lives.
They are stacked in a room like this, but with wooden seats with a loud squeak covered with a red-balled fabric, with Argan on my left, a choir from behind me and a basin basin fixed in the wall behind them.
A room like this, but...
With the same strong sense of suspense, the same deep hope of salvation, the same sweat in the palms of the hands and the same people who do not listen in the back.
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the second coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I know it.
That year I reached the age of twelve and reached the age of accountability.
Once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was for Christ to come back once I became responsible for everything I had done, I decided it was better for me to solve my own problems very quickly.
That's why I went to church as much as I could.
Listen to stillness in the same way that someone would listen to the uproar, trying to make sure that the Lord did not deceive me and decided to come back early.
If he did, I had prepared a plan B, reading the series "Leaving behind" which was the last fashion of the time.
And I found between her pages that if I didn't have an orgasm at midnight, I had another attempt.
All I had to do was avoid the beast branding me, fighting the devils, the obedience and the enemy of Christ Himself.
It's going to be hard -- but I know I can do it.
Now the planning time is over.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We have ten minutes left, and we have invited a priest from the seats to the altar because he wanted the prayer to be held when midnight.
That's why every communal faction has taken its place.
The choir stayed in his stage, deacons and their wives -- or the baptized bourgeois, as I like to call them -- they occupied the first place in front of the altar.
You see, in America, until the second coming of Christ, he has a VIP department.
Behind the baptized bourgeoisie were the elderly — the men and women whose young backs were burned under the scorching suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and their skin seemed polished – because of the burning – in noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams were tilted and their dreams were broken for what life outside of East Texas might become even more than their backs.
Yeah, for me, these men and women were the stars of the show.
They waited for their whole life for that moment, just as their medieval ancestors longed for the end of the world, just as my grandmother was waiting for Oprah Winfrey’s program on Channel Eight every day at four o’clock.
Just as she made her way to the altar, she snuck straight behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother would definitely go to heaven.
And I thought that if I stuck with her hand during this prayer, I might go with her in the right direction
That's why I held on and closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
The sound of prayers became louder.
The shouts of response to the prayer call continue to rise further.
The argan continued to add a funerary hymn.
And the free came to add sweat.
And my hand stuck tighter, so that I wouldn't be the one to leave in the open.
And I closed my eyes so hard that I wouldn't see the nausea separated from the fat.
Then a voice sounded above us: "Amen."
It's over.
I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked at the older believers whose Savior did not come, who were so proud that any emirate would seem to be disappointed, who had believed so hard for a long time that they would now begin to doubt.
But I was upset instead of them.
They've been tricked, deceived, misled, and I've been in tune with them all the time.
I prayed their prayers, I have moved away from every temptation as much as I can.
I dipped my head not once, but twice in a baptism pool that pushes to sway.
I believed.
Now what?
I arrived home in time to turn on TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium as it went around the world.
It turned out to be strange, however, that Christ would return again and again according to different time zones.
And that made me feel ridiculous -- hurt more, really.
That night, I didn't stop believing.
But I believed in something new: it is possible that you might not believe.
It is possible that the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Now, in the past, where there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubt jogging in the direction of its base, a promising spring with rivers.
I can trace all the drama in my life since that night in the church when my Savior did not come; when it became clear that the thing I believed in with certainty, if not a lie, is at least not the truth.
Although most of you have prepared for the new millennium in a completely different way, I am sure that you are here because part of you have done the same thing that you have done since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come.
I stretched out my hand, looking for something I believe in.
When Yale University arrived at the age of eighteen, I was confident that my trip to Oak Leaf, Texas, was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges I knew, the broken dreams, the defeated bodies I saw.
But when I found myself on one of the winter holidays in my city lying on the ground, with my hands tied behind my back and a robber's gun pointed at my head, I understood that even the best education could not save me
I held out when I came to the Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Full of hope -- I even called home to tell my family that we're never going back poor again.
But I saw this temple of money collapse in front of my eyes, I understood that even the best job could not save me.
I held out when I came to Washington as a young employee, and heard a voice from Illinois call, and he says, “It’s been a long time, but in this election, there will be a change in America.”
But since Congress has stopped and the state has collapsed and hope and change have seemed like a cruel joke, I understand that even the second political coming cannot save me.
I have sincerely kneeled before the altar of the American dream, praying to the gods of my time for success, money, and power.
But over and over again, it's midnight, and I open my eyes to find that all those gods are dead.
And from that cemetery, I started looking again, not because I was brave, but because I understood that I either believe or die.
That’s why I went to the pilgrimage but to a place other than Mecca, Harvard Business School, realizing this time that I couldn’t accept the salvation it was alleged to have been offered.
No, I knew there would be more work.
He started working from a dark spot at a packed party, late in the early winters of the wretched Cambridge when I and three friends asked a question that young people looking for something real for a long time had asked him: What if we went on a car trip?
We didn’t know where we could go or how to get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because, as Jack Kerok wrote all our lives, we've been dying to "sneak in at night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what people across the country are doing.
So even though there were other voices that said the risk was too big, and the success was uncertain, we went anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we covered 8,000 miles across America, between the cow pastures of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the New Orleans swamps, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small projects where the monument is the point
As we are trained at the Military Academy of Capitalism, we were surprised by this revolutionary idea.
This idea spread, and it turned into a non-profit organization called the MIAS through America, that movement made me stand here on this platform.
It spread because we found a great yearning for our generation to find a purpose and meaning.
It spread because we found an infinite number of entrepreneurs in the dark corners and corners of America who were creating jobs, changing lives, and needing a little help.
But to be honest, I spread out because I fought to spread.
There were no limits to which I could stand to preach this Gospel, and to make more people believe that we could heal the wounds of a broken state, one social project at a time.
But it was this missionary journey that led me to the completely different Gospel that I came to share with you today.
It started one night almost a year ago at the Natural History Museum in New York, at the Harvard Business School alumni ceremony.
Under a complete replica of a what, I sat with the giants of our time as they celebrated their fellowship and good deeds.
There was a sense of pride where capital and assets under management exceed half a trillion dollars.
We've reviewed everything we've done, and it's been good.
But two days later, I had to travel north towards Harlem, where I found myself sitting on an urban farm that was once empty land, listening to a man named Tony tell me about the children who come there every day.
They all live below the poverty line.
Many carry all their belongings in a backpack to avoid being lost in the homeless shelter.
Some came to Tony's program, called "Developing Harlem," to get their only meal every day.
Tony told me that Harlem Development started his retirement money, after working as a taxi driver for twenty years.
He told me that he doesn’t give himself a salary, because despite his success, the program is still under-resourced.
He told me he might take any help he could get.
And I was there as this help.
But as soon as I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of tears falling from my eyes.
That was inspired that one night I could sit in one room, with a few hundred who had half a trillion dollars, and two days later, in another room, 50 blocks north, where a man who was not paid to provide a child with her only meal a day
It was not the egregious inequality that made me cry, and it was not the idea of hunger, and homeless children, that were not angry at one percent or the pity of about 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was like a dialysis to a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I have realized that my story is on behalf of all those who are expected to solve their own problems even if they have nothing to help them; my organization is acting on all that structural and systemic assistance that has never reached Harlem, Appalachia or the lower ninth district; my voice is on behalf of all those voices that seem illiterate, dirty, and highly unprepared.
And the shame of that, that shame overwhelmed me like the shame of sitting in front of the TV, watching Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium again and again and again
I was deceived, deceived, misguided.
But this time, I was the false savior.
As you can see, I came a long way from that altar the night that I thought the world would end, from a world where people speak in vague language and see suffering as an inevitable divine law and have taken the text as an unspeakable truth.
Yeah, I've gotten so much better that I'm back where I started.
Because it's simply not true to say that we live in the age of atheism -- no, we believe today just like ever.
Some of us may be believed to be the prophecy of Brennet Brown or Tony Robbins.
We may be believers in the New Yorker as a Bible or Harvard Business Review.
Perhaps until we feel a deeper faith when we worship here in the TED church, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak in the language of attractive and influential leaders that promises to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as the inevitable law of capitalism that is our God, we accept the text of technological progress as an insecure fact.
We rarely realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one step, because we fear that will undermine our entire institution.
But if you’re confused by the unreasonable things we have to accept, it must be the time for accountability.
So I don't have the gospel of turbulence or renewal or TPL.
Today I do not have the Gospel of faith to share it with you.
In fact, what I have and what I present is the gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask you to stop believing, but to believe in something new: it is possible not to believe.
It's possible that the answers we have are wrong that it's possible that the questions themselves are wrong,
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we are on this stage, in this room, wrong.
Because it raises a question of why?
With all the ability at our fingertips, why are humans still suffering so badly?
This suspicion led me to participate, so we put our organization MPAS through America out of business.
We have fired our staff and closed our doors and will share our model for free with anyone who believes they can do this work without waiting for our approval.
This doubt has forced me to give up the role of the Savior entrusted to me by some, because our time is too short and our chances are too far to wait for her second coming, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it feeds me and gives me hope that when we are overwhelmed by our problems, when the paths unfold to us and seem to lead us to our death, when our healers do not offer any comfort to our wounds, our blind faith will not be -- it will be our humble doubt that sheds some light on the darkness of our lives and our world and allows us to raise our voices to the whispering
Or to scream or simply say, simply, “There has to be another way.”
Thanks.
food crisis.
News on the news every day.
But what is it?
Food shortages in some parts of the world or may be a lot.
In other regions, genetically modified food saves the world.
Could the modified food be the problem?
Too much dumping waste into the sea creates bad oceans and toxic oceans, and weakens nutrition.
And it never goes on like this.
I believe that the current climate for this debate is not terribly constructive.
How can we bring this closer to something we can understand?
How is this apple a food crisis?
You must all have had an apple last week.
How old do you think this apple is since the moment you pick it?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the hot states
I don’t expect the average to be very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold tanks and then we fill the tanks with gas -- there's actually documented evidence of cases where workers tried to get into these environments to retrieve an apple, and they died, because of the air inside used to slow down the apple process that causes poisoning in humans.
How come none of you ever knew about this?
Why didn't I know this before?
Ninety percent of the quality of those apples -- all the antioxidants -- are gone by the time we get them.
It's actually just a sugar ball.
How did we become so insecure and how can we get better?
I think what we're missing is a program.
I know software -- I know computers, I got online when I was young.
I did very strange things-- on this show.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a program, we could feel impulsive to ask: What if?
For me, I asked: What if the climate is democratic?
This is a climate map of the world.
The most productive areas are green, and the least produced in red.
They exchange and change, and farmers from California are now Mexican farmers.
China takes land from Braille to grow better food, and we are climate slaves.
What if each country has its own productive climate?
What would change that in the way we live?
What would change that with quality of life and food?
The problem with the previous generation was, we need more food and we need it to be cheap.
Welcome to your global farm.
We've built a giant model of a farm.
All these effects -- are the effects of cars, pirtines, trains and wheels.
It's a miracle that we feed 7 billion people with a few of us involved in food production.
What if...
We built a digital farm?
Global digital farm.
What if you could take this apple, number it somehow, send it through particles in the air, and reassemble it at the other end?
What if?
I'm going to read a few of these things. They inspired me to do what I do.
First, “Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, no future.” This is what I landed on the day I visited Minamisanrki in southern Fukushima, after the disaster.
The kids headed for Sanday and Tokyo. The land is contaminated, they import seventy percent of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Two percent of the U.S. population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer could come from two percent of a country’s population?
When we go around the world, 50% of the population of Africa is under the age of 18.
80% don’t want to become farmers.
Agriculture is hard.
The life of a small, miserable stockholder farmer.
They go into town.
In India, families of farmers are unable to access basic services, more farmers have committed suicide this year and the previous year than the previous ten.
It's uncomfortable to talk about this.
Where are they going?
To the city.
No guys, and everyone's headed there.
How do we build this program that inspires young people?
Welcome to the new agricultural tractor.
This is my assembly.
In previous years, I went to Bed Bath, Beyond, and Home Depot and started being a mess.
And I built trivial things and I got the plants dancing and I got them in my computer and killed them all -- a lot.
In the end, I made them survive.
And I made one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had, because I've been learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They say, "Do it, boy!
This is an old, unwanted electronic room.
What can you do?
My team and I built a farm inside the media lab, a place unknown throughout history to anything about biology, but all about virtual life.
Inside these 60 square feet we produced enough food to feed 300 people once a month -- not much food.
And there's a lot of exciting technology out there.
But the most exciting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors and monthly harvest.
Is this the new cafeteria?
Is this the new retail experience?
Is this the new grocery store?
I can say one thing for sure: this is the first time someone in the media lab has taken root for anything
We get power with bags; nothing is wrong with this.
But what happens when you have a photo-based processing expert, a data scientist, rooted out and thinking, "Huh. I know something about -- I can get this done, I want to try it."
In this process we will take the plants out and we will take some of them to the laboratory, because when you grow them and raise them, do not throw them away; they are rather precious to you.
I have this weird tongue now, because I'm afraid I'm gonna let anyone eat anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can know the lice acidity up to one ten.
I say, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat this day."
The lettuce that day was so sweet.
She was so sweet because the plant was exhausted and he created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect himself: "I will not die!"
And a plant that won't die, tastes sweet to me.
Technology has fallen backwards in plant physiology.
So we thought other people needed to try this.
We wanted to see what people could make, so we imagined a lab that we could ship anywhere.
Then we made it.
So in the front of the medical lab comes my lab, which has 30 sensor points per plant.
If you know about the genome or genetics, that's the phenomenon, right?
The phenomenon.
When you say "I love strawberries from Mexico," you really love strawberries from the climate that produced the phrase you like.
So, if you're programming a climate -- so is carbon dioxide and so is oxygen that creates a recipe -- you've programmed the phrase for this plant, the food for this plant, the size of this plant, its shape, its color, its texture.
We need data. So we put a bunch of sensors there to show us what's going on.
If you're thinking about your plants, and you look at them and you're so miserable because you're saying, "Why are you dying?
Farmers have developed the most beautiful eyes for astrology when they are in their late 60s and 70s.
They can tell you when you see the plant die from a lack of nitrogen, calcium deficiency or the need for more moisture.
These beautiful eyes don't move on with heirs.
These eyes are in the virtual cloud of the farmer.
We extend these data points over time.
We connect these data points to individual plants.
These are the broccoli in my lab that day, via the address of the Internet protocol.
Our Brookly has a IP address.
If that's not weird enough, you can hit one and get a profile of the plant,
And this teaches you about the evolution of a ventable plant, but not as you think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does it get to the food I need?
When does he achieve the taste I want?
Does it get too much water?
Does he get a lot of sun?
Warnings.
He can talk to me, he's a speaker, we have a language.
I think that's the first user on Facebook Plants, right?
This plant will begin to add friends to God.
And I mean that -- it'll add friends from other plants that use less nitrogen or more phosphorus, less potassium.
We'll learn about the complexities we're still guessing some of them now.
And you may not agree with our friendship -- I don't know, and you may agree to ask for our friendship, depending on our actions.
Well, this is my lab.
It's a little better organized, and my experience comes from designing hospital data centers for everything, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
So -- within this environment, we run tests of all sorts of things,
This process, hydroponics, was developed from the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water carried into space.
This process works on the basis of giving the plant exactly what it needs: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated, so once you give them that, you get that amazing expression.
And that's why the plant has two hearts.
Because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a whole world.
We've gone far in the way of technology and a seed of a negative world and we'll keep doing it, but we'll have a new tool, too, which is an integrated world.
Well, we've planted all sorts of things.
These tomatoes have not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that we have stores for rare and ancient seeds?
Banks or banks for seeds.
Something amazing.
It has living origins and things you've never eaten.
And I'm the only one in this room who's eaten this kind of tomato.
The problem was that it was a tomato paste that we didn’t know how to cook, so we ate tomato paste and it wasn’t so delicious.
We did a lot of protein. We've raised all sorts of things.
We have raised even human beings. Well, you might be able to, but we didn't do it.
But what we've confirmed is that the tool was too big and it was too expensive.
I started distributing it around the world and it was worth about $100,000.
And to find someone with 100 grand in their back pocket is not easy, so we wanted another little job.
And this project was actually for one of my students -- a mechanical engineer named Camille.
And we've done Camille and my team, we've moved all summer, how we make it cheaper, how we make it work better, how we make it so that others can make it.
Then we distributed it in schools between the seventh and eleventh grades.
And if you really want to humiliate, try to teach a child something.
And that's how I walked into that school and said, "Get it in 65% humidity."
One of the seventh graders said, "What's the humidity?"
I said, "Ha, it's the water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you're stupid.
And I said something like, "Well, don't trust me.
Actually-- don't trust me, do you?
Put it on 100.
Put it on 100, what happened?
He started condensing, making a fog, and then he started dripping.
And he said, "Oh. Humidity is rain.
Why didn't you just tell me that?"
We've made a connection to this that's a lot like the game.
They have a three-dimensional environment, which they can enter from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or small computers
They have different parts of the means - natural, sensors.
They choose recipes created by other boys anywhere in the world.
They choose the recipe, turn it on, and plant a seed.
And as it grows, they make changes?
They say, "Why does a plant need carbon dioxide?
Isn't it bad?"
If we increase the gas, the plant dies.
If we lower it, the plant grows well.
I harvest the plant, you have created a new digital recipe.
It is an interactive design and development and exploration process.
And then they can memorize that, and all the data on the new plant they've developed or the new digital recipe and what it did -- was it better or worse?
Imagine this as a small axis of operations.
We'll learn a lot.
And this is one of the food computers, as we call it, in a school three weeks later.
That's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it's the first time this boy has thought about becoming a farmer -- or that he's going to want to be a farmer.
That's why we opened all this to the public.
It's online, go home and try to build your first food computer.
That'd be hard -- that's what I'm telling you.
We're at first, but it's all there.
It's important to me that it's easy to enter.
And we'll keep trying to make it easier.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, botanist, economist, city planner.
They work on one basis what they are good at.
But we've grown a little bit more.
This is my facility that I just started working on.
The warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose him.
And inside this warehouse, we're going to build something like this.
And it's here now.
Look at it carefully.
It really does exist too.
One raises vegetables, another raises a vaccine for Ebola.
It’s great that these plants and the winner of the big advanced Defense Research Agency award are one of the reasons we’re ahead of Ebola.
Plants produce protein that is resistant to Ebola.
As well as pharmacists and food specialists, down to lettuce.
But these two things don't look like each other, and here I'm with my field.
Everything is different.
We've reached the strange "everything good" situation and it's like, "This is my black box --" and "No, buy my box."
"No, no, no -- I have very valuable intellectual property rights.
"Buy my box, not his box."
The truth is that we are still at the beginning, at a time when society is moving as well.
When we order more cheap food, we don’t order better eco-friendly food.
And when McDonald announces what's in the chicken balls, the weirdest food of all time -- and they base their marketing plan on it -- everything changes.
Now let's go into the world.
Private food computers, caterers and food data centers are working on an open phenomenon.
Think of an open genetic map, but we’ll put in it small climate recipes, such as Wikipedia, which can be turned on, turned on, and developed.
What does that look like in the world?
Remember the world is tied to threads?
We started to find lighthouses.
We started sending information about food, instead of sending food.
This is not my imagination, this is what we are actually publishing now.
Food computers and food servers, and soon food data centers, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not fighting for what is bad in this.
We know what's bad about this.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers and strengthening them with a base to ask and answer the question, “What if?”
Thank you.
There are times when I'm really ashamed to be European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, was pathetic.
There are a lot of contradictions,
We have deeply mourned the tragic death of a two-year-old Kurdish child, and since then, more than 200 children have later drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, but we have accepted that small Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe.
We regret the existence of human smugglers, but we have made it the only viable way to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a shortage of labor, but we have excluded those people who have our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We declare the liberal values that we have in opposition to fanatical Islam, but -- we have repressive policies that hinder asylum seekers, differentiate between children and their families, and detain refugee property.
What do we do?
How did the situation come to this extent, by adopting this inhumane policy to confront this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think the reason this is because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
But I think the reason for this is that our politicians lack a vision, a vision of how an international refugee regime was created more than 50 years ago to adopt the changing and globalized world.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, we all need to ask the two questions, and I'm going to have to ask the two questions.
First question, why doesn't the current system work?
And second, what can we do to fix this system?
The modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of World War II by these men.
Its main objective is to ensure that when the state fails, or worse happens, that the regime turns against its people, people find a place to go, to live in security and dignity so that they can return to their homeland.
It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and the International Commission, it has determined that states should reciprocate to people on their territory who are fleeing conflict and persecution.
Today, this system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
But in practice, our immigration policies are based on cutting the road to safety.
In theory, the refugee has the right to be integrated into society, or to be returned to the country from which he came from.
But in reality, they remain doomed to forget indefinitely.
In theory, the refugee issue is a shared global responsibility.
In practice, however, geography means that countries close to conflict take the vast majority of the world’s refugees.
This system has not been broken because its rules are wrong.
We have not adequately applied it in this changing world, and that is what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
But not from the top to the bottom in terms of the institutional perspective, rather than from the perspective of refugees.
So imagine a Syrian woman,
And let's call her a princess,
And a princess to me represents a lot of the people I've met in the area.
A princess, who represents about 25 percent of the world’s refugees, is a woman with children, and cannot return home because she came from this city that you see in front of you, Homs, a city that was once beautiful, historic and now under the rubble.
And so a princess can't go there.
It also has no hope for resettlement in a third country, because that as a lottery ticket is only available to less than one percent of the world’s refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that a princess can take her family to camp,
In which you can get help, but there are very few expectations in front of a princess and her family.
The camps are in bleak, barren, and often deserted places.
In Zaatari camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of shells at night across the border in Syria.
There is a restricted economic activity.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around the world, about 80 percent of refugees living in camps must stay for at least five years.
It’s a miserable life, and that’s probably why, in fact, only nine percent of Syrians have resorted to this option.
Instead, Amira can go to urban areas to neighboring cities, such as Amman or Beirut.
This option was made by about 75 percent of Syrian refugees.
But there's, too, too,
Refugees in these urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They usually don't have access to aid.
So when Amira and her family used their basic savings, they are more likely to face urban poverty.
So there is a third alternative for them, and that’s why our refugee numbers have increased
A princess can seek some hope for her family to risk their lives on a perilous journey to another country, and this is what we are witnessing in Europe today.
Around the world, we are faced with refugees who often have no other choice among the three options: camping, poverty in neighboring urban areas, or a perilous journey.
For refugees, this option is the global refugee system today.
But I think it's a wrong choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason for reducing these options is because we believe that these are the only options available to refugees, and there are no options.
Politicians framed the case as a zero-sum case, so that if we benefit from the refugees, we will impose costs on the citizens.
We tend to collectively assume that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.
But that's not necessarily what they can contribute to society,
What I would like to say is that we can expand those options so that they benefit everyone: host countries, communities, our communities and the refugees themselves.
So I would like to suggest four ways that we can change the way we think about the refugee issue.
All of these four methods have a common denominator: they are the same ways that lead us to globalization, mobility and markets, and to modernize the way we think about the issue of refugees.
The first way I would like to think about is the idea of enabling environments, which starts from a fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Along with my colleagues in Oxford, I embarked on a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
We have chosen Uganda not because it is representative of all host countries.
It's not. It's because it's extraordinary.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunities.
It gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences are extraordinary for both refugees and host communities.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own businesses that employ other people, and 40 percent of those employees are host country citizens.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens in the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional examples of thriving and vibrant entrepreneurial companies.
For example, in a settlement called Nakival, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
We found Rwandans who run the available business that allows young people to play computer games from recycled TVs and games,
Unlike the restrictions imposed on them elsewhere, the refugees innovate, and the man you see in front of you is a Congolese named Demo-Kay.
Demo-Kay arrived at this settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a way out.
He started with a local radio station, with a group of friends and colleagues, hired a video camera, and he's now a filmmaker, and he's a moviemaker.
He made two documentaries with our team and succeeded in setting up a very little business.
It is those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities that seek human prosperity.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter and food are all important in the emergency phase, but we also have to look further.
We need to provide opportunities for connectivity, electricity, education, right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the ways we take to reach the global economy can and must apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have practiced the same ways they have taken or have,
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still alternative realistic options that we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, accompanied by development economist Paul Collier, and we had an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to offer job opportunities to Syrians by supporting Jordan’s national development strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into work alongside the recruitment of Jordanian host citizens.
Just 15 minutes from Za’atari camp, there is a home to 83,000 refugees, the current economic zone called King Hussein Bin Talal Development Zone
The government has spent more than a hundred million dollars to connect it to the electricity grid and roads, but it lacks two things: access to work and internal investment.
What if the refugees were able to work there instead of being stuck in the camps, they would be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they returned to Syria?
We are aware that Jordan can benefit from this, whose development strategy requires a qualitative leap from a middle-income country to a manufacturing country.
It can benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to Syria’s post-conflict reconstruction by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the ultimate source of Syria’s reconstruction
We published the idea in the Foreign Affairs Magazine.
King Abdullah picked up this idea,
It was announced in London at the Syria conference two weeks ago and will be implemented next summer.
The third idea that I want to put in your hands the homogeneous preference between countries and refugees to reach happy results, such as what you see here in the selfies that include Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
What we rarely did was we asked the refugees what they wanted, and where they wanted to go, but what I care to say is that we can do it and make everyone better.
Economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of homogeneous markets, in ways that the order of preference for the parties constitutes a final homogeneity.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tittleboem have devised ways to apply that idea to refugees by asking refugees about their favorite places, but they also allow countries to classify the types of refugees they want to host based on skill or language standards and allow them to engage.
Now, of course, I needed to build quotas like diversity and vulnerability, but it's the way to increase the potential for integration.
The idea of integration was used successfully, for example, the involvement of students in universities, and the involvement of kidney donors with patients, and lies behind the algorithms on dating sites.
Why not apply the idea of giving refugees greater options?
It can also be used at the national level. As one of the big challenges we face is convincing local communities to accept refugees.
At the moment, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities, which is absolutely meaningless.
The homogeneity of the markets therefore provides a potential way to achieve those preferences together and to listen to the needs and demands of the same adjoined population and refugees.
The fourth idea that I want to put in your hands is humanitarian visas.
A lot of the tragedies and chaos that we've seen in Europe have been completely avoidable.
It stems from the fundamental contradiction in asylum policy in Europe: In order to obtain asylum in Europe, you have to come spontaneously through those perilous journeys that you have described.
But why should such dangerous flights be necessary when we are in the age of economical airlines and the capabilities of modern embassies?
It’s a very unnecessary trip, and last year, it led to the deaths of more than 3000 people on the borders of Europe and within European territory.
If refugees are simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we will avoid it, and there is a way to do this through something called a humanitarian visa, which allows people to get a visa at an embassy or consulate of a neighboring country where they simply pay for their trip through ships or flying to Europe.
About 1000 thousand euros is the cost of smuggling a refugee from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It cost €200 to fly by economy flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allow refugees to do this, it will have big positives.
You will save lives, we will completely block the smuggling market and the chaos we see on the front line of Europe in areas like the Greek islands.
It's the policy that prevents us from doing that instead of a rational solution,
And this idea has been applied,
Brazil has adopted a pioneering method, with more than 2000 Syrians having obtained humanitarian visas, and when they enter Brazil they receive a refugee description
Every Syrian with that project has refugee status and has been recognized as a real refugee.
There is another historical precedent as well,
Between 1922 and 1942, these passports were used as travel documents to allow the transfer of 45,000 Armenians, Chechens and Turks to travel through Europe and obtain refugee prescriptions elsewhere in Europe.
The International Bureau of Refugees was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this applicable strategy.
So all four ideas I've given you are a path through which we can expand the range of princess options, and we're going to be able to do that.
These are ways we can get great refugee options away from the three basic impossible options I’ve explained to you so you can leave others better.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that expands refugee options but realizes that they don’t have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yes, it is a humanitarian and responsible issue, but they are human beings with skills, talents and ambitions, and they have the ability to contribute. If we let them.
In the new world, migration is not on its way to extinction.
What we have seen in Europe will be present with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, and they will continue to be homeless, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this... It is not based on the old logic of humanitarian assistance, and is not based on the logic of charity, but is based on building the opportunities offered by mobility and globalized markets,
I assure you that we must wake up from our inattention and urge politicians to wake up to meet this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a little boy, I always dreamed about the ocean.
That wild place full of color and life was home to those imaginary aliens.
I filmed the big sharks dominating the food chain and saw the graceful sea turtles dancing around the reef.
As a marine biologist who became a photographer, I spent most of my career looking for magical places like the one I dreamed of when I was young.
As you can see, I've started discovering marine bodies at a relatively early age.
But the first time I dived deep into the water, I was ten years old.
And I still remember very well when I was swimming fiercely to get to that old cannon clad with shallow coral reefs.
And when I finally got to it, I looked up, I was surrounded by fish from everywhere in all the colors of the rainbow.
It was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Bischak, a conservation photographer for my 40s on this planet, had the opportunity to discover some of the stunning seascapes of National Geographic magazine and the Foundation for Protect Our Seas.
I've photographed everything from big sharks to those small that fit the palms of my hand.
I inhaled the suspicious smell of humpback whales, which was feeding a foot from me with the cold seas of Canada, the rainforest of the great bear."
I was familiar with the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Strait of Mozambique.
Everyone on this planet is affected by the ocean and influenced by it.
The ancient and clean seas I dreamed of as a child have become very difficult to find.
The seas are under greater pressure and more threatened.
As human beings, we continue to maintain our role as predators on Earth, and have witnessed and photographed many of these direct traces.
For a long time, I thought I'd shock my audience with their indifference through some disturbing photos.
Although this approach has advantages, I returned to the beginning.
I believe that the best way to change is to sell love.
I think I play the role of a rather ‘suitor’ and as a photographer, I have a rare opportunity to detect the animals and the entire ecosystems that lie beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can't fall in love with something and become a hero if you don't know it exists.
By revealing this -- this is the conservation photography force.
I have visited hundreds of marine sites, but only a few seascapes have caught my attention and have had a profound effect.
The first time I experienced that height was about 10 years ago, off the rugged and rugged coast of South Africa.
In June and July, huge swarms of sardines travel to the north in a mass migration of what we call “sardine escape.”
And those fish have a good reason to escape.
They are hunted by predators and agile animals.
Dolphins hunt in a common way and can disperse a swarm of sardines to create small, seductive groups of fish.
You lure the fish to the surface of the ocean and then rush to dinner to celebrate.
It is believed that the sharks are behind it.
Now, most people think that both sharks and dolphins are deadly enemies, but during the "escape of the sardines," they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to be effectively fed.
Without the help of dolphins, food balls are more common and sharks often end up eating so-called sardines, or with a mouth full of water.
Right now, after having had exciting moments with sharks during the Sardine Escape, I knew she didn't see me as a prey.
However, I’m slapped like any other guest during this very noisy feast.
From the shores of Africa, let's travel to the east, where the vast Indian Ocean is to the Maldives, an archipelago of atolls.
During the stormy southwestern monsoon, sea demon fish travel through the archipelago to a small spot in Baa Atol called Hapiro.
Large groups of crustaceans, most of which do not exceed the size of the pupil, are the basic food for sea demon fish.
When the amount of moss plants becomes small, the demon fish feed on their own and stir several times around themselves, like a small puppy chasing its tail.
When the amount of moss plants rises, the fish of the sea demons line up behind each other to form a long food chain, and if the first fish cannot eat, of course the loyal fish will take it.
The lower the algae in the Gulf, the closer the sea demon fish to each other, a unique behavior called cyclone-federed.
Since they hover in a narrow form, this group of sea demon fish creates a type of hurricane, absorbing the algae and advancing them into their mouths.
The experience of diving into hundreds of sea demon fish is truly unique and unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanivaro, this area was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my photos inevitably helped the Hannifaro region become protected.
Currently, fishermen from neighboring islands once caught sea demon fish to make traditional drums of the skin of these fish.
Today, they are some of the most enthusiastic conservatives and the Maldivian economy is gaining money because of sea demon fish over $8 million each year.
I've always wanted to go back in time in an age when maps were mostly empty or read, "There's a dragon."
Today, the closest place I have visited is the remote islands in the western Indian Ocean.
Away from the shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a moving reminder of what our oceans were once.
A few people have heard of Basas da Andia, a small patch of coral in the Mozambique canal.
They are coral people that represent a protective outer barrier and the inner lake is the nursery place for Galápagos sharks.
Those sharks were shy even during the day.
I had a feeling they'd be bolder and their number would go up at night.
I've never encountered many sharks on coral protrusions.
Filming moments like this and sharing them with everyone -- reminds me of why I chose this path.
At some point this year, I was on a mission to National Geographic in Baja California.
Around the middle of the road below the peninsula on the Pacific side is San Ignacio Lagoon, a place for the birth of gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast has witnessed a massacre, with more than 20,000 grey whales killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today the descendants of the same whales are pushing their young children to the surface to play and even interact with us.
These species have really seen a remarkable return.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Belmo, a quiet fishing island.
Decades of random fishing caused the collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the authorities to declare their waters as a marine reserve.
But what happened next was at least a miracle.
In 2005, just a decade after protection, scientists measured the extent of fish retrieval.
But don't hear a word from me-- come with me.
With just one breath, dive with me in the depths, one of the biggest places to ever be the fish I've ever faced.
We all have the power to create some kind of hope.
And by filming, I want to spread a message: it's not too late to protect our oceans.
I want to focus especially on the flexibility and ease of adaptation of nature to the face of 7.3 billion people.
I hope that in the future, I will look more and more to do images like this, creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
I hope it will become a daily event for me.
For prosperity and survival in my profession, you really have to be hopeless optimist.
And always work on the premise that the wonderful picture that will bring about change is only very close, behind the next coral, inside the next lake or perhaps in the lake that follows.
When she moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was the foundation of Zimbabwe’s national health policy.
The new government was resurrected after a long war of independence and immediately announced a socialist program: both health care and primary education services were essentially free.
Rural health centres have been heavily deployed, with nearly 80 per cent of the population having access to these services in less than two hours on foot, a huge achievement of its kind.
In 1980, the year of independence, about 25% of children were vaccinated in Zimbabwe.
By 1990, just a decade later, that figure was 80%.
I was very proud to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
That excitement and friendship were clear.
Working alongside the smart citizens of Zimbabwe – scientists, doctors, activists – I felt that I belonged not only to the African independence movement, but also to the public health movement in progress.
But there were huge challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year it was introduced.
I took care of a number of people with AIDS in early 1980, when I did medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what was in the Africa warehouse.
The infection rate increased by about 2% during the first days I was there.
This could rise for one in four adults 17 years after the time Harari left.
By mid-1990, I had learned about hundreds of people in a very young year who had been infected with HIV.
I've seen a lot of colleagues and friends die, my students and the hospital patients are dying.
In response to these cases, I, together with my colleagues, founded a hospital.
We've made several interventions to explain the use of condoms.
We have made interventions in places of education and work.
We did research. We gave guidance to the injured men’s partners on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at that time I thought I was doing my best.
I was offering an excellent treatment, like it was.
But I wasn’t talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke of his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations peacekeeping department.
On the 10-year anniversary of the genocide, he said: “I thought I was doing my best, but after the genocide I realized that there were a lot of things that could or should have been done to sound the alarm and join efforts to provide support.”
The AIDS epidemic has been decimated by the health of the community that was not ready, and today the World Health Organization has estimated that nearly 39 million people have died from the disease, not the only one who is overwhelmed with regret and regret that I did nothing more earlier.
But while I was living in Zimbabwe, I didn’t see myself as a supporter or a politician.
I was there to improve my technical skills, my epidemiological research skills
In my mind, my profession is to care for patients and do research to better understand the patterns of transmission among the population, and I was hoping to slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that the socially marginalized classes of the population were most at risk of contracting AIDS and dying.
For sugar cane plantation, which is more similar to a feudal system than any modern institution, 60 percent of pregnant women have been diagnosed with HIV.
I have worked to make it clear that the injury is not about moral decay, but about the culture of male superiority, forced migrant labor and colonialism.
As health professionals, our tools were very limited: we called on people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms and limit the number of partners.
When treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most powerful weapon against this virus, treatment was not available to the public sector in Africa.
I have not mentioned the unequal access to these life-saving medicines or the underlying economic and political systems that have been the cause of the infection rates among the population.
And I justified my silence by reminding myself that I was nothing but a guest in this country. And that sounding the alarm could cause me to get kicked out, prevent me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, and doing the research I desperately need.
So I didn't talk about the government's early position on AIDS.
I didn't express my fears out loud enough.
Some doctors and health professionals will think I haven't done anything wrong.
Our agreement with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its derivatives, is about the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.
And I've done everything I can for every patient.
But I knew that epidemics show how much schism exists in our society, which not only reflects biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization and exclusion, and discrimination related to race, gender, social classes, and more.
That's true for AIDS.
This was true recently in the case of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who has studied AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence structural because abuses lie in the organization on the economic and political level in our social world, often in ways that are invisible to people with privileges and power, and since violence is a reflection -- premature death, suffering and disease -- is a form of violence.
We do little for our patients if we fail to regulate these situations of social inequality.
The alarm is the first stage of spreading the right to public health, and it is the way to combine support efforts to get out of this situation and achieve some kind of change together.
So these days, I won't be quiet anymore.
I'll talk about a lot of things, even if the listeners don't feel comfortable, even if I don't feel comfortable either.
Many of my words will be related to racial and racial differences in institutions, things that are never supposed to exist in this country, and certainly not in the field of medical or public health.
But it exists, and we pay them to end our lives prematurely.
That’s why the alarm bell should ring around the impact of racism on health in the United States of America, and the ongoing violence between individuals and within institutions and black people, who have been more than double our tragic legacy for 250 years of slavery, 90 years of implementing the Jim Crowe laws and 60 years of turbulent equality, ringing the alarm bell about this essential and central to doing my job properly as the New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature death -- meaning death before the age of 65 -- is 50% higher for black people than for white people.
A black woman in 2012 had a risk of dying more than 10 times at birth than a white woman.
Although we have made great strides in reducing infant mortality, black infants face almost three times the risk of dying in their first year compared to white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics correspond to other statistics across the United States.
A recent analysis by the New York Times found that 1.5 million black people are missing.
They have pointed out that more than one in six black men who are supposed to be between the ages of 25 and 45 have been lost and disappeared from daily life, and have been imprisoned or died prematurely.
This is a great kind of inequality in the daily and inappropriate violence faced by young black people, and the recent protests have centered on the slogan #Black_Skin_Her Life.
But we have to remember that permanent and varying proportions and the consequences of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes and AIDS -- diseases that can lead to death slowly and quietly and may take many of the lives of black people prematurely.
Since the #BlackSkin_Heranity is adventurous movement, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community had opposed the use of the word “racism” in our research and studies.
You probably felt something every time I pronounced that word.
Our medical students protested the Dai-Ins method in their white blouses, but the medical community has negatively supported this since discrimination continues to affect the level of disease for people and deaths.
I am concerned about the trend of precision and personalized medicine, in search of biological or genetic goals for better treatments, which may inadvertently cause us to deviate from the overall picture of the subject, which is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves and most importantly, determining the health of the population, and for many of us, “poor health.”
As health professionals, in our daily work, both in the hospital and when doing research, we are witnessing a state of great inequality: a person who is ill and unable to follow medical advice because he has other priorities, young transgender people who are thinking about suicide because our society is very cruel, a single mother who should feel responsible for her son’s poor health.
Our role as health professionals lies not only in treating our patients, but also to ring the alarm bell and call for change.
Whether it is credible or not, our community position gives our voices great credibility, and we should not give up on that.
I regret not talking about Zimbabwe, and I have made a promise to myself that as a health commissioner in New York City, I will take every opportunity to ring the alarm bell and join efforts to support equity in the health field.
I’ll talk against racism and hope you join me, and I’ll join you when you talk about sexism or any other form of equality.
It is time for us to rise up and speak out loud about structural inequality.
We don’t have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, and our health, all depend on it.
Well, by raising your hands, how many of you have canceled someone's friendship on Facebook because they said something disturbing about politics or religion, child protection or food?
And how many of you are trying to ignore at least one person because you simply don't want to talk to them
You know, we just had to follow Henry Higgins’s advice at My Fair Lady: sticking to the talk about weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and the fight against vaccines, those topics -- they're also not safe.
So this world in which we live, this world in which every conversation has the power to turn into an argument, where politicians cannot talk to each other and since even the most insignificant issues find someone to fight for or against them emotionally, it is not normal.
Pyo Research conducted a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, more divided, than at any time in history.
And we're unlikely to have compromise, and that means we don't listen to each other,
We make decisions about where we live, who we marry, and even who they will be our friends, depending on what we believe in before.
Again, that means we don’t listen to each other.
The conversation requires the tide between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, this conversation we lose that balance.
Now, part of that is due to technology.
Smartphones that are either in your hands or close enough so that they can be accessed quickly
According to Pew Research, about a third of Americans send more than 100 messages a day.
Many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to share messages with their friends than to watch them face to face.
There is an excellent article in the Atlantic magazine.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his children a project of communication.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular topic without using the notes.
And he said, "I've realized... "
I realized that being able to talk is probably one of the most skills we’ve failed to teach.
Children spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely have a chance to hone their interpersonal communication skills.
This may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves: is there any skill in the 21st century that is more important than being able to maintain a coherent and confident conversation?
Now, I’m talking directly to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people I love. I'm talking to people I don't like.
I talk to some people I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I would like to use the next ten minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this matter, things like looking at a person’s eye while talking, thinking in advance about interesting topics to discuss, looking and moving the head and smiling to show that you are his mouthbilk, repeating what you’ve just heard or summing it up.
I want you to forget all that.
Because that's stupid!
There’s no reason for you to learn how to show attention if you’re really paying attention.
Now, I actually use the same skills in professional interviews that I do in normal life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to meet people, and that's actually gonna help you learn how to become better interlocutors.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time and without getting bore, rightly by God, without offending anyone.
We all had previous important conversations.
We've done it before, and we know what it looked like.
The type of conversation you’re leaving with and feeling inspired with, or feeling with it that you’ve communicated deeply or that you’ve been understood excellently.
There is no reason why most of your relationships are not the same as their predecessors.
So I have 10 basic rules that I'm going to explain to you, but honestly, if you only pick one of them and apply them, you'll have a great conversation.
Number one: Do not do multiple tasks.
And I don't mean here to leave your mobile phone, tablet, car keys, or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean, be present-minded.
Live the moment.
Don’t think about the argument between you and your boss.
And don't think about what you're gonna have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don’t be half inside and half the conversation outside!
Don’t cling to your opinion.
If you want to put your opinion without giving any chance to respond or discuss, or increase and develop your idea, write a blog.
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't let critics be on my show: because they're really boring.
If they were conservatives, you would find them hating Obama, food stamps and abortion.
If they were liberals, they would hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
We can predict that completely.
And you don't want to be.
You need to enter every conversation on the assumption that you have something you would like to learn.
As the famous physician, Scott Beck said, it requires proper hearing by putting yourself aside.
Sometimes that means canceling your personal opinion.
If we sense this acceptance, he said, the speaker will become less likely and more likely to open up what is in his heart and what is inside his mind to the listener.
Again, let's say you want to learn something.
As Bill Nye said, “Everyone you’re going to meet knows something that you don’t know. "
And I put it this way: everyone is an expert in something.
Third, use open-ended questions.
In this case, the reference is journalists
Start your questions with what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complicated question, you will get an easy answer.
If I asked you, "Were you terrified?"
You will respond to the most powerful word in the sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer will be "yes, I was" or "No, I was not."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let them describe it, they know.
Try asking them questions like, "How was it?"
"How did that feel?"
Because then they might have to stand up for a moment and think about it, and so you'll get more enjoyable answers.
Fourth: Walk with the current.
This means that ideas will come to your mind and what you need is to make those thoughts come out of your brain.
I've often heard interviews in which guests talk for a few minutes and then the host comes back and asks a question that seems to be coming from nowhere or has already been answered,
This meant that the host had stopped listening for two minutes because he thought of this brilliant question, and he was determined to say it.
We do the same.
We sit with someone we talk to, and suddenly we remember that day when we met Hogg Jackman at the coffee shop.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas that will come to your mind,
And you need to let these ideas go and come.
Fifth, if you don’t know, say you don’t.
People on the radio and especially on stations like NPR, are much more aware that they are recording, so you find them more cautious about the things they claim to be experts in and the things they claim to be confident about.
Do it carefully.
Talking should not be cheap.
Don’t compare your experience with theirs.
If they’re talking about losing a family member, don’t talk about when you lost a family member.
If they’re talking about some of the problems they face at work, don’t talk to them about how much you hate your job.
The issue is not the same, and it will not be.
Every experiment can be taken separately.
And more importantly, it's not about you.
You don’t need to talk and try to show how amazing you are or how much you have suffered in the past.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking how he was smart, and he said, “I have no idea. Because people who boast about their IQ are losers.”
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Seventh: Don’t try to bring yourself back.
Because it's kind of self-underestimating and boredom, and we do it a lot.
Especially in business conversations or in conversations with our children, we want to get to a certain point, so we’re just reshaping the talk over and over.
Don't do that.
Eighth: Stay away from weeds.
And what I mean, frankly, is that people don't care about years and names, dates, and all these details that you struggle to remember.
They don't care about that, and what they care about is you.
They care about what you like, and what things you have in common.
So, forget these details and leave them.
Ninth: This is not the last point, but the most important point.
Listen up.
I may not be able to tell you how many people have told you that listening can be the most important skill they can develop.
Buddha said, and I’m here to put it to you, if your mouth is open, you won’t learn.”
Calvin Coolidge said, “Nobody has lost their job because of their excessive listening.”
Why don't we hear each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am under control.
And I don't need to hear anything I'm not interested in.
And so I'm the center of attention.
I can boost my identity.
But there is another reason: our attention is being distracted.
The average person speaks about 225 words per minute, but we can hear 500 words per minute.
So our minds are busy and full of 275 words like that.
I also know that it takes energy and effort to pay attention to someone, and if you can’t do it, you’re not actually talking.
You are two people who scream and barely say some sentences in the same place.
So we have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it beautifully.
He said: “Most of us don’t listen to understanding.
But he listens only with the intention of replying. "
Another rule is the tenth rule, which is short talk.
[Good conversation like a short skirt. They are short enough to bring attention, and long enough to cover the awrah - my sister] all this boils down to the same basic concept, which is: be interested in others.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there were certain rituals in my house.
People would come to talk to my grandparents, and after they would go, my mom would come to us, and she would tell us, "Do you know who that was?"
She was the runner-up to Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a famous Russian ballet dancer."
So I grew up on this assumption that everyone has something special hidden from them.
And frankly, I think that's what made me the best hostess.
It is that I try as much as I can to keep my mouth shut, my mind open, and I’m always ready to be amazing, and I’ve never been disappointed.
And you have to do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly be ready to be amazed.
Thanks.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams. I'm a hero.
I won medals in three different sports and at the National Games in Canada, I played internationally in basketball and I am proud to have represented Canada globally.
I train five days a week on basketball and speed skating, working with high-level coaches and mental performance consultants to be in the best shape of my sport.
By the way, it's all during the Special Olympics.
Does that change your idea of me and my accomplishments?
The world is not like me as heroes.
Not long ago, people like me were outcasts and hiding out of sight.
There have been a lot of changes since the 1968 Special Olympics, but in many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to others everywhere.
People use derogatory words in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
You use the word “late” or “late” in a humiliating way.
They don't pay attention to how much my pain and my friends' pain.
I don't want you to think that being here because I represent a humanitarian issue.
And I'm here because there's still a big problem with the way people with intellectual disabilities are treated, or, most often, how they don't pay attention at all.
Did you know that this year's World Games were organized?
I was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in Los Angeles.
There were more than 62,000 spectators who followed the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSN and ESPN.
Do you know what happened?
What comes to your mind when you see someone like me?
I'm here today to challenge you to look at us in an equal way.
The Special Olympics Games make a difference in the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and in the perceptions of followers.
For those who are not familiar with it, the Special Olympics is aimed at athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Olympics and the Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality sports mobile programs for people with intellectual disabilities that can make changes to their lives and ideas.
This activity has changed my life and the lives of many.
It changed the way the world perceives those with intellectual disabilities.
Born with epilepsy and mental disability.
As I got older, I played hockey to age 12,
The older I get, the more I feel it’s hard to communicate with everyone, and you’re angry and frustrated.
I haven’t played any sports for a while, I didn’t have many friends and I felt abandoned and sad.
There was a period when people with intellectual disabilities were hiding out of the sight of society.
They didn’t think they could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion that the lack of opportunity to participate has caused fitness.
Many questioned the extent to which people with intellectual disabilities benefited from fitness programs and opportunities behind sports competitions.
But pioneers such as Dr. Hayden and Yonis Kennedy Shriver, the founders of the Special Olympics, are persevering and persisting, and the Special Olympics players have proven to be right more than four and a half million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous, because I was young, timid, unsure of myself and I didn’t have many friends.
When you got there, everyone was cheering, working to support you and leaving the way to be yourself without making any prejudices.
I am now a basketball player and skater who has competed in several regional and national competitions, and this year he was able to attend the Summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first Canadian to join the basketball team and compete at the level of the World Games.
I am one of more than four million and five hundred athletes from all over the world, and I have heard many similar stories.
Being an athlete at the Special Olympics Games has allowed us to regain our self-esteem and dignity.
The Special Olympics Games address critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than ordinary men, and that women with intellectual disabilities are 20 years younger than those without disabilities.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by being lively and participating in the sport.
The trainers taught us the dietary and health rules.
Special Olympics also provide free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with a direct doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, I played with my Canadian team against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian basketball team underwent a special health check for the world’s athletes, with 7 out of 10 players getting free headphones and being able to hear clearly for the first time.
The change they had was amazing.
They were more enthusiastic, happy and confident, because their coach was able to communicate with them with words.
And their emotions because they were able to hear the sound of basketball, the sound of the whistle, and the fans in the stands -- that sounds like a Muslim and self-evident thing.
The Special Olympics is not just a change for athletes.
You also change their lives off the field.
This year, research has shown that nearly half of U.S. adults don’t know anyone with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans who have no personal contact with people with intellectual disabilities are less acceptable and positive.
Then there are those hurtful and humiliating words that prove that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to many people.
People use them as if they were just passing words or a path to humiliation.
I’ve mentioned in the form of tweets more than nine million times last year, it was very painful for me and for the four million and five hundred athletes around the world.
Not many consider it an insult, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and world envoy John Franklin Stevens wrote in an open letter to political critics who used it as an insult, “Join us one day at the Special Olympics.
Let's see if you're leaving and nothing has changed inside you."
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people stood in a long line for hours to attend the weightlifting competition finals.
Everyone stood only when my colleague Jackie Barrett, a mega-man from Newfoundland, lifted 655 pounds, and raised 611 pounds in a squat position. This sets a new record at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder among all athletes in Newfoundland – not just in the Special Olympics, but in the overall weightlifting sport.
Jackie was a bright star in Los Angeles, and she was impressed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, a few thought that people with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous Los Angeles Memorial Amphitheater to see the opening ceremony of the World Games and encourage athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Away from being we were hiding out of sight, we were getting encouraged and celebrated.
The Special Olympic Games teach athletes confidence and self-pride.
The Special Olympics has provided a lesson to the world that people with special needs deserve respect and inclusion.
I now have my dreams and ambitions associated with this sport, good coaches, respect and dignity, good health, and I practice as a personal trainer.
I'm no longer one of those who hide and get bullied, and here I am, the oldest conversation at TED.
The world has become a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but the road is still long.
So the next time you meet someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you can see their abilities.
The next time someone next to you uses those mean words, please tell them the pain they leave behind.
Please consider participating in the Special Olympics.
I'd like to continue with one last thought.
As Nelson Mandela said, “Sport has the potential to make a difference in the world.”
The Special Olympics is changing the world by making changes in four million and five hundred athletes and allowing us to be confident, to make friends, not to prejudge, to feel that sense and to be heroes.
Thank you very much.
You may not have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Auro, Nigeria.
But I know they're the most unusual places on Earth.
In the hospitals there, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists quietly fighting one of the most deadly dangers of humanity for years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
It can cause severe and often fatal fever.
But these people put their lives at risk every day to protect the people in their communities, and in doing so, they protect us all.
But one of the most unusual things I've ever learned about them in one of my first visits there in several years has been that they start every morning -- these challenges, unusual days on the front lines -- by singing.
They gather together and show their joy.
They show their spirits.
And over the years, year after year, when I visit them and visit me, I meet with them, I sing, we write and we love this, because this reminds us that we are not here to pursue science together, we are linked together through our common humanity.
And that, as you can imagine, is certainly becoming very important, and even essential, as something for the beginning of change.
This changed a great thing in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This is the first epidemic in West Africa, along with the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
That was scary, scary for all of us.
We were actually suspects for a while. Lassa and Ebola were spreading more than expected, and we said that it could one day come to Kenema.
So some of the members came out of my team immediately and joined Dr. Homar Khan and his team there, and we prepared a diagnosis to be able to get partial sensitivity tests to catch Ebola if it came across the border and inside Sierra Leone.
We were already preparing these tests for the Lassa virus, we knew how to do this, the team was great.
We just had to give them the tools and the place to look for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On 23 May 2014, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of the hospital, and the team conducted these important molecular tests and identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an extraordinary job that was done.
They were able to diagnose the condition immediately, to safely treat the patient and start a tracking connection to find out what was going on.
I stopped something.
But by that day the epidemic had broken out for months?
In hundreds of cases, he's already overwhelmed all previous epidemics.
I come to Sierra Leone not as an individual case, but as a big wave.
We had to work with the global community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema. Let's start with those cases, where he brought the next week 31, then 92, and then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that can face this.
And we've worked around the clock trying to do our best, trying to help these people, trying to get attention, but we've also done something else simple.
From that sample we took from the patient's blood to find out Ebola, we can get him out, clearly.
The other thing we can do, actually, is that we're stopping it chemically, putting it in a box and then sending it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we worked around the clock, dividing us in shifts, day after day, and quickly produced 99 genomes for the Ebola virus.
This is the scheme - the viral genome is the scheme.
We all have one.
He says everything inside us, he says so much.
The result of such a work is simple and powerful.
We can actually take these ninety different viruses, watch and compare them, and we can see, in fact, a comparison of three genes, and this has happened before and spread from Guinea, we can show the beginning of the outbreak in rich people months ago, once for humans, and then move from one human to another.
Now, this is very important when you're trying to figure out how to interfere, but the important thing is tracking.
We can also see that the virus, during transmission between humans, is mutating.
And every shift from this is very important, because of the diagnosis, the vaccinations, the treatments we use, they're all shown on this genetic sequence, basically -- that's what it's driving.
And so global health experts have to respond, they have to evolve, to examine everything they've been doing.
But the way science worked, and the place where I was at that moment was, that I had the information, I could work in a silo for a lot, a lot of months, analyze the information with caution, by slowing down the oldest paper to publish, ordered during several attempts back and forth, and finally when the paper was published, we could disclose the information.
That's how it works right now.
Well, that wouldn't have been useful at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines and for us it was clear that what we needed was help, a lot of help.
And so the first thing we did was, once the sequence came out of the machines, we posted it online.
We spread it to the whole world and we said, "Help us."
And help came.
Before we knew her, we were being contacted from all over the world, impressed by the sighting of the information abroad and his post.
Some of the greatest virus followers in the world suddenly became a part of our society.
We were working together on this virtual road, sharing, regular calls, communicating, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to find ways to stop it.
There are a lot of ways we can be communities like this.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic began to spread globally, was coming out to learn, to participate, to bring together.
Everyone wants to play a role.
The amount of human capacity out there was great, and the Internet brought us all together.
And you can imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, that's all we said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together, let's make it happen."
But the problem was that the information we all use, searching the internet, is too limited to do what we need to do.
And with many opportunities, it was lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the epidemic in Kenema, we had 106 cases of patients, and again we did this publicly available to the world.
In our labs, we were able to show that you can take the 106 records, we can train the computer to predict and predict Ebola patients with almost 100% accuracy.
And we made an app that could spread this, to make this available to health care workers in the field.
106 is not enough to make that strong, to be proven.
So we're waiting for more information to release it.
That information has not yet come.
We're still waiting, maneuvering away, in the silos instead of working together.
And just -- we can't accept this.
You, all of you, you can't accept this.
It's our life on the line.
And in fact, in fact, we've lost a lot of souls, a lot of health care workers, including my dear colleagues, five colleagues of Mbalo Fonni, Alex Moj Boy, dr. Homar Khan, Alice Kovama and Mohamed Fula.
These are only five of the many health care workers in and around Kenema who died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and privately.
So, Ebola, like all the dangers to humanity, it's a fireplace of distrust, confusion, and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight between us, the virus thrives.
But not like the rest of the dangers to humanity, Ebola is the only one in which we are all the same.
We're all in that war together.
Ebola on someone’s doorstep could soon be on our doorstep.
So in this place with the same weaknesses, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hope, I hope that we will work together with joy.
A graduate student was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I discovered the word "Kinema," the hospital where we work, and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, named after the word "Mindy" means "purity like a river, transparent and open to the public. "
That was very deep for us, because without knowing this, we always felt that it was a tribute to the people in Kenema where we were working, we had to work openly, we had to participate and work together.
And we should have done that.
We all have to demand this for us and for others -- to be open to each other when another epidemic occurs, to fight in this war together.
Because this is not the first Ebola epidemic and it won't be the last, and there's a lot of other microbes outside waiting, like the Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it can happen in a million-sizey city, it can start there.
It could be something that travels through the air.
It can even be published intentionally.
And I know it's scary. I understand that, but I also know, and this experience will show us that we have the technology and we have the ability to succeed in this thing, so let's make it and be the one with the top word on viruses.
But we can only if we do it together and if we do it with fun.
And that's for Dr. Khan and for all those who gave their lives in the first rows of this war with us always, to be with them in the war always,
And let's not let the world be known for the devastation caused by a single virus, but lit by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
