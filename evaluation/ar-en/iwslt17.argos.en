Well, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Ribeczinski.
She's a scientist in the old pits, which means she's competent to spray the very old dead.
Yeah, there's someone calling me "Dr. Dead organisms."
I think it's particularly interesting because of the drilling places to look for these things, up the Arctic Circle in Canadian distant dragons.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at a dug site called a camel stove, which falls on less than 10 degrees of latitude away from the attractive Arctic.
Natalia, it's really not gonna sound so exciting, because you spend the whole day walking with your backpack, the location system, a notebook, and you pick up anything that might seem fossilized.
At some point, I noticed something.
Natalia, something rusty, kind of rusty color, the size of my hand.
It was lying on the roof.
At first I thought it was just a splinter of wood, because such things were found in that place by-- plant parts of prehistoric age.
But that night, on the way back to camp...
Natalia... took out the lens of the hand, checked it carefully and realized that he didn't carry tree ring tracks.
Maybe something was carefully saved, but it really resembles...
Bones.
For the next four years, Nasser went to the site repeatedly, and eventually collected 30 fragments of the same bones, most of them really small.
Not a big group. It's a little Zeblock bag.
Nasser Latif, and I tried to bring her together like a piece of pictures.
But it was a challenge.
Natalia was broken into several small pieces, tried to use sand and pastures, but it doesn't look good.
Ultimately, we used a 3-D scanner.
Nice Nasser.
Nice Nasser.
It's kind of magic when it fits together.
How sure you're doing it right?
Is there any way to bring it together in another way and get paracket, for example?
No, we got this.
Nice Nasser: what I got, I found out, was the tib of the leg, the bone of the leg, specifically, belonging to the shade mammal, something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been one of them.
It was too big.
Natalia, the size of this thing was huge, it was a big animal.
What animal can it be?
She introduced one of the fragments to some of her Colorado colleagues, and they had an idea.
Natalia, we took a saw, we made a hole in it, and it smelled interesting.
It smelled like burnt meat.
It was a smell Natalia knew about her skull story at the anatomy lab: cologne.
Collagine is what gives a structure to our bones.
Usually, after many years, it collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic was like a natural refrigerator and it was preserved.
But a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Priestol, and she met a colleague named Mike Buckley who was explaining a new operation called the "Colagin fingerprint."
It was found that the various items had slightly different structures of colajine, if they obtained the combination of unknown bones, you could compare them with known items, and who knows, they might get a match.
So she sent one to him, Videx.
Yeah, you want to follow that. It's kind of important.
- No. He treated her, compared her to 37 known species in our time of mammals.
And he got a match.
The 3.5 million-year bone found by Natalia from the Upper Arctic was found to be...
A camel.
And come to me, what? That's amazing-- if it's true.
They checked all the fragments, and they got the same score.
However, based on the size of the bones detected, this means that this camel is 30% greater than the beauty of modern times.
This camel will be about 9 feet tall, and it's almost half a ton.
Yes,
Natalia found a giant ice from the Arctic.
Now, when he hears the word "gl", what might come to mind is one of these, the two-year sentences of the Middle East and Central Asia.
But the chances of a picture painted in your mind are one of these, the only sperm, the creature of the core desert -- expanding in hot sandspots such as the Middle East and the desert, on its back, a large old water storage ground for long desert flights, have two large feet and two bites to help them climb sand dunes.
So how did one of them end up here in the Upper Arctic?
Well, scientists have long known, as it turns out, even before Natalia finds out, that beauty is actually American.
They showed up first time here.
For nearly 40 million years beauty has been around, it can only be found in North America, approximately 20 different species, perhaps more.
If I put it in a group, would it look different?
Yeah, you'll have different sizes.
Some will have a very long neck, so they actually look like a giraffe.
Some of them are noses, like crocodiles.
Natalia, the primitive of it was already small, almost like rabbits.
Nice Nasser.
Old Natalia.
So you won't be able to identify her, perhaps.
Oh, my God.
I know, wouldn't that be great?
Latif Nasser: About three or seven million years ago, a group of beauty flew towards South America, where Lama and Albakah became, and another group crossed the Japsah Beringya bridge towards Asia and Africa.
Then before the end of the last glacier era, beauty extinct in North America.
Scientists already knew all that, but it's still hard to explain how Natalia found one in the far north.
Low temperature, polar versus desert.
To be fair now, three and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22 degrees Celsius, warmer than it is now.
It would have been northern forests, more like Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, like, it'll be six months long as the waterhole freezes.
It may strike snow storms.
The night extends for 24 hours in a row.
Like, how... How?
How could one of the desert stars survive and live in such polar conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues thought they had the answer.
And it's kind of cool.
What if the advantages we imagine make the camel adjust in places like desert, have actually evolved to help him cope with winter?
What if he's not supposed to slide his sands, but ice, like ski shoes?
What if that threshold-- and it was surprising for me, doesn't contain water, but it contains fat-- exists to help the camel face the six winter months. When the food is scarce?
And then, long after she crossed the bridge, did she adjust the advantages of winter to adjust to the warm Saharan environment?
For example, the threshold may be good for beauty in hot climates because all fat is in one place, such as a fat backpack, which means that it does not need all this insulation in the rest of the body.
So it helps to waste the heat easier.
This is a crazy idea, it seems to be evidence that the perfect nature of the desert can be evidence of the ancient Arctic.
I'm not the right person to tell you this story.
Others said that it was a means to wonder from evolutionary biology or a future key to climate change.
But I like it for totally different reasons.
For me, this story is about us, about how we see the world and how that changes.
I was trained as a chief.
I knew that, in fact, many scientists were also historians.
They made sense of the past.
You tell us the history of the universe and the planet we live in.
And as a date, you start with an idea in your mind about how the story ends.
We make up stories and stick to them, like a camel in the desert, right?
That's a great story!
He obviously lived there forever.
But at any moment, some evidence can be discovered.
You can learn some small things that make you reshape everything you think you know.
Like, in this case, one scientist found one piece of what I thought was wood, and because of that, science has become a completely new theory that is totally incompatible with what this creature looks like.
And for me, that totally turned the way I thought about the camel.
It was transformed from a silly creature fit only for one specific environment, to be a traveler in the world that happened to be in the desert, could end up almost anywhere.
I give you Azuri.
Azuri, hi. How are you?
Well, here, I got one of these for you.
Azuri enjoys a break from his regular annoying in the music hall of Radio City.
Not just a joke.
Anyway-- but, Azuri is among us as a living reminder that the story of our world is lively.
It requires readiness to control, and habitual imagination.
Right, Azuri?
And we're just a little bit away from seeing the world again.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how bad they are.
I would like to tell you today about this problem and how we can fix it with nerves.
First, I'd like to return you to a cold night in the 2011 neighbourhood that had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting in a local bar outside of Columba University. When I studied computer science and neuroscience, I was with one of the fellow students in the midst of an interesting conversation about the ability of imagery to replace computers one day.
And while we're going to get to the most interesting part of the conversation, it's definitely flapping.
He pulled it up and looked at it and started printing.
Then he started to force his eyes to look at me and he says, "Find you my focus."
But, of course, his eyes were connected to the hath, and the moment died.
On the other side of the bar, I noticed another student with his phone. This time he was with a group.
He was scanning pictures on Instagram, and those kids were laughing hysterically.
And this duplication between my sense of humiliation and their sense of happiness around the same technology. You pushed me to think.
Whenever I looked forward to it, I realized that the negative factor in the equation was not digital information, it was simply the subject of the screen that separates me from my friend and it was a gathering of those boys.
As you can see, they were gathered around something, just like our ancestors who developed their social monopoly, telling stories about camp fire.
And that's exactly the role of tools, I think.
Its role lies in extending our bodies.
And I think today's computers are doing the opposite.
Whether you send an e-mail to your wife or you're making a musician or a friend's consolation, you do it almost the same way.
You're leaning over those retards, pushing buttons, lists and more rectangles.
And it occurred to me that this is the wrong way, I think we can use a more near-natural machine.
We need to use machines to get our work back on the ground.
We need to use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to stretch our senses instead of reducing them.
I want the circumstances to have such a machine with me.
It's called Meta 2.
Let's try it.
I see the audience right in front of me, and I see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we'll see a spectral image, a very realistic spectacle appearing in front of me, in front of my glasses that I'm wearing now.
And this could be anything we can shop for or learn from, and I can use my hands and move them so easily.
I think the iron man would be proud.
We'll be back in a moment.
Now, if you're like me, your mind must be rid of the possibilities of what this technology will allow us to do, let's look at each other.
My mother is an architect, so it's natural that the first I imagined was a building in a three-dimensional space instead of using these multidimensional schemes.
She's touching the drawings at this moment and picking Decora internally.
All this was filmed through the Go Prue camera through our own glasses.
This second use is private to me. It's the Professor's glass brain project, thanks to the University of California in San Francisco.
As a neuroscientist, I always dream of the ability to learn and preserve all these complex brain buildings by a real machine, enabling me to touch and manipulate different brain buildings.
What you see is called enhanced reality, but for me it's connected to a more complex story -- a story of how we can extend our body's abilities by digital devices instead of doing the opposite.
Now...
I think in the next few years, humanity will go through some sort of transformation.
We'll start putting a whole layer of digital information on the ground.
Imagine for a moment what this might mean to the novelists, to the painters, to the brain surgeons, to the designers of the internal decorator and perhaps to all present today.
And what I think we need to do as a community. Trying and doing an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends from human experience, instead of making our reality a game or stifling digital information in it.
And this is my passion.
I want to share a little secret with you.
Five years later -- this is not the smallest device -- after almost five years, it'll all look like glass tapes on our eyes showing specimens.
And as we don't care about any vibration we're buying about the gear we're buying because of the operating system -- as a neurosurgeon, I've always dreamt of a mental operating system.
And it's important to do it the right way, because we may have lived inside these things at least our whole lives by the face of the drawings from Windows.
And I don't know about you, but living in Windows scares me.
To isolate the facade months from the end, we use nerve science to guide our design principles rather than let a group of designers fight around them in the conference room.
And the principle we all want is called "the less resistant nervous path."
At every turn, we get between the mental system and our brains for the first time.
Meaning we're trying to make a user-friendly computer.
We build a system that you always knew how to use.
These are the first three design principles we use in this new user experience.
Principle one and most importantly, you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract. And it requires a greater effort to unravel it.
It works against the less resistant nervous path.
While in fact enhanced, you can, of course, put the spectral image of TED here, the spectral image of your e-mail on this side of the office, and your position memory has evolved so that it can be found.
You can put the body of Tesla you want to buy, or whatever my legal team asked me to put before the show.
Great. Your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
The second principle we call it "touch to see."
What do kids do when they see something that's interesting?
They're trying to reach him and touch him.
And that's exactly how the natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call a deep sense -- it's the sense of internal membership.
So by touching our work directly, we will not only be able to control it better, but we will also understand it more deeply.
And from it, the idea of "the touch to see."
But it's not enough to try things ourselves.
We're social leaders.
Which leads me to the third principle, the campfire of our first story.
Our feminine nerve cell indicates that we can communicate better with each other and with our work if we can see each other's faces and hands in three dimensions.
If you look at the video behind me, you see the users of a dead device playing with the same spectral image, connecting with the eyes and connecting to this thing, instead of distracting them with the external machinery.
Let's try this again with neuroscience.
So, our favorite operating system, the mental operating system.
I'm going to step forward and take this glasses and leave it here by the office.
I'm here with you at this moment, we're in touch.
You do my post-op memory, and I can take it and bring it to me, remind me that I am the riot system.
And my deep sense of humor works, and I can blow these glasses to millions of pieces and touch the sensor that wipes my fingerprint now.
But seeing things alone isn't enough. After a second, my partner will make a triple-dimensional call.
How are things?
I can see him in front of me in three dimensions.
And it's so real.
Thank you.
This will replace the frequencies by the feminine nerve cell in the distant future.
How are things?
: Great. We're on direct.
I give the public the gift of the spectral brain we saw in the video earlier.
That's not only gonna change the hooks, but also the way we cooperate.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
This is the message that was discovered at that bar in 2011. The future of computers is not in one of these screens.
He's here. Inside us all.
If there's one idea I want to put to you, it's that the natural machine is not a fantasy of the future, it's here in 2016.
That is why all 100 people in Meta, including the management team, executive directors, designers and engineers -- and before TED2017, we will throw our monitors and replace them with a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Thank you all.
Let me know one thing. Because it provided a few illustrative presentations on the enhanced reality almost over the past year.
There is scope among technological experts. The subject is, are we actually seeing something real on the screen?
There is a matter of vision, in ways that technology shows us a broader vision than it can see across the glasses.
Was what we saw real?
Sure.
Not only that, but we took extra precautions to film it through the lens at the GoPo camera in the various footage we saw.
We want to simulate the real experience we see through the glasses, without any tricks.
Thank you for showing us that:
I'm from the most liberal, tolerant spot in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a great family of Seattle.
My mother was an artist. My father was a professor. And I'm really grateful to them for raising me, because I've always felt completely comfortable planning my life exactly the way it suits me.
As a matter of fact, I took a path other than that my father was planning.
When I was 19 years old, I left college-- I left it, got fired, said what you wanted.
Then I took a course as a professional in playing the French horn that was my life's dream.
I played theatrical music all over America and Europe, and I roamed for a few years with the great jazz guitar player Charlie Bird.
At the end of my 20s, I became a member of the Symphony Barcelona Orchestra in Spain.
What's greatest of life.
And to learn, my parents never complained.
You support me through my path.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, our son, in a break for a decade.
And--and yet there was a big conversation about my lifestyle I'd like to tell you.
I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona, and I visited my father for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mom and we were alone in the kitchen.
It was quiet, very quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
And your father and I are really worried about you.
I said, "What?" I mean, what is it, now?
I want you to be completely honest with me:
Well, the truth is, I wasn't a politician, I was just a French horn player.
But you were fond of the discoveries, and they had revealed it, and that caused some confusion.
As you can see, I was excited about capitalism. I want to tell you why.
That seems to be my constant concern. Believe it or not, in poverty.
You see, when I was young, I grew up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw a real poverty.
We were a middle-class family, but that's not a real poverty.
This is never close.
The first time I saw poverty, the face of poverty, when I was six or seven years old, the early '70s.
It was like many of you, an irregular example, a cliché.
It was a picture of a kid my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a swollen belly.
He wouldn't survive the inevitable, I was aware of that, but I couldn't do anything.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, but any picture like it.
The severe poverty around the world has been presented to the West.
Well, that vision followed me until I grew up, went to school, got out of school, came back to her and started forming my family.
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?
Or people like him around the world?
I started studying, although I wasn't in school, I was looking for the answer: what happened to the world's poorest people?
Did they get worse? Or what?
I found the answer, and I've changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
As you can see-- most Americans believe that poverty has become worse than since we were children, since they have seen that vision.
If you ask Americans, "Was the state of poverty around the world worse or better?" 70% of people will answer that hunger has worsened since early 1970.
But that's the truth.
This is the discovery that changed my mind.
Since 1970 to date, the proportion of the world &apos; s population living in hunger levels has been living on a dollar or less a day, of course, with the adjustment required to calculate inflation, which has fallen by 80 per cent.
There has been a 80% decline in the worst poverty situations in the world since I was a child.
I didn't even know that.
That, my friends, is a miracle.
This is something we should celebrate.
It is the greatest achievement against poverty in the history of humanity and has happened in our lives.
And when I found out, I wondered what we could do that?
If you don't know why? You can't do that again.
If you want to do this again and get two billion people out of poverty, that's what we've been talking about since I was a child, at least two billion of these, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want two more billion, so I wanted to know why.
I started looking for the answer.
It wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer by the left, right and center economies.
And here we are.
These are the reasons.
That's five reasons to get two billion of our brothers and sisters out of poverty since I was a kid.
I: Globalization.
II: Free trade.
III. Property rights.
IV. Rule of law.
V. Creating projects.
This was because of the world-wide free economy system after 1970.
Right now, I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprises are not perfect. I know that free enterprises are not all we need to build a better world.
But that's great.
And out of politics.
That's what I learned. That's what I found out.
Capitalism isn't just accumulation.
In its best case, it is ambitious, as many people speak on this podium, the ambition that comes from dreams and is an integral part of the free economy system.
We must share it with more people.
Now, I want to share with you a second discovery that is linked to the first discovery, which I believe will contribute to development not only around the world, but here at home.
The best thing I've heard to summarize the ideas I just said about getting people out of poverty is: "Free markets created more wealth than any system in history.
I've got billions of people out of poverty."
Who said that?
Looks like Milton Freedman or Ronald Reagan.
That's wrong.
President Barack Obama said that.
Why do I know that about a heartbeat?
Because he told me that.
Crazy.
And I said, "Hillia."
But more than that, I said, "What a chance."
You know what I was thinking?
That was during an event we were doing on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought this was the solution to the great problem America is facing today. What?
It's about these ideas, liberals and governors, to help people who need us most.
Right now, I will not have to tell anyone in this room that we are in crisis, in America and many countries around the world are related to political polarization.
It has risen to critical levels of crisis.
That's unpleasant and not true.
There was an article last year in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most outstanding newspapers published in the West.
An article published in 2014 on the inconsistency of political action.
That's what psychiatrists call a phenomenon, assuming that your faith is based on love but your opponent's faith is based on hatred.
This is common in global conflict.
This is expected to be seen between philosophers and family, for example.
What the book of this article found was in America today, most Republicans and democracies suffer from a lack of political coherence.
The majority of today &apos; s political activists in our country believe that they move out of love while the other side defends hatred.
Think about it.
Most people say, "You know, my faith is based on sympathy, I want to help people, but other people are evil and they're mine by the harvest."
You can't evolve as a society when you suffer this kind of inconsistency.
That's impossible.
How do we figure this out?
Okay, first of all, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not underestimate the differences. That would be kind of naive.
There's a lot of good research on this.
One of my old TED lecturers is my friend Jonathan Haydt.
He's a psychologist at NYU.
He's doing studies on faith, values and morals for several people to figure out how to disagree.
It has proved, for example, that governors and liberals have different significance in what they believe to be important.
For example, John Heidit has proved that liberals are more concerned with poverty than with economic freedom.
The governors are more concerned with economic freedom by 28 per cent than with poverty.
Paradox differences, right?
We will never agree. Wrong.
This is the diversity of our power.
Remember what brought the poor out of their poverty.
That obsession with poverty, linked to the way of economic freedom that spread around the world.
We need each other, or in other words, if we want to help people and get 2 billion other people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Hmm.
How do we do that?
It's interesting, isn't it?
We need creative thinking.
A lot of it on this stage.
Creating social projects. Of course.
We need to invest overseas in a sustainable, ethical and responsible manner. Yeah. Yeah.
But do you know what we really need?
We need a new day with a flexible ideology.
We should be less predictable.
Right?
Do you feel your faith is becoming predictable?
Kind of traditional?
Do you feel like you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we speak in this country about economics, on the righteous, governors, you are always talking about taxes, laws and big government.
On the left, liberals, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality.
Right? These things are important now, very important to me.
But when it comes to saving people who are starving and need us, this will distract attention from her.
We need to unite together and agree on the best ways to alleviate poverty by using the best means we have, and this can be achieved when the governors recognize their need for liberals and their poverty, and the need for Liberians to keep their heads of free trade.
This is the diversity where the future power of this country lies, if we choose it.
So how do we do it, how do we do it together?
I've got some rules of work, not just you, but me too.
First. Rule number one: Remember, it's not good enough to forgive those who disagree with you.
That's not good enough.
We must remember that we need people who are different with us, because there are people in need of all of us who are still waiting for these means.
Now, what are you gonna do, and how are you gonna say that?
Where does this start?
You know, we're all in this room now blessed.
We are blessed with the people that hear us.
We're blessed with welfare. We're blessed with leadership.
When others hear us, with this kind of unexpected ideology, people can listen.
Maybe there's progress on that point.
That's number one. Number two.
Number two: I ask you and I ask myself to be that person who goes beyond the barricades, the mystery person, which is difficult to classify.
If you're a conservative, be that conservative person who always seeks about poverty and moral duty to be a warrior of poverty.
And if you are Librelia, be liberals who always talk about the beauty of free markets to address our problems when using them responsibly.
If we do, we'll have two things.
First, we should start working on the next billions and be the solution we have seen so much in the past and need to see more in the future. That'll be it.
Secondly, we may be able to change the holy ideological war that we suffer in this country and turn it into a competition in ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then, maybe, just maybe, we'll realize that our biggest differences aren't really that different.
Thank you.
When I was in college, my specialty was in government work, which means I have to write a lot of paperwork, and I'm gonna have to do it.
Now, when any regular student writes a paper, his schedule seems almost like this...
You see... Initially, work is slow, but you're done during the first week long enough to make you see the next heavy days look productive and nice.
And I wish I could do this the same way,
That's how the plan is.
I'm gonna start writing the schedule to start working, then it's time to write, and I end up like this!
And that happens in every paper I write.
Until he asked me to write the graduation from 90 pages, a paper we're supposed to be working on all year.
And for a paper like this, my usual schedule wasn't a choice.
Because the project was too big.
I started planning the project, and I decided the schedule should look like something like this.
That's how the year goes.
I'll start with easy and light work, then I'll make a little more effort in the middle of the year, and at the end of the year, I'll do my best, it'll be so easy as to climb the stairs, a grade.
How hard can it be to climb the stairs?
It's not a big deal, is it?
But I've got something to do.
In the first months,
She came and went fast, and I couldn't do anything.
I decided to change my plan a little.
Then... but actually it's been half a year fast, and I didn't write one word, so now I'm here!
Two months down for one month and two weeks.
And one day I woke up, and there were only three days left to deliver, and I didn't write a word yet, so I did the only thing I could do, I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, and I spent two whole days without sleep, and humans shouldn't watch two days without sleep, running off to college, with slow motions, handing the paper on the exact date!
I thought I did everything.
A week later, I got a call. It was a call from college.
They asked, "Are you Tim Orben?"
I answered: "Yes."
They said, "We have to discuss with you about your thesis."
I said, "Okay."
They said, "It's the best we've ever seen in our lives."
That didn't actually happen.
It was a bad one, far from the border.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought, "This man is amazing!"
No, no, it was too bad.
Anyway, today I'm a writer and a blogger on the Internet.
I write in a code called "Wait, but why?"
Two years ago, I decided to write about the adjustment and the postponement.
My actions have always disguised the unsolved around me, and why I postpone my business, so I wanted to explain to them and the world what's going on in the heads of those who are going to spend and postpone their work, and why we are.
I had a theory that the minds of the jurors were really different from the other people.
And to test this, I found a lab that allowed me to use the magnetic resonance device to film my brain and another man's brain that doesn't delay his work so I can compare them.
And I brought the pictures with me to see them today.
Now I want you to take a good look to see if there's a difference.
I know you're not all experts, and it's not clear, but just look, okay?
So here's an undelayed brain photo,
And now...
Here's my brain photo.
There's a difference.
Both minds contain, but the solvent's mind also contains...
Now, what does that mean to the eclipse?
It means everything's fine until this happens.
The man: "This is the perfect time to do the work, the monkey will do something useful and productive, but the monkey doesn't like the plan, and he says, "Why don't we read a whole Wikipedia page on Nancy and Tonya's scandal because I just remembered that this happened?"
Then we'll go to the refrigerator, see if anything changes in her for 10 minutes.
After that, we will enter the YouTube worm that starts with videos about Richard Weinman talking about magnets and ends after a very long time watching interviews with Justin Pepper's mother.
Monkey: "All this will take time, and there's no room to do anything today.
Sorry!
Now, what's going on here?
This monkey doesn't look like someone you want, a leader behind the rudder.
He lives entirely at the moment,
He has no memory of the past, and no knowledge of the future, he cares about two things:
In the animal world, this is going perfectly.
If you're a dog, and you've done nothing but easy and fun, you're a success with all the standards!
And for monkeys, humans are just another kind of animal.
They eat, sleep and reproduce, which will be natural in the primitive times.
But if you don't notice, we're not in those times.
We're in a sophisticated, civilized time, and the monkey doesn't know what that means.
And that's why there's in our head, which gives us powers that no other animal can do.
We can imagine the future.
We can see the whole picture.
And we can make long-term plans.
The decision-maker takes all this into account,
And he wants us to just do what seems right and logical to do now.
Sometimes it seems logical and fun to do something at the same time, like having dinner or going to sleep, or enjoying leisure time.
That's why there's an overlap between logical and fun.
Sometimes they agree,
And at other times, it makes more sense to work on something difficult and not fun for the greater good.
And here comes the conflict.
For the author, this incompatibility always ends the same way, making him spend most of his time in the orange zone, a fun, easy and totally separate area from the circle of logic.
Name it.
Now, a place you all know is good.
A place where leisure time activity occurs at a time that is not really a free time.
The fun you're having isn't real fun, because it's totally undeserved, and it's all around you, full of guilt, misery, anxiety, and self-conscious, all the sweet feelings of the jurors.
And the question is, when the monkey is behind the wheel is how to move himself to the blue zone, an area where things are less fun and easy but much more important.
Well, it turns out that whoever's delaying his work has a guardian angel, a person who's always watching him, looking at him in the darkest and darkest moments, someone called...
Now he's asleep most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up, when any deadline comes too close, or there's a risk of embarrassment in front of people, losing the job, or any scary punishment.
And the most important thing is the only thing that scares the monkey.
Now, this monster has been connected to my life lately, because TED officials have contacted me six months ago and let me talk to him.
Of course I did.
I'm talking at TED in the past.
And in the middle of all this enthusiasm, the decision-maker was thinking something else.
He was saying, "Are we clear about what we just agreed?
Do we know what happens one day in the future?
We need to sit down and prepare the speech right now.
The monkey said, "I fully agree with you, but how about we open Google maps, close the picture to the bottom of India and explore it for two and a half hours until we get to the top of India, so we can educate ourselves about this country."
That's what we did that day.
It turned six months to four, then to two, and then to one month. The TED Conference decided to declare speakers to the Conference,
And when I opened the site, I found my face staring at me.
And guess who woke up?
He's starting to lose his mind, and in a few seconds, the system turns into chaos.
And the monkey-- remember, the monkey's scared of the horror monster and went up to the tree!
And finally, he got the rudder, and I could start working on the lecture.
Now it's all sorts of crazy behavior at the jurors, like how I could spend two weeks all sorts of behavior on writing one sentence in my thesis, and then, in a nutshell, words come on in two days to write eight pages.
This whole situation with the three characters, this is the masculinity system.
Not beautiful, but in the end, it works.
And that's what I decided to write on the code two years ago.
And when I wrote, I got the answers,
Thousands of letters have arrived, from all kinds of people, from all over the world, working all kinds of jobs.
They were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, lots of doctoral students,
And they all said, "I have the same problem."
What surprised me was the discrepancy between the invisibility of the speech I wrote and the weight of these letters,
These people have been writing with great frustration about what this monkey did to them in their lives.
And when I thought about it, I said, "If the settlement system works, what's going on?"
Why are these people so frustrated?
Turns out there are two kinds of adjustments,
Everything I talked about today, all the examples, has a deadline.
When there are deadlines, the effect of the postponement is contained and pressed in the short term to intervene.
But there's another kind of postponement, a kind that happens in circumstances that have no deadline.
Like, if you want to start a free business, something in the art, or a pioneering job, these jobs don't have deadlines at first, because nothing really happened when you came out and started working hard to get some work to do other jobs.
There's also a lot of important work out of your business, and it doesn't include deadlines, like visiting your parents or sports, taking care of your health, working to develop your relationships, or cutting off bad relationships.
Now, if the only way to solve these difficult things is by, there's a problem, because in all these important actions that don't contain the monster's deadlines, it won't appear.
There's no date for him to wake up, so the delayed effect won't be contained, so this business will continue and extend forever.
And this is the kind of long-term adjustment that is not seen and much of a talk about, like the first type: fun, short-range and time-consuming.
Normally, people have type two, quietly and privately.
And this adjustment could be a major source of long-term sadness and regret.
I thought, "That's why these people text me, and that's why they're in such a bad situation.
Not because they're targeting a particular project,
It's because of that long-term postponement that made them as spectators, sometimes for their own lives.
Their frustration doesn't come from not realizing their dreams, but because they couldn't pursue them in the first place.
While I read the letters, I had some kind of inspiration:
That's right.
Of course, you may not be as messy as each other, and some of you may have a good relationship with the dates, but remember, the secret monkey trick is when there's no deadline.
Now, I want to show you something.
My name is:
Every box represents a week in 90 years' lives,
It doesn't seem like there's a lot of them, especially since we used a lot of them before.
I think we all need to take a deep look at this table.
And we have to think about what we're actually delaying, because each of us has something to postpone in his life.
We need to keep an eye on the occasional monkey.
This is a job for all of us.
And because there's not that many boxes in the table, that's a job you should start from today.
Um, maybe not today, but...
You know,
Soon...
Thanks.
We were there, spirits and overcrowded bodies in Texas last night of our lives.
They're locked in a room like this, but with annoying wooden seats covered with red cloth, with Argen on my left, Coral from behind, and a baptism basin lying in the wall behind.
A room like this, but...
With the same strong feeling of confusion, the same deep hope of salvation, the same race in the hands and the same people who do not listen in the back.
This was December 31 of 1999, the night of the second arrival of Jesus, and the end of the world as I know it.
That year it was 12 and reached the age of accountability.
As soon as I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would come back again as soon as I became responsible for everything I had done, I decided that it would be better for me to solve my problems with the end of the speed.
That's why I went to church as much as I could.
Listen to the scone with the same flare that someone might listen to, trying to make sure that God didn't trick me, and I decided to come back early.
And if he did, I'd have prepared an alternate plan, reading the Turks Behind series, which was the last fashion advice at the time.
And I found among her pages that if I didn't get ecstasy at midnight, I could try another.
All I had to do was avoid being labeled by the monster, fighting demons, buoys and the enemy of Jesus himself.
It'll be hard-- but I know I can do it.
Now the planning time is over.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We have ten minutes left, and we've called a priest from the seats and even the altar because he wanted to pray when midnight.
That's why every caste took its place.
The Coral stayed in his platform, the sanctuary and their wives -- or baptized bourgeois, and I like to invite them -- occupied the first place in front of the altar.
You see, in America, until the second arrival of Jesus has a VIP section.
Behind the completely baptized bourgeois, the elderly -- men and women whose young backs were burned under the incendiary stain of the cotton fields east of Texas, whose skin was squeezed -- by burning -- with noble brown, just like East Texas, whose hopes and dreams were broken for what life could become even more out of East Texas.
Yeah, for me these guys and women were show stars.
They've waited their entire lives for that moment, just as their ancestors lived from the middle ages to the end of the world, and just as my grandmother was waiting for the Oprah Winfrey programme on Channel 8 every day at 4:00.
And like she made her way to the altar, she snuck right behind her, because I certainly knew my grandmother would go to heaven.
And I thought if I held her hand during this prayer, I might go in the right direction with her.
That's why I grabbed and closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
The voice of prayers has become higher.
Responses to the prayer appeal continue to rise more.
The Argen continued to add the funeral pedagogy.
He came free to add sweat.
And I kept my hands tighter, so I wouldn't be the one left in the open.
I close my eyes so I can't see the body being separated from the fat.
And then the sound over us: "Amen."
It's over.
I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked at the older believers who did not come faithful, who were so proud to show any hope of disappointment, who had so much faith and a long time now to start doubting.
But I was upset instead of them.
They've been tricked, cheated, misled, and I slept with them all the time.
I prayed for their prayers. I went away from every temptation as much as I could.
I swept my head not once, but twice in the baptism pond that drives over.
I believed.
Now what?
I've come home in time to open the TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium as it has been around the world.
It turns out that it would be odd anyway that Jesus would come back once and again depending on the different time zones.
And that made me feel silly -- hurt more, really.
That night, I didn't stop believing.
But I believed in something new:
The answers I had may have been wrong, that the same questions were wrong.
Now, once there was a mountain of certainty, there was a spring of doubt running towards its base, a promising spring in the rivers.
I can track all the drama in my life since that night in the church when my faithful didn't come, when it turns out that the thing I believed in with certainty, if not a lie, is at least not the truth.
Although most of you have prepared the new millennium in a completely different manner, I am confident that you are here because some of you have done the same thing since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left my father and my God refused to come.
I slid my hand, looking for something I believe in.
When I arrived at Yale University at 18, I remained confident that my trip from Ok Liv Texas was an opportunity to leave behind all the challenges I had, the shattered dreams and the defeated bodies I saw.
But when I found myself on one of the winter holidays in my city lying on my face, my hands tied behind my back and the thief gun pointed at my head, I understood that even the best education could not save me.
I stood up when I came as an intern at Leman Brothers Bank in 2008.
Hopefully, I even called home to tell my family that we're not going to be poor again.
But I witnessed the collapse of this temple of money in front of my eyes, I understood that even the best job she couldn't save me.
I stood up when I came to Washington as a young employee, heard a voice from Illinois calling, saying, "It's been a long time, but in these elections, there's a change in America."
But since Congress has stopped and the State has collapsed and hope and change as a cruel joke, I understand that even the second political coming can't save me.
I stood faithfully in front of the altar of the American dream, beginning to the gods of my time with success, money and power.
But once and again, it's midnight, and open my eyes to find that all those gods are dead.
And from that cemetery, I started looking again, not because I was brave, but because I understood that I either believe or die.
That's why I went to the pilgrims but to another place other than the Harvard School of Business, knowing this time that I would not be able to accept the salvation he claims to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work.
He started working from a dark spot at an overcrowded party, a late night from the start of the miserable Cambridge winter when I asked three friends a question asked by the guys looking for something real for a long time: what if we went on a drive?
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we should do it.
Because like Jack Kirk wrote all our lives, we've been dying to sneak in the night and disappear somewhere, and go find out what people do all over the country.
Therefore, although there were other voices, she said that risk was too big, and success was uncertain, we went anyway.
In the summer of 2013, we cut 8,000 miles across America, between the cow pastures in Montana, Detroit and the New Orleans swamps, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses where the impact was the point.
As we are trained at the Military Academy of Capital, we were surprised by that revolutionary idea.
This idea has spread, and it has become a non-profit organization called MAES across America, which has made me stand here on this rostrum.
We've spread because we found a great expectation of our generation to find a purpose and meaning.
It spread because we found an infinite number of business leaders in the dark corners of America who were creating jobs, changing lives and needing little help.
But to be honest, I spread because I fought to spread.
There were no limits that I could stand to promise this Bible, and to make more people believe that we can join the wounds of a broken state, one social project every time.
But that missionary trip led me to the completely different Bible that I came to share with you today.
It started a year ago, almost at the New York Natural History Museum, at the Harvard Business School graduates.
Under a full-grown version of the whale, I sat with our time giants, where they were celebrating their fellowship and good work.
There was a sense of pride where capital and assets under management exceeded half a trillion dollars.
We reviewed everything we did, and it was good.
But two days later, I had to travel north to Harlem, where I found myself sitting on an urban farm that once was a free land day, listening to a man named Tony telling me about the children who come there every day.
They all live below the poverty line.
Many of them carry all their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in the homeless shelter.
Some of them came to Tony's show, called Harlem developing, to get their only meal every day.
Tony told me that Harlem developing started out of his retirement money, after he worked as a taxi driver for 20 years.
He told me he didn't give himself a salary, because despite his success, the program still has a lack of resources.
He told me he might take any help he could get.
I was there as such.
But once I left Tony, I felt the fire and the salt of tears falling out of my eyes.
I felt the inspiration that one night I could sit in one room, with a few hundred people with half a trillion, and then two days later, in another room, 50 blocks north, where a man who's not paid to save her single meal a day.
It wasn't gross inequality that made me cry, and it wasn't the idea of hunger, and homeless children, it wasn't one-per-cent anger or pity about 99.
No, I was confused because I finally realized that I was a kidney wash for a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I have realized that my story is about all those who are expected to solve their own problems even if they have nothing to do with it; my organization calls for all the structural and systemic assistance that has never arrived in Harlem, Apaches or the ninth basement; my voice depicts all those sounding illiterate, dirty, unprepared.
And shameful of it, that shame has betrayed me like a shame to sit in front of TV, watching Peter Jennings announce the beginning of the new millennium again, again and again.
I was deceived, misguided.
But this time, I was a false faithful.
As you can see, I have come a long way from that altar the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people speak in an inspiring language and see suffering as an inevitable God law, and they have taken a text as an inaccurate fact.
Yeah, I've gotten a lot better that I'm back to where I started.
Because it's simply not true to say that we live in the era of unity-- no, we believe today just like ever.
Some of us may believe in the Brennan or Tony Robbins.
We may believe in New Yorker as a holy book or Harvard Pines Reveaux.
We may even feel deeper faith when we worship here in the Church of TED, but we strongly want to believe, we need to believe.
We're talking in the language of attractive, influential leaders that promise us to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as an inevitable capitalist law. That is our God. We accept the text of technological progress as an incorrect reality.
We are rarely aware of the human price we pay when we fail to question one step, because we fear that this will undermine our entire institution.
But if you're confused by the unreasonable things we have to accept, then it must be a time of accountability.
So I don't have the Bible of Trouble or Renovation or TBL.
Today I don't have the Bible of faith to share with you.
In fact, what I have and what I offer is the Bible of Doubt.
The Bible of Doubt does not ask you to stop believing, but asks you to believe in something new:
It's possible that the answers we have are wrong that the same questions could be wrong.
Yeah, the Bible of Doubt means we could be on this stage, in this room, wrong.
Because it raises a question of why?
With all the power in our hands, why are humans still suffering so hard?
This suspicion led me to share, so we put our MBS across America out of business.
We have separated the staff, closed our doors, and we will share our model free of charge with anyone who thinks he can do this without waiting for our consent.
This doubt forced me to give up the loyal role that some have given me, because our time is too short and our chances are too far away to wait for her second, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
This suspicion, fuels and gives me hope that when our problems are overwhelmed, when the paths are revealed to us and they seem to lead us to death, when our healers do not offer any comfort to our wounds, our blind faith will not be... our humble doubt will be to shed some light on the darkness of our lives and our world and allow us to raise our voice to whisper.
Or to scream or simply say, "There must be another way."
Thanks.
Food crisis.
News on the news every day.
But what is it?
Food shortages in some regions of the world, or it could be a lot.
In other regions, genetically modified foods save the world.
Could be the amended food?
A lot of waste dumping at sea creates bad oceans and toxic oceans, weakening nutrition.
It never goes on like this.
And I see the current climate of this debate is terriblely unbuilt.
So how do we get this close to something we can understand?
How is this apple a food crisis?
You've all had an apple last week.
How old do you think this apple has been since the moment I popped it?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months -- average apple age in a grocery in the United States.
I do not expect the average to be very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
Their coating, we put them in cold tanks and then we fill the tanks with gas-- there's actually documented evidence of cases where workers tried to get into these environments to retrieve an apple, and they died, because of the inner air used to slow the apple process causing human poisoning.
How did none of you ever know that?
Why didn't I know that before?
Ninety percent of the quality of that apple-- all antioxidation-- is still at the time we get it.
It's actually just a sugar ball.
How did we get so low and how can we get better?
I think what we're missing is a program.
I know programs-- I know computers, they got me online when I was little.
I did very strange work-- on this program.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a spear, we could feel paid to ask:
To me, I asked, what if the climate is democratic?
This is a weather map for the world.
More green, less red-produced areas.
They exchange and change, and farmers from California now become Mexican farmers.
China takes land from the wilderness to grow better food, and we're climate slaves.
What if every country has its productive climate?
What's that gonna change the way we live?
What's that gonna change with the quality of life and food?
The problem of the former generation was, we need more food and we need to be cheap.
Welcome to your world farm.
We built a giant model for a farm.
All these tracks-- car tracks, planes, trains and wheels.
It's a miracle we feed 7 billion people even though a few of us are involved in food production.
What if...
We built a digital farm?
Global digital farm.
What if you can take this apple, number it somehow, send it through molecules in the air, regroup it on the other end?
What if?
I'll read a stick of these words. They inspired me to do what I do.
First, Japanese agriculture has no youth, no water, no land, no future. That's what I landed on the day I visited Minamisanki in southern Fukushima, after the disaster.
Children headed towards Sanday and Tokyo. Earth is contaminated, they import 70 percent of their food.
But this is not unique to Japan.
Two percent of Americans are involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from two percent of the population of any country?
When we roam around the world, 50% of Africa's population is under 18.
80 percent don't want to be farmers.
Agriculture is hard.
The life of a small stockholder.
They go to town.
In India: Farmers &apos; families are unable to access basic services. This year more than the previous 10 farmers have committed suicide.
It's uncomfortable talking about this.
Where are they going?
To the city.
No guys, everyone's headed there.
How do we build this program that inspires young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my collection.
In previous years, I went to Bath's hand, Pyund and Hom Depot, and I started to confuse.
I built petty things and made plants dance, and I got them with my computer, and I killed them all-- a lot.
In the end, I made them survive.
And I made one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had, because I was learning plant language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They say, "Do this, boy!"
This is an old unwanted electronic room.
What can you do?
My team and I built a farm inside the media lab, an unknown place across history, anything about biology, but everything about virtual life.
Within these 60 square feet we've produced enough food to feed 300 people once a month-- not much food.
And there's a lot of hot technology there.
But the most exciting thing?
Beautiful white roots, deep green colors and a monthly harvest.
Is that the new cafeteria?
Is this new retail experience?
Is this the new grocery store?
I can say one thing for sure: this is the first time someone in the media lab took root for anything.
We get power with bags; nothing's wrong with this.
But what happens when you have an art therapist built on pictures, a data world, taking roots and thinking, "H." I know something about-- I can do this. I want to try.
In this process, we'll get the plants out and we'll take some of them to the lab, because when you plant them and raise them, don't throw them away, they're kind of valuable to you.
I have this weird tongue right now, because I'm afraid to let anyone eat anything before I eat it first, because I want it to be good.
So eat the lettuce every day and I can figure out the lettuce to ten.
I say, "No, this is 6.1-- no, no, you can't eat this day."
The loser that day was so sweet.
She was very sweet because the plant was exhausted and created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I won't die!"
And the plant that won't die tastes sweet to me.
The technology went backwards in vegetation.
We thought other people needed to try this.
We wanted to see what people could make, so we imagined a lab we could ship anywhere.
Then we made it.
So in the front of the medical lab comes my lab, which contains 30 spots for every plant.
If you know about genome or genetics, that's the phenomenon, right?
The phenomenon.
When you say, "I love strawberries from Mexico," you really like strawberries from the climate that produced the phrase you love.
So, if you're programming a climate like carbon dioxide and oxygen that creates a recipe-- you programmed it for this plant, food for this plant, the size of this plant, its shape, its colour, its touch.
We need data. So we put a bunch of sensitivities there to show us what's going on.
If you think about your plants, you look at them and you're so miserable because you tell him, "Why do you die?" You don't want to talk to me?
Farmers have developed the most beautiful eyes for resurrection when they're at the end of 60 and 70 years old.
They can tell you when you see the plant die from nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency or need more humidity.
These beautiful eyes don't move in the heirs.
These eyes are in the default plantation cloud.
We extend these data points over time.
We link these data points to single plants.
These are the broccoli in my lab that day, via the IP address.
We have Brooklyn. She has an Internet protocol address.
If that's not weird enough, you can push one and get a personal plant file. - What?
And this teaches you how to develop a decomposable plant, but not what you think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does he get to the food I need?
When does the bait I want?
Does he get too much water?
Does he get a lot of sun?
Warnings.
He can talk to me. He's a speaker. We have a language.
I think that's the first user on vegetation, right?
This is the information of this plant and this plant will start with the addition of friends of God.
And I mean it-- it'll add friends from other plants that use less nitrogen or more phosphorus, less potassium.
We'll learn about complications. We're still guessing each other now.
And you may not agree to our friendship -- I don't know, and you may agree to ask for our friendship, depending on our actions.
Well, this is my lab.
He's a little better organized, and my experience comes from designing hospital data centres for everything, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
So... inside this environment, we run tests of all kinds of things. - What?
And this operation, aquaculture, was developed from the Mir Space Station to reduce the amount of water to space.
This process operates on the basis of giving the plant exactly what it needs: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots aren't that complicated, so once you give them that, you get this amazing expression.
And it's like a plant has two hearts.
And because he has two hearts, he grows four or five times faster.
It's a whole world.
We went away on the technology road and a seed of a negative world, and we will continue to do so, but we will have a new tool, too, which is an integrated world.
Well, we planted all kinds of things.
These tomatoes have not been produced commercially in 150 years.
You know we have stores for rare and old seeds?
Banks or seed banks.
Amazing.
She has living assets and things you've never eaten.
And I'm the only one in this room that ate this kind of tomato.
And the problem is that it was a tomato paste that we don't know how to cook, so we ate tomato pastures and it wasn't so delicious.
We did a lot of protein. We raised all kinds of things.
We raised even humans, well, you might, but we didn't.
But what we confirmed was that the device was too big and too expensive. - What?
And you started distributing it around the world and it was worth about $100,000.
And to find someone with $100,000 in his back pocket is not easy, so we wanted another little job.
This project was actually one of my students -- a mechanical engineer named Camille.
Camille, me and my team, we moved through the whole summer, how we make it cheaper, how we make it better, how we make it so that others can make it.
Then we distributed it to schools between seventh and eleventh grades.
And if you really want to humiliate, try to teach a child something.
And that's how I got into that school and I said, "Get him on a 65% humidity."
One of the seventh-grade students said, "What's the humidity?"
And I said, "Hey, it's the water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you idiot"?
I said like, "Well, don't trust me."
Actually-- don't trust me, do you?
Put it on 100.
So he put it on 100, so what happened?
Started to intensify, made a fog, then started to squeeze.
He said, "Oh." Wetness is rain.
Why didn't you just tell me that?
We've prepared a connection to this much like the game.
They have a three-dimensional environment that they can enter from anywhere in the world on their smartphones or small computers.
They have different parts of the natural, sensitive.
They choose prescriptions created by other children anywhere in the world.
They pick the recipe, they play it, they grow a seed.
And while they grow, they make changes?
They say, "Why does a plant need carbon dioxide?
Isn't it bad?
If we increase the gas, the plant dies.
And if we lower it, the plant grows well.
The plant counts, they created a new digital recipe.
It's an interactive design and development and an exploration process.
And then they can save it, and all the data about the new plant they developed or the new digital recipe, and what you did -- were it better or worse?
Imagine this as a small process hub.
We'll learn too much.
And this is one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school three weeks later.
These are three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it's the first time this boy thinks of becoming a farmer -- or he'll want to be a farmer.
That's why we opened all this to the public.
He's online. Go home and try to build your first food computer.
That would be hard-- that's what I'm telling you.
We're at first, but everything is there.
It's important to me that access is easy.
And we'll keep trying to make it easier.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer world, plant world, economic, city planner.
They work on a single basis what they do.
But we grew a little more.
This is my facility that I just started working out.
Could be the warehouse anywhere.
That's why I chose him.
And inside this warehouse, we'll build something like this.
She's here now.
Look at her.
It already exists too.
Someone raises vegetables, and another raises an Ebola vaccine.
It's great that these plants and the winner of the Grand Advanced Defence Research Agency award are one of the reasons for our progress on Aybola.
Plants produce a protein resistant to Ebola.
So are the hunters and the food specialists, down to the lettuce.
But these two things don't look like each other, and here I am with my field.
Everything's different.
We've reached the strange "everything's good" case, and she's like, "This is my black box--" and "no, they bought my box."
"No, no, no-- I have very valuable intellectual property rights.
Buy my box, not his box."
The truth is, we're still at first, at a time when society moves as well.
When we order more cheap food, we don't order greener food.
And when McDonald announces what's in the chicken balls, the strangest food in all times -- and they build their marketing plan on it -- everything changes.
Now let's get into the world.
Private food computers, caterers and food data centres operate on an open phenomenon.
Think of an open genetic map, but we're going to put on little climatic recipes, like Wikipedia, which can be paged, occupied and developed.
What's that like in the world?
Remember the world is connected to strings?
We're starting to find the lighthouses.
We started sending information about food, instead of sending food.
That's not my imagination. That's what we're actually spreading.
Computers for food and food servers, and soon food data centers, connect people together to share information.
The future of food is not fighting for what is bad about this.
We know what's wrong with this.
The future of food is about connecting the next billion farmers to a base to ask and answer a question, "What if?"
Thank you.
There are times when I really feel ashamed to be European.
Last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response was, frankly, pathetic.
There's a lot of contradictions,
They were deeply saddened by the tragic death of the two-year Kurdish child, and since then more than 200 children subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties recognizing that refugees are a shared responsibility, but we accepted that little Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe.
We regret the existence of human smugglers, but we have made it the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We have a lack of employment, but we have excluded these people to whom our economic and demographic needs apply from coming to Europe.
We welcome the liberal values that we have in opposition to fanatic Islam, but -- we have oppressive policies that impede asylum-seekers, differentiate children and their families, and hold refugee property.
What do we do?
How did it get so far, to adopt this inhuman policy to confront this humanitarian crisis?
I don't think that's why people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it.
But I believe that the reason for this is that our foundation lacks vision, a vision of how an international refugee regime was built more than 50 years ago for the changing and globalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step backwards and ask two fundamental questions, we all need to ask two questions.
First question, why doesn't the current system work?
And secondly, what can we do to fix this system?
The modern refugee system was established following the Second World War by these men.
Its primary objective is to ensure that when a State fails, or worse happens, the regime turns against its people, people find a place to go, live safely and dignified so that they can return home.
I have been created specifically for situations such as the one we see in Syria today,
Through an international convention signed by 147 Governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the International Commission, States must reciprocate the people on their territory fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, however, our migration policies are based on breaking the road to safety.
In theory, the coming is entitled to be merged into society, or to be returned to the country from which it came.
But in fact, their fate remains to be forgotten indefinitely.
In theory, the refugee issue is a shared global responsibility.
But in practice, geography means that States close to conflict take the vast majority of refugees in the world.
This system has not been broken because its rules are wrong.
We have not applied it adequately in this changing world, which we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit how the current system works.
How does the refugee system work?
But not from the top to the bottom from the institutional perspective, rather than from the perspective of refugees.
So imagine a Syrian woman.
And let's call it a princess.
A princess to me represents a lot of people I met in the area.
A princess, representing about 25 per cent of the world &apos; s refugees, a woman with children, and she can't go home because she came from this city that you see before you, which is a toast, the city that was once beautiful and historic and now under the rubble.
And so a princess can't go there.
Nor does it have any hope of resettlement in a third country, as this is a lottery ticket available only to less than one percent of the world &apos; s refugees.
A princess and her family therefore face a near impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that a princess can take her family to the camp,
That you could get help, but there are very few expectations in front of a princess and her family.
Camps are in dark, arid places, often in the desert.
In the Al-Zatri camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of missiles across the border at night in Syria.
There is a restricted economic activity.
Education is often of poor quality.
About 80 per cent of the refugees living in camps must remain in the world for at least five years.
It's a miserable life, and that's probably why, in fact, only nine percent of Syrians resorted to this option.
Instead, a princess can go to urban areas to neighbouring cities, such as Amman or Beirut.
That option was taken by about 75 per cent of Syrian refugees.
But there's a lot of difficulty, too.
Refugees in these urban areas often have no right to work,
And they can't usually get help.
Therefore, when a princess and her family used their basic savings, they are likely to face poverty in urban areas.
So there's a third alternative for them, which is why our refugee population has increased.
The princess can seek some hope for her family to risk their lives on a dangerous journey to another State, which we are witnessing in Europe today.
Throughout the world, we are often faced with refugees who do not have another choice among the three options: camp, poverty in neighbouring urban areas or a risky journey.
For refugees, this option is the global refugee system today.
But I think it's a wrong choice.
And that we can reconsider this choice.
The reason for reducing these options is because we believe that these are the only options available to refugees, and there are only options.
The politicians have framed the case as a zero-sum case, so that if we benefit from the refugees, we will charge the citizens.
We tend to assume collectively that refugees are an inevitable cost or a burden on society.
But that's not necessarily what they can do.
What I would like to say is that we can broaden those options so that they can benefit all: host States and communities, our communities and refugees themselves.
So I would like to suggest four ways in which we can change our way of thinking about the refugee issue.
All these four methods have a common denominator: they are the same paths that have led us to globalization, mobility and markets, and modernizing the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first way I would like to think about is the idea of enabling environments, which begin with a fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like anyone else, but only in exceptional circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, I launched a research project in Uganda on the economic life of refugees.
We have chosen Uganda not because it is representative of all host countries.
It's not. It's because it's extraordinary.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is to give refugees economic opportunities,
She gave them the right to work and freedom of movement,
The consequences are unusual for both refugees and host communities.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21 per cent of the refugees have businesses employing other persons, and 40 per cent of these employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees create jobs for citizens in the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional examples of prosperous and vibrant pioneers,
For example, in a settlement called Nakaval, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music companies.
We found Rwandans who run the available businesses that allow young people to play computer games from TVs and recycled games.
Unlike the restrictions imposed on them elsewhere, the refugees are inventing, and the man you see before you is a Congolese named Dimo-Kay.
Demo-Kay arrived at this settlement with so little, but he wanted to be a director.
He started at a local radio station, with a bunch of friends and colleagues, renting a video camera, and now he's a movie maker, and he's a big fan.
He provided two documentary films with our team and managed to establish a very little business.
It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities to flourish humans.
Yeah, clothes, blankets, shelter and food are all important in the emergency phase, but we also have to look further.
We need access and electricity, education, right to work, access to capital and banking services.
All the ways we take to reach the global economy can and must apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all the host countries in the world have exercised the same paths as our own.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still alternative realistic options that we can use.
Last April, I travelled to Jordan with my colleague, along with the development economist Paul Collier, and in our mind I thought, as we were there with the international community and the Government, an idea of offering employment to Syrians by supporting the Jordanian national development strategy.
The idea is an economic zone, through which we can strongly integrate refugees into work together with the employment of Jordanian host citizens.
And only 15 minutes from Al-Zatri camp, there is a home for 83,000 refugees, the current economic zone called King Hussein Bin Talal Development Park.
The Government spent more than $100 million in connection with the electricity and road network, but lacked two orders: access to work and internal investment.
What if the refugees were able to work there instead of being stuck in camps, they would be able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they returned to Syria?
We recognize that Jordan can take advantage of this, which requires its development strategy to create a shift and a qualitative leap from a middle-income State to a industrialized State,
Refugees can benefit, but can also contribute to the post-conflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to embrace refugees as the ultimate best source for the reconstruction of Syria.
We published the idea in Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah took this idea,
It was announced in London at the Syria conference two weeks ago and will begin in the coming summer.
The third idea that I want to put in your hands is the homogeneous preference between States and refugees to achieve happy results, as you see here in the personal images of Angela Mercel and Syrian refugees.
What we rarely did was ask the refugees what they wanted, and where they wanted to go, but what I care to say is that we can do it and make everyone better.
Economic expert Alvin Ruth has developed the notion of homogeneous markets, in ways that the order of preference for the parties constitutes a final homogeneity.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Tettleboim have devised ways to apply that idea to refugees by asking refugees where they prefer, but also allowing States to classify the types of refugees they wish to host based on skill standards or language standards and to allow them to engage.
Now, of course, I needed to build quotas such as diversity and vulnerability, but it's the way to increase integration.
The idea of integration has been used successfully, for example, to enrol students in universities, to engage volunteers in patients, and lies behind the algorithms on the knowledge sites.
Why don't we apply the idea of giving refugees more options?
It can also be used at the national level. As one of the major challenges we face is to convince local communities to accept refugees,
At present, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to the cities of rural areas and farmers, which is absolutely irrelevant.
Harmonization of markets thus provides a potential means of achieving these preferences together and listening to the needs and demands of the regular population and the refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put in your hands is human visas.
A lot of tragedies and chaos we saw in Europe could have been completely avoided.
It is based on the fundamental contradiction in Europe &apos; s asylum policy, which is: in order to obtain asylum in Europe, you have to come spontaneously through those dangerous journeys that you have as your own.
But why should such dangerous flights be necessary in the age of economic aviation companies and modern embassies?
It is absolutely unnecessary and last year has led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people across Europe and within European territory.
If refugees are simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we will avoid it, and there is a way to do so through a so-called humanitarian visa, which allows people to obtain a visa in a neighbouring embassy or consulate where they simply pay for their journey through ships or flight to Europe.
About 1,000 euros is the cost of smuggling from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It costs 200 euros to travel economic planes from Podrum to Frankfurt.
If we let the refugees do this, it'll have big answers.
You will save lives, we will cut the road on the smuggling market completely and remove the chaos we see on the front line of Europe in areas such as the Greek Islands.
It's a policy that prevents us from doing this instead of a rational solution,
And this idea has been applied,
Brazil has relied on a pioneering method, as more than 2,000 Syrians have been able to obtain humanitarian visas, and when they enter Brazil they have a description of the coming.
Every Syrian has refugee status and has been recognized as a real refugee.
And there's another historical precedent, too.
Between 1922 and 1942, these passports were used as travel documents to allow the transfer of 45,000 Armenians, Chechnya and Turks to travel across Europe and to obtain a refugee recipe elsewhere in Europe.
The International Office for Refugees received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this applicable strategy.
So all the four ideas I've given you are a way through which we can expand Princess' options,
It is ways in which we can get great options for refugees away from the three basic options that are impossible.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, seeing the expansion of refugee options, but they realize they shouldn't be a burden.
There's nothing inevitable about the cost of refugees.
Yeah, it's a humanitarian and responsible issue, but they're humans with skills, talents and ambitions, and they have the capacity to contribute... if we let them.
In the new world, migration is not on its way.
What we saw in Europe will be present with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, and they will continue to be displaced from their homelands, so we need to find a realistic and rational way to manage this... not based on the old logic of humanitarian assistance, not on the logic of charitable work, but on building the opportunities offered by mobility and globalized markets,
I assure you that we must awaken from our omission and urge politicians to wake up to meet this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a little kid, I always dreamed about the ocean.
It was that colorful, innocent place of life, home to those imaginary alien creatures.
I've filmed large sharks dominated the food chain and I've seen sea turtles dance around coral reefs.
As a marine biology specialist, I spent most of my career looking for magical places like those I dreamed of when I was young.
As you can see, I'm starting to discover sea surfaces at a relatively early age.
But the first time I sunk in the water, I was 10 years old.
And I still remember very well when I was swimming so hard to get to that old cannon with shallow coral reefs.
And when I finally got to him, I looked up, I was surrounded by fish all over the rainbow colors.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Pishak is a topographic photographer of the 40s of my life on this planet, and I have the opportunity to find out some of the spectacular sea scenes of the National Geographic Magazine and our founder.
I've filmed everything from big sharks to those little ones that fit my palm.
I inhaled the disgraceful smell of the mourning whales that were feeding away from me by the cold seas in Canada by combing the rainforest of the great bear."
And I've been familiar with the rite of mating for the sea turtles of the Musbeg Strait.
Everyone on this planet is affected and affected by the ocean.
The long and clean seas I dreamed of as a child have become very difficult to find.
The seas are getting more pressure and more threatening.
As humans, we continue to maintain our role as a prey on the ground. I have seen and photographed many of these direct effects.
For a long time, I thought I'd hit my audience with their pains through some disturbing images.
Although this approach has advantages, I first came back.
I believe the best way to change is to sell love.
I think I'm kind of playing "talker" and as a photograph, I have a rare opportunity to detect the entire animals and ecosystems that lie beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can't fall in love with something and become a hero if you don't know it exists.
By revealing this-- this is the power of photography for the governor.
I've visited hundreds of marine sites, but only a few marine sights have sharpened my attention and have a profound effect.
The first time I tested that height was about 10 years ago, off the coast of South Africa, the light and the wild.
In June and July, massive sardines travel to the north in a mass exodus of what we call Sardin escape.
And those fish have a good reason to escape.
Where they're being chased by predators and sprinklers.
Dolphins hunt in a common way and can disperse a sardine to create small and tempting fish.
You draw fish to the surface of the ocean and then rush to dinner to celebrate.
The sharks are believed to be behind it.
Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are deadly enemies, but during Sardin escape, they actually coexist.
Actually, dolphins help sharks to feed effectively.
Without the help of the dolphins, the food balls are more common, and it often ends with sharks by eating so-called sardines, or with a mouth full of water.
Right now, after I had hot moments with sharks during Sardin escape, I knew she wouldn't see me as a prey.
However, I'm being slapped as any other guest during this very loud feast.
From the shores of Africa, let us travel to the East, where the vast Indian Ocean to the Maldiv Islands, archipelago from the atolls.
During the stormy south-west seasonal winds, sea demons travel across the archipelago to a small spot in Ba Atul called Hapiro.
Large collections of crusts, most of which are no more than eye irritation, are the basic food of sea demon fish.
When the amount of bee plants becomes small, the sea demons feed on their own and overwhelm around themselves, like a small puppy chases his tail.
While, when the amount of vegetation rises, the fish of sea demons are caught behind each other to be a long food chain, and if the first fish can't eat food, it will, of course, be taken by the next fish.
The lower the volumes of algae in the Gulf, the closer the fish of sea demons to each other, a unique behaviour called hurricane feeding.
Since they are in tight form, this group of sea demons creates some sort of hurricane, so algae absorbs and brings them to their mouths.
The diving experience of hundreds of sea demons is indeed a unique and unforgettable experience.
When I first photographed Hanifaro, this area was not protected and was threatened by development.
Working with non-governmental organizations such as Manta Trast, my image certainly helped to become the Hanifaru area protected.
Currently, fishermen from nearby islands have once fished sea demons to make traditional urine from the skin of these fish.
Today, they are one of the most enthusiastic governors and the Maldivian economy earns over $8 million each year.
I always wanted to go back in a time when maps were mostly empty or read, "There's dragons."
Today, the closest place I visited is the remote islands in the western Indian Ocean.
Away from sea navigation corridors and fishing fleets, diving in these waters is an emotional reminder of what our oceans once were.
A few people have heard of Bassas da Anda, a little bit of coral in Mozbek.
It's a coral people representing an outdoor barrier and the inner lake is a nursery place for Galapagos sharks.
Those sharks were shy even during the day.
I had a feeling they'd be bolder and raise their numbers at night.
I've never encountered so many sharks on coral receptacles.
It reminds me why I chose this way.
Sometime this year, I was on a mission to the National Geographic magazine in Baja California.
About halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side is San Ignacio Lajon, a place of gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast has witnessed a massacre, where more than 2,000 grey whales have been killed and only a few hundred survivors remain.
Today the grandchildren of the same whales push their young children to the surface to play and even interact with us.
These species have really seen a remarkable return.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula, Cabo Belmo, a quiet fishing island.
Contracts of random fishing caused the collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the authorities to declare their waters as a marine reserve.
But what happened next was at least a miracle.
In 2005, only a decade after protection, scientists measured the extent to which fish were recovered.
But don't hear a word from me-- come with me.
Just the same, they dive with me deep down, one of the biggest places to be the fish I've ever encountered.
We all have the ability to create some kind of hope.
By filming, I want to publish a message: it's not too late to protect our oceans.
I want to focus, in particular, on the flexibility and ease of adapting nature to face 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will look more and more to do such images and create images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
And I hope it's a daily event for me.
To flourish and survive in my profession, you must truly be hopeful.
It should always work on the assumption that the magnificent image of change is only very close, behind the next coral, inside the next lake or perhaps in the next lake.
When she moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was the foundation of the national health policy in Zimbabwe.
The new Government was sent after a long war of independence and immediately announced a social programme: both health-care services and primary education were free of charge.
The rural health centres were widely deployed, with nearly 80% of the population having access to those services in less than two hours on foot, a huge achievement of its kind.
In 1980, in independence, about 25% of the children in Zimbabwe were vaccinated.
By 1990, only a decade later, this proportion was 80%.
I felt so proud to be part of this transformation, this revolution.
That sense of excitement and friendship was obvious.
Working side by side with my smart fellow citizens -- scientists, doctors and activists -- I felt that I belonged not only to the African independence movement, but also to the public health movement in progress.
But there were enormous challenges.
Zimbabwe declared the first case of AIDS in 1985, the year in which it was submitted.
I took care of a number of people with AIDS early in 1980, when I did medical training at Harlem Hospital, but-- we had no idea what was in Africa's warehouse.
The infection rate rose about 2% during the first days I was there.
This can increase for one out of four adults 17 years after Harare left.
By mid-1990, I learned about hundreds of people in a very small year who were infected with HIV.
I've seen many colleagues and friends die, my students and hospital patients die.
And as a response to these cases, I have with my colleagues founded a hospital.
We made several interventions to explain the use of condoms.
We have made interventions in the educational and work settings.
We did research, and we gave guidance to the injured men's partners on how to protect themselves.
We worked hard at the time. I thought I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, like it was.
But I wasn't talking about structural change.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke of his personal failure, which led to the genocide in Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the head of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping.
In the memory of 10 years of genocide, he said: "I thought I was doing my best, but after the genocide I realized that there were many things that could have been done or that I had to do to scrutinize danger and join efforts to provide support."
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has defused the health of the unprepared society, and today the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that nearly 39 million people are being saved because of this disease, not the only one that is oblivious to feel sorry and regret for not doing more earlier.
But while I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't see myself as an advocate or a politician.
I was there to improve my technical skills, my research skills on epidemics.
In my mind, my career is to care for patients and research to better understand the patterns of transmission among the population, and I was hoping to slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially marginalized strata of the population are the most at risk of AIDS and death.
For sugar cane farms, which are much more default-based than any modern institution, 60 per cent of pregnant women have been infected with HIV.
It has worked to clarify that the injury is not related to moral degradation, but rather to the culture of male superiority, employment and colonization of migrants.
As health professionals, our tools were very limited: we called on people to change their individual behaviour, use condoms and reduce the number of partners.
The infection rates have risen, and when the treatment is available in the West, the treatment that remains our most powerful weapon against HIV has not been available to the public sector in Africa.
I did not mention the unequal access to these life-saving medicines or tacit economic and political systems that were the cause of injury rates among many people.
I justified Scotty by reminding myself that I am only a guest in this country. That the rigour of danger could trigger my expulsion, prevent me from doing good work, caring for patients and doing research that I most need.
So I did not speak of the Government &apos; s early position on AIDS.
I didn't express my fears loud enough.
Some doctors and health professionals will think I didn't do anything wrong.
Our agreement with our patients, a bureaucracy division and his derivatives, is about the sanctity of the relationship between the doctor and the patient.
And I've done everything I can for every patient of mine.
But I knew that epidemics were emerging over the differences in our society, which not only reflected biology but, more importantly, patterns of marginalization and exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, social strata and others.
That's right for AIDS.
That was the case of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who studied AIDS in Haiti, are called structural violence: abuse is inherent in economic and political organization in our social world, often in invisible ways for people of excellence and power, and since violence is a reflection -- early deaths, suffering and disease -- is a kind of violence.
We do little things for our patients if we fail to regulate these social inequalities.
Rape of risk is the first stage of the dissemination of the right to public health, which is the way to combine support efforts to overcome this situation and bring about some kind of change.
So these days, I won't be quiet anymore.
I'll talk about a lot of things, even if listeners don't feel comfortable, even if I don't feel comfortable either.
Many of my words will be related to ethnic and racial differences in institutions, things that are supposed to never exist in this country, which are not supposed to exist in the field of medicine or public health.
But it exists, and we pay them to end our lives before it's time.
For this reason, the danger bell on the impact of racism on health in the United States of America, and the ongoing violence between individuals and within institutions and people with black skin, which have doubled our tragic heritage for 250 years of slavery, should be dissociated from the application of the laws of Jim Crowe and 60 years of turbulent equality, the bell of danger for this is fundamental and central to do my job properly as the New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, early death -- death before age 65 -- is 50% higher for black than white people.
A black woman in 2012 was more than 10 times at birth than a white woman.
Although we have taken tremendous steps in reducing infant mortality, black infants face almost three times the risk of death in their first year compared to white infants.
New York City is no exception.
These statistics correspond to other statistics throughout the United States.
A recent analysis of the New York Times has shown that 1.5 million black people are missing.
They pointed out that more than one in six black men, who were supposed to be between 25 and 45 years old, had been lost and disappeared from daily life, and had entered or died prematurely.
This is a great deal of inequality in everyday and inappropriate acts of violence faced by young black people, and recent protests have been centred around the motto of a life of black people.
But we must remember that permanent and differential proportions and the consequences of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes and AIDS -- are diseases that can lead to death slowly and completely calmly and may take many lives prematurely.
Since the movement of the Black People's Life has spread, I felt frustrated and angry because the medical community has opposed the use of the word "racism" in our research and studies.
You probably felt something whenever I said that.
Our medical students protested the Dae-Ins way in their white blouses, but the medical community supported this negatively since discrimination continues to affect the level of disease for people and deaths.
I am concerned about the trend of accurate and personal medicine, in search of biological or genetic targets for better treatments, which may unwittingly deviate us from the overall picture of the topic, the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works and loves, and more importantly, to determine the health of the population, and for many of us, "poor health."
As health professionals, in our daily work, both at the hospital and at the time of research, we are witnessing a situation of great inequality: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has other priorities, the transgenders who think of suicide because our society is so cruel, the single mother who must feel responsible for the poor health of her son.
Our role as health professionals is not only to treat our patients, but to ring a bell and call for change.
Whether it's credible or not, our community position gives our voices great credibility, and it shouldn't be overemphasized.
I'm better off not talking in Zimbabwe, and I made a vow to myself that as a health commissioner in New York City, I'm gonna use every opportunity for me to ring a bell and join forces to support health equity.
I will speak against racism and hope that you will join me, and I will join you when you speak of discrimination on the basis of sex or any other form of equality.
It is time for us to promote and speak loudly about structural inequality.
We shouldn't have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
Our patients' health, our health, we all depend on it.
Well, by raising hands, how many of you have canceled someone's Facebook friendship because he said something disturbing about politics or religion, child protection or food?
And how many of you are trying to ignore at least one person because you simply don't want to talk to them.
You know, we just had to follow Henry Higgins' advice at May Fair Lady, and she's sticking to talk about weather and health.
But these days, with climate change and vaccine control, those topics-- they're not safe either.
That is why this world in which we live, the world in which every conversation has the capacity to turn into a debate, since politicians cannot talk to each other and since until I understand the issues, they find those who fight for them or against them emotionally, it is not natural.
Bio Research has studied 10,000 American adults and found that at this moment, we are more intelligent and more divided than ever in history.
And we're unlikely to have a compromise, which means we don't listen to each other.
We make decisions about our living places, who we marry, and even who our friends will be, depending on what we believe in earlier.
Again, that means we don't listen to each other.
The conversation requires a rally between speech and hearing, and somewhere along the way, this conversation we lose this balance.
Now, part of that goes back to technology.
Smart phones that are either in your hands or close enough so they can be accessed quickly.
According to Pio Reich's research, about a third of Americans send over 100 messages a day.
Many of them, almost mostly, are more likely to share messages with their friends than to see them face to face.
There's an excellent article in Atlantic magazine.
She was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his kids a call project.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular subject without using the notes.
He said, "I realized... ♪
I realized that being able to talk might be one of the most skilled we failed to teach.
Children spend hours every day engaging with ideas and some through screens, but rarely have a chance to refine personal communication skills.
This question may sound funny, but we have to ask ourselves: is there any skill in the 21st century more important than being able to maintain a cohesive and confident conversation?
Now, I'm talking directly to people, including Nobel Prize holders, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of State and plumbers.
I'm talking to people I love. I talk to people I don't like.
I'm talking to some people I'm deeply disagreed with at the personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to make the next 10 minutes to teach you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this matter, things like looking at a person's eye during speeches, thinking in advance of interesting topics for discussion, looking, moving the head and smiling to show that you're his caller, repeating or summarizing what you just heard.
I want you to forget all that.
Because that's stupid!
There's no reason for you to learn how to show your attention if you're really careful.
Now, I actually use the same skills in the professional interviews I do in normal life.
So, I'm gonna teach you how to meet people, which actually helps you learn how to get better confused.
You know you have a conversation without wasting your time and not getting bored, for God's sake, without offending anyone.
We all had important previous conversations.
We've done it before, and we know what it looked like.
The kind of conversation you're having with her and you're inspiring, or what you're feeling is that you've been in deep contact or that you've been well understood.
There's no reason that most of your relationships aren't like hers.
So I have 10 basic rules to explain to you, but honestly, if you choose only one of them and you do it, you'll enjoy a great conversation.
No. 1: No multiple assignments.
And I don't mean here to leave your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or anything else in your hands.
But what I mean, be mindful.
Live the moment.
Don't think about the argument between you and your boss.
And don't think about what you're gonna have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half inside and half out of the conversation!
Don't hold your mind.
If you want to ask your opinion without giving any chance to answer or discuss, or increase and develop on your idea, write a code.
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't let the critics be on my show because they're really boring.
If they were conservative, you would find them hated Obama, food stamps and abortion.
And if they were liberals, they would hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
We can totally predict that.
And you don't want to be.
You need to enter every conversation on the assumption that you have something you want to learn.
As the famous healer Scott Beck said, it requires the right hearing by putting the breath aside.
That sometimes means canceling your personal opinion.
As we felt that acceptance, the speaker would be less likely and more likely to open up to his own people and what was inside his mind to listen.
Again, let's assume you want to know something.
And as Bill Nye said, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't know. ♪
And I listened it that way: everybody's expert on something.
III. Use open questions.
In this case, the reference is journalists.
Start asking you what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complicated question, you'll get an easy answer.
If I asked you, "Are you scared?"
You're gonna answer the strongest word in the sentence, which is "repressive," and it's gonna be "yes, you" or "no, I wasn't."
Were you angry? Yes, I was very angry.
Let them describe that they know.
Try asking them questions like "how was that?"
How did it feel?
Because then they might have to stop for a second and think about it, and so you'll get more fun answers.
Walk with the current.
That means that ideas will come to your mind and what you need is to make these ideas out of your brain.
I've often heard interviews where guests talk for a few minutes and then the host returns and asks a question that seems to have come out of nowhere or been answered in advance.
This means that the host stopped listening for two minutes because he thought of this brilliant question, and he was determined to say so.
We do the same.
We sit with someone we talk to, and suddenly we remember that day when we met Hog Jackman at the coffee shop.
And stop listening.
Stories and ideas that will occur to you,
And you need to let these ideas go and come.
If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on the radio, especially on stations like NPR, are much more aware that they're recording, so you find them more cautious about what they claim to be experts and what they claim to be confident of.
Do it carefully.
Talking shouldn't be cheap.
VI: Don't compare your experience with their experiences.
If they're talking about losing a family member, don't talk about the time you lost one of your family.
If they're talking about some of the problems you're facing at work, don't tell them how much you hate your work.
It's not the same, it won't be.
Every experience can be taken to a limit.
And more importantly, it's not about you.
You don't need to talk and try to show how amazing you are or how you've suffered before.
Someone once asked Stephen Hawking about his intelligence rate, and he said, "I have no idea. Because the people who brag about their intelligence rate are losers.
Talks are not a promotional opportunity.
Don't try to bring yourself back.
Because it's kind of self-abuse and bored, and we do it a lot.
Especially in business talks or conversations with our children, we want to reach a certain meaning, so we're just redrafting words over and over.
Don't do that.
Eighth: Stay away from the weeds.
And what I'm saying is, frankly, people don't care about years and names, dates, all these details that they have to remember.
They don't care about that and what they care about is you.
They care what you like, what things you have in common.
So, forget these details and leave them.
That's not the last point, but the most important point.
Listen up.
I may not tell you how many people told you that listening could be the most important skill they could ever develop.
Buddha said, and I'm here to put it to you, if your mouth is open, you won't learn.
Calvin Coolidge said, "No one lost his job because of his overhearing."
So why don't we hear each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I'm under control.
I don't need to hear anything I'm not interested in.
So I'm focused.
And I can enhance my identity.
But there is another reason: our attention is distracted.
The average person speaks about 225 words a minute, but we can hear 500 words a minute,
So our minds are busy and filled with 275 words like that.
I also know that it takes energy and effort to distract someone, and if you can't do it, you don't actually talk.
You're two people screaming and saying barely some sentences in the same place.
So we have to listen to each other.
Steven Kofi said it beautifully.
He said, "Most of us don't listen to understand.
But he only listens with intent to answer."
Another rule is rule 10 and it shortens you.
[Good talk like short skirt. It is short enough to bring the look, long enough to pass the ball -- my sister -- all in the same basic concept: be interested in others.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was a certain ritual in my house.
People came to talk to my grandparents, and after they went, my mom came to us, and she said, "Do you know who that was?"
She was the guardian of Miss America.
He was mayor of Scramento.
I won the Polytzer Prize. He's a famous Russian ballerina.
So I grew up on this assumption that everyone has something special hidden from them.
And frankly, I think that's what made me the best host.
I try to keep my mouth shut, my mind open, and I'm always ready to be amazing, and I've never been disappointed.
And you have to do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly, be ready to be surprised.
Thanks.
Hi.
I'm Matthew Williams. I'm a hero.
I won three different sports and national games in Canada, playing at the international level in basketball, and I am proud to have represented Canada globally.
I train five days a week on basketball and fast skiing, working with top-level trainers and psychologists to be at my best.
By the way, all that during the Special Olympics.
Does that change your idea of me and my accomplishments?
The world like me is not heroes.
Not long ago, my people were outcasts and hiding out of sight.
There have been many changes since the launch of the Special Olympics in 1968, but in many cases people with intellectual disabilities are considered invisible to others everywhere.
People use humiliating words in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
You use the word "delayed" or "delayed" in a degrading way.
They don't care how much pain and pain my friends are.
I don't want you to think that being here is because I represent a humanitarian case.
I am here because there is still a major problem with how people with intellectual disabilities are treated, or, most often, how they do not pay attention at all.
Did you know he signed the World Games this year?
You're one of over 6500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 nations competing in Los Angeles.
There were over 62,000 probationers of the opening ceremony, and there was live coverage by TSSN and SBN.
Do you know what happened?
What do you think of seeing someone like me?
I'm here today to challenge you to look at us equally.
The Special Olympics are changing the self-identity of sports with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of followers.
For those who are not aware of it, the Special Olympic Games are intended for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics are separate from the two seats and Olympics.
We offer high-quality sports tours for people with intellectual disabilities that can make changes to their lives and ideas.
This activity changed my life and so many lives.
Changed the way the world looks at those with intellectual disabilities.
Born with epilepsy and mental disability.
With my age, I played hockey to the age of 12,
The older you get, the harder it feels to communicate with everyone, and you're angry and frustrated.
I haven't had any sports for a while, I didn't have many friends and I felt like I was abandoned and I was sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from the eyes of society.
They didn't think they could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In 1960, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the physical fitness of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through careful scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion that the lack of opportunity to participate has caused physical fitness.
Much doubted the extent to which persons with intellectual disabilities benefited from physical fitness and opportunities behind sports competitions.
But the pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Jonas Kennedy Schrifer, the founders of the Special Olympic Games, Thabra and Azamba, proved that they were right more than four and a half million times.
Before I went to Special Olympics, I was nervous, because I was young, shy and unsure of myself and I didn't have a lot of friends.
When I got there, everyone was encouraging, working on your support, leaving the room to be yourself without any prior judgment.
I am now a basketball player and a skateboarder who has had several competitions at the regional and national levels, and this year he was able to attend the summer World Games in Los Angeles, where I was the first Canadian to join the basketball team and compete at the global games.
I'm one of over 4 million and 500 athletes from all over the world, and I've heard many similar stories.
Being athletes in the Special Olympics has allowed us to retrieve ourselves and our dignity.
Special Olympics address critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than ordinary men, and that women with intellectual disabilities have 20 younger years of disability.
Special Olympics work to keep us healthy by being vibrant and participating in sports.
The trainers taught us food and health rules.
Special Olympics also provide free health screening for athletes who have difficulty in communicating with the direct physician or obtaining health care.
At the 2015 Summer World Games, I played with members of my Canadian team against the Nigerian basketball team.
On the day before the game, the Nigerian basketball team was subjected to a health examination of the world &apos; s playmates, with 7 out of 10 players having access to free speeches and having been able to hear clearly for the first time.
The change they made was amazing.
They were more enthusiastic, happy and confident, because their coach was able to communicate with them with words.
And their emotions because they were able to hear the sound of basketball, the sound of the whistle, and the cheerleaders in the runways-- that sounds like a Muslim and axis.
Don't go into the special Olympics just to change the athletes.
She's also changing their lives off the field.
This year, research has shown that almost half of the adults in the United States know not even a person with mental disability, and that 44 per cent of Americans without personal contact with intellectual disabilities are less acceptable and positive.
Then there are those bold and humiliating words that prove that people with intellectual disabilities remain invisible for many people.
People use it like it's just passing words or a way of humiliation.
I mentioned in tweets more than nine million times last year, which was very painful for me and for 4 million and 500 athletes around the world.
It's not much of an insult, but it is.
As my colleague and Global Envoy John Franklin Stevens wrote in an open letter to the political critics who used them as an insult, they joined us daily in the Special Olympic Games.
Let's see if you're leaving and nothing's changed inside you.
This year, at the 2015 Summer World Games, people stood in a long row for hours to attend the finals of the Heavier Competition.
Everyone just stood up when my colleague Jackie Barrett, the big guy from Newfoundland, raised 655 pounds and raised 611 pounds in the squat situation. A new record is recorded in the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder of every athlete in Newfoundland -- not only in the Special Olympics, but in the entire weights.
Jackie was a bright star in Los Angeles, and she was impressed with his performance.
Fifty years ago, I thought a few people with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, he filled 60,000 spectators of the famous L.A. Memorial to observe the opening ceremony of world games and encourage sportsmen from 165 nations around the world.
Away from being hiding out of sight, we were getting cheerleading and celebrating us.
Special Olympics teach athletes confidence and self-esteem.
The Special Olympics gave a lesson to the world that people with special needs deserved respect and containment.
I now have my dreams and ambitions associated with this sport, good trainers, respect and dignity, good health and professionalism as a personal coach.
I'm not one of those who hide and get bullied, and here I am the oldest conversation in TED.
The world has become a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but the road is still long.
So next time you meet someone with a mental disability, I hope you can see his abilities.
The next time someone uses those bad words next to you, I hope you tell him the pain you're leaving behind.
Please consider participating in the Special Olympics.
I'd like to continue with one last thought.
As Nelson Mandela said, "for sport the ability to make a difference in the world."
The Special Olympics work to change the world by making changes in 4 million and 500 athletes and allowing us to be confident of ourselves, so as to identify friends, not to prejudge, feel that sense and be heroes.
Thank you very much.
You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Uruguay, Nigeria.
But I know they're the most unusual places on Earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, doctors and scientists fighting quietly one of the most deadly threats to humanity for years: Lasa virus.
Lasa's virus is a lot like Ebola.
My protector can be severe and often fatal.
But these people put their lives at risk every day to protect people in their community, so they protect us all.
But one of the most unusual things I've learned about them in one of my first visits there several years ago was that they started every morning -- these challenges, unusual days in front row -- singing...
They meet together, show their joy.
They show their souls.
Over the years, year after year, when I visit them and visit me, I meet with them and sing and write and love this, because this reminds us that we are not here to pursue science only together, we are bound together by our common humanity.
And that's for sure, as you can imagine, becoming very important, even basic, as something to begin change.
This was not significant in March 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This is the first epidemic in West Africa, near the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
That was scary, scary for all of us.
We were actually suspects for some time that Lassa and Ebola were spreading more than expected, and we said that one day could come to Kenya.
Thus, some members immediately came out of my team and joined D. Homar Khan and his team there, and we made a diagnosis to be able to obtain partial sensitivity tests to catch Ebola if it came across borders and within Sierra Leone.
We already had these tests for Lassa's virus. We knew how to do this.
We just had to give them the tools and the place to look forward to Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day came.
On 23 May 2014, a woman entered the maternity section of the hospital, the team conducted these important molecular tests and identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an extraordinary job done.
They were able to diagnose the situation immediately, treat the patient safely and start a follow-up call to see what was happening.
I stopped something.
But by that day, the epidemic had erupted for months?
Hundreds of cases, he's already overwhelmed all previous epidemics.
He came to Sierra Leone not as an individual case, but as a major wave.
We should have worked with the global community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to start dealing with those situations, where he brought the next week 31, 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenya, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that can cope with this.
We've worked around the clock trying to do the most we can, trying to help these people, trying to attract attention, but we also did something else simple.
From that sample we took from the patient's blood to find out Ebola, we can get him out, clearly.
The other thing we can do, actually, we're stopping him in a water, putting him in a box, then sending him across the ocean, which is what we did.
We sent him to Boston, where my team works.
And we worked around the clock, swore work on us in shifts, day after day, and fast we made 99 genome for Ebola.
This is the plan-- the viral genome is the blueprint.
We all have one.
He says everything inside us, and he says so much information.
The result of such work is simple and strong.
We can already take these 99 viruses, watch them and compare them, and we can actually see, compared to three genes, and this happened earlier and spread from Guinea, we can show the beginning of the outbreak in rich months ago, once to humans, and then move from one to another.
Now, that's very important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is to track.
We can also see that during its inter-human transmission, the virus is evolving.
Every transformation of this is very important, because of the diagnosis, vaccinations, and the treatments we use, all on this genetic sequence, basically -- this is what it leads.
And so the global health experts have to respond, they have to evolve, to check everything they've been doing.
But the way science works, and where I was at that moment, it was that I had the information, I could have worked in a lot of sympathy, a lot of months, carefully analysing information, with the introduction of the paper for publication, through several round-trip attempts, and finally, when the paper was published, we could disclose information.
That's how it works right now.
Well, that wouldn't have worked at this point, would it?
We had friends in front rows, and for us it was clear that what we needed was help, a lot of help.
And so the first thing we did was, once the sequence came out of the machines, we posted it online.
We spread it to the whole world and said, "Help us."
Help came.
Before we knew her, we were contacted from all over the world, alerted to see the information out there and its advice.
Some of the world's greatest viral followers are suddenly part of our society.
We've been working together this virtual road, sharing, regular calls, trying to track the virus a minute, find ways to stop it.
There are many ways in which we can be societies like this.
Everyone, especially when the epidemic began spreading globally, was reaching out to learn, to share, to bathe.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capacity out there was great, and the Internet brought us all together.
And you can imagine that instead of being scared of each other, that's all we said, "Let's do this."
Let's work together, let's make this happen.
But the problem was that the information we all use, searching on the Internet, is too limited to do what we need to do.
And that's a lot of opportunities lost when this happened.
So in the early part of the epidemic in Kenema, we had recorded 106 patients, and again we did this publicly available to the world.
In our labs, we can show that you can take the 106 records, we can train the computer to predict and speculate about 100% Ebola patients.
We made an application that could spread this, to make this available to health-care workers in the field.
But 106 is not enough to make it strong, to be proven.
So we're waiting for more information to release.
That information has not yet come.
We're still waiting, lighting away, in silos instead of working together.
And just-- we can't accept that.
You, all of you, can't accept this.
It's our lives on the line.
In fact, we actually lost a lot of souls, many health-care workers, including dear colleagues of mine, five colleagues of Mballo Foney, Alex Mojo Boi, Dr. Homar Khan, Alice Kovama and Mohamed Vula.
These are only five of the many health-care workers in and around Kenema who died while waiting for the world and while we all worked, quietly and in private.
So, Ebola, like all the dangers to humanity, it's a threat of mistrust, confusion and division.
When we build barriers between us and fight between us, the virus thrives.
But not like the rest of the dangers to humanity, Ebola is the only one in which we are all the same.
We're all in that war together.
Ebola's on someone's threshold could soon be on our threshold.
So in this place with the same weaknesses, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope we work together with joy.
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I discovered the word "Kenima," the hospital we work in, and the city we work in Sierra Leone, named from the word "peer like the river, transparent and open to public view."
That was very deep for us, because without knowing that, we always felt like in honor of the people in Kenema where we were working, we had to work openly, we had to share and work together.
We should have done this.
We all have to demand this for us and for others -- to be open to each other when another epidemic happens, to fight this war together.
Because this isn't the first Ebola epidemic, and it won't be the last, and there's a lot of other microbes out there waiting, like Lasa's virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it can happen in a millionaire city, it can start there.
Could be something moving through the air.
It could even be intentional.
I know it's scary, I understand it, but I also know, and this experiment will show us that we have the technology and we have the power to succeed in this thing, so let's make it work and be with the highest word on the virus.
But we can only do it together and if we do it fun.
And that's for Dr. Khan and all those who have sacrificed their lives in the initial classes of this war with us all the time, to be with them in the war.
Let us not make the world known for the destruction caused by one virus, but by billions of hearts and minds working in a unit.
Thank you.
