So, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybczynski.
She's a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr. Dead Things."
Latif Nasser: And I think she's particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up, way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra.
Now, one summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole.
NR: Really, it's not going to sound very exciting, because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil.
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.
NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored, about the size of the palm of my hand.
It was just lying on the surface.
LN: And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood, because that's the sort of thing people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before -- prehistoric plant parts.
But that night, back at camp ...
NR: ... I get out the hand lens, I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings.
Maybe it's a preservation thing, but it looks really like ...
bone.
LN: Huh. So over the next four years, she went to that spot over and over, and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone, most of them really tiny.
NR: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Ziploc bag.
LN: And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle.
But it was challenging.
NR: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces, I'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN: Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?
LN: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually.
NR: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.
LN: How certain were you that you had it right, that you had put it together in the right way?
Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way and have, like, a parakeet or something?
NR: Um, no. No, we got this.
LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been either of those.
It was just too big.
NR: The size of this thing, it was huge. It's a really big animal.
LN: So what animal could it be?
Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado, and they had an idea.
NR: We took a saw, and we nicked just the edge of it, and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.
LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.
It was a smell that Natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives structure to our bones.
And usually, after so many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.
Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting."
It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen, so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a match.
So she shipped him one of the fragments, FedEx.
NR: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.
LN: And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.
And he found a match.
that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ...
a camel.
NR: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing -- if it's true.
LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments, and they got the same result for each one.
However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.
So this camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton.
Yeah.
Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.
Now, when you hear the word "camel," what may come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.
But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these, the dromedary, quintessential desert creature -- hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara, has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks, has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.
So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?
Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are actually originally American.
They started here.
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.
LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?
NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.
You'll have some with really long necks, so they're actually functionally like giraffes.
LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.
NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?
NR: The earliest ones.
So those ones you probably would not recognize.
LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.
NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?
LN: And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa.
And then around the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.
So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.
Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.
Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.
So it would have been boreal forest, so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over.
You'd have blizzards.
You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.
Like, how ... How?
How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And it's kind of brilliant.
What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it get through the winter?
What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
What if that hump -- which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat -- was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce?
And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?
Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body.
So it helps heat dissipate easier.
It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change.
But I love it for a totally different reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes.
So I was trained as a historian.
And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.
They make sense of the past.
They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.
And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.
NR: We make up stories and we stick with it, like the camel in the desert, right?
That's a great story! It's totally adapted for that.
Clearly, it always lived there.
LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.
You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.
Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd Dr. Seuss-looking creature looks the way it does.
And for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel.
It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment, to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara, and could end up virtually anywhere.
This is Azuri.
Azuri, hi, how are you doing?
OK, here, I've got one of these for you here.
So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig at the Radio City Music Hall.
That's not even a joke.
Anyway -- But really, Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one.
It requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine.
Right, Azuri?
And, really, that we're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are.
I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience.
First, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011 that had a profound impact on me.
I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University, where I studied computer science and neuroscience, and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers.
And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation, of course, his phone lights up.
And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing.
And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes, "Keep going. I'm with you."
But of course his eyes were glazed over, and the moment was dead.
Meanwhile across the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time towards a group.
He was swiping through pictures on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically.
And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology, really got me thinking.
And the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here, it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together.
See, they were connected around something, just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire.
And that's exactly what tools should do, I think.
They should extend our bodies.
And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite.
Whether you're sending an email to your wife or you're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend, you're doing it in pretty much the same way.
You're hunched over these rectangles, fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles.
And I think this is the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine.
We should use machines that bring our work back into the world.
We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them.
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here.
It's called the Meta 2.
Let's try it out.
Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience, and I can see my very hands.
And in three, two, one, we're going to see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appear in front of me, of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now.
And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for or learning from, and I can use my hands to very nicely kind of move it around with fine control.
And I think Iron Man would be proud.
We're going to come back to this in just a bit.
Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology, so let's look at a few.
My mom is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was laying out a building in 3D space instead of having to use these 2D floor plans.
She's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor.
This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses.
And this next use case is very personal to me, it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project, courtesy of UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I would always fantasize about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine, where I could touch and play with the various brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but to me, it's part of a much more important story -- a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices, instead of the other way around.
Now ...
in the next few years, humanity's going to go through a shift, I think.
We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world.
Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today.
And what I think we need to do as a community, is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information.
And that's what I'm very passionate about.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years -- this is not the smallest device -- in about five years, these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms.
And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware -- we buy it for the operating system -- as a neuroscientist, I always dreamt of building the iOS of the mind, if you will.
And it's very, very important that we get this right, because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we've lived with the Windows graphical user interface.
And I don't know about you, but living inside of Windows scares me.
To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity, we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines, instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom.
And the principle we all revolve around is what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance."
At every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain on, for the first time, our brain's terms.
In other words, we're trying to create a zero learning-curve computer.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
Here are the first three design guidelines that we employ in this brand-new form of user experience.
First and foremost, you are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they take your brain extra steps to decode them.
We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance.
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here, and your holographic email on the other side of the desk, and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them.
You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for -- or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.
Perfect. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
The second interface guideline we call "touch to see."
What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest?
They try and reach out and touch it.
And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well.
Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception -- that's the sense of our body parts in space.
So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better, we're also going to understand it much more deeply.
Hence, touch to see.
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
We're inherently these social primates.
And this leads me to our third guideline, the holographic campfire from our first story.
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D.
So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around this thing, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind.
So again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
I'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk.
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment, we're connecting.
My spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here, reminding me that I am the operating system.
And now my proprioception is working, and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.
But it's not enough to see things alone, so in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call -- Ray?
Hey Ray, how's it going?
Guys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D.
And he is photo-realistic.
Thank you.
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long.
Ray, how's it going?
Ray: Great. We're live today.
MG: Ray, give the crowd a gift of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier.
Guys, this is not only going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we collaborate.
Thank you so much.
Thanks, Ray.
Ray: You're welcome.
MG: So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens.
It's right here, inside of us.
So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today, it's that the natural machine is not some figment of the future, it's right here in 2016.
Which is why all hundred of us at Meta, including the administrative staff, the executives, the designers, the engineers -- before TED2017, we're all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Thanks, guys.
Chris Anderson: So help me out on one thing, because there've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there.
And there's sometimes a debate among technologists about, are we really seeing the real thing on-screen?
There's this issue of field of view, that somehow the technology is showing a broader view than you would actually see wearing the glasses.
Were we seeing the real deal there?
MG: Absolutely the real deal.
Not only that, we took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens in the various videos that you've seen here.
We want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we're actually seeing through the glasses, and not cut any corners.
CA: Thank you so much for showing us that.
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites.
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I am truly grateful for my upbringing, because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit.
And in point of fact, I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.
And I went on the road as a professional French horn player, which was my lifelong dream.
I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe, and I toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird.
And by the end of my 20s, I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a great life.
And you know, my parents never complained.
They supported me all the way through it.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, he's taking a gap decade."
And -- There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about.
I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona, and I was visiting my parents for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was quiet, too quiet.
Something was wrong.
And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"
And she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you."
And I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me: have you been voting for Republicans?"
Now, the truth is, I wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player.
But I had a bit of an epiphany, and they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion.
You see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism, and I want to tell you why that is.
It stems from a lifelong interest of mine in, believe it or not, poverty.
See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty.
That's not even close.
The first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face, was when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s.
And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.
It was a picture in the National Geographic Magazine of a kid who was my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a distended belly.
And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, one just like it.
It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world.
Well, that vision kind of haunted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dropped out and dropped in and started my family.
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?
Or to people just like him all over the world?
And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for the answer: what happened to the world's poorest people?
Has it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?
And I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children, since they saw that vision.
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty gotten worse or better around the world?", 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
But here's the truth.
Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking.
From 1970 until today, the percentage of the world's population living in starvation levels, living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjusted for inflation, that percentage has declined by 80 percent.
There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a kid.
And I didn't even know about it.
This, my friends, that's a miracle.
That's something we ought to celebrate.
It's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind, and it happened in our lifetimes.
So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid, two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters, have been pulled out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why.
And I went in search of an answer.
And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know what, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists left, right and center.
And here it is.
Here are the reasons.
have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid.
Number one: globalization.
Number two: free trade.
Number three: property rights.
Number four: rule of law.
Number five: entrepreneurship.
It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after 1970 that did that.
Now, I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect, and I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need to build a better world.
But that is great.
And that's beyond politics.
Here's what I learned. This is the epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
At its best, it's about aspiration, which is what so many people on this stage talk about, is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system.
And we've got to share it with more people.
Now, I want to tell you about a second epiphany that's related to that first one that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world, but right here at home.
The best quote I've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that I've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They have lifted billions out of poverty."
Who said it?
It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
Wrong.
President Barack Obama said that.
Why do I know it by heart?
Because he said it to me.
Crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah."
But more than that, I said, "What an opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Georgetown University in May of 2015.
And I thought, this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today. What?
It's coming together around these ideas, liberals and conservatives, to help people who need us the most.
Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world with political polarization.
It's risen to critical, crisis levels.
It's unpleasant. It's not right.
There was an article last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the West.
And it was an article in 2014 on political motive asymmetry.
What's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents' ideology is based in hate.
It's common in world conflict.
You expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
What the authors of this article found was that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry.
A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people are walking around saying, "You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence, I want to help people, but the other guys, they're evil and out to get me."
You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry.
It's impossible.
How do we solve it?
Well, first, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let's not minimize the differences. That would be really naïve.
There's a lot of good research on this.
A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He's a psychology professor at New York University.
He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ.
And he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals have a very different emphasis on what they think is important.
For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic liberty.
And conservatives care about economic liberty 28 percent more than they care about poverty.
Irreconcilable differences, right?
We'll never come together. Wrong.
That is diversity in which lies our strength.
Remember what pulled up the poor.
It was the obsession with poverty, accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
Hmm.
How are we going to get that?
It's a tricky thing, isn't it.
We need innovative thinking.
A lot of it's on this stage.
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need investment overseas in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But you know what we really need?
We need a new day in flexible ideology.
We need to be less predictable.
Don't we?
Do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable?
Kinda conventional?
Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that dangerous?
Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, conservatives, you're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government.
And on the left, liberals, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality.
Right? Now those are important things, really important to me, really important to you.
But when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today, those are distractions.
We need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty, and liberals need conservatives and their obsession with free markets.
That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country, if we choose to take it.
So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me.
Number one. Action item number one: remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree.
It's not good enough.
We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools.
Now, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that?
Where does this start? It starts here.
You know, all of us in this room, we're blessed.
We're blessed with people who listen to us.
We're blessed with prosperity. We're blessed with leadership.
When people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology, then maybe people will listen.
Maybe progress will start at that point.
That's number one. Number two.
Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me to be the person specifically who blurs the lines, who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.
If you're a conservative, be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
And if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly.
If we do that, we get two things.
Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get.
And the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then maybe, just maybe, we'll all realize that our big differences aren't really that big after all.
Thank you.
So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers.
Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this.
So, you know -- you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil.
And I would want to do that like that.
That would be the plan.
I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this.
And that would happen every single paper.
But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.
It was way too big a project.
So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
This is how the year would go.
So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase.
How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?
No big deal, right?
But then, the funniest thing happened.
Those first few months?
They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff.
So we had an awesome new revised plan.
And then -- But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here.
And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks.
And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline.
I thought that was the end of everything.
But a week later I get a call, and it's the school.
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"
And I say, "Yeah."
And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis."
And I say, "OK."
And they say, "It's the best one we've ever seen."
That did not happen.
It was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
No, no, it was very, very bad.
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
I write the blog Wait But Why.
And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are.
Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people.
And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them.
I actually brought them here to show you today.
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now ...
here's my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?
Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.
[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened.
Then -- Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom.
"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.
Sorry!"
Now, what is going on here?
The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun.
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.
If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success!
And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK.
But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.
We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.
Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
We can visualize the future.
We can see the big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all of that into account.
And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now.
to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time.
That's why there's an overlap.
Sometimes they agree.
But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture.
And that's when we have a conflict.
And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.
I call it the Dark Playground.
Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well.
It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.
The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings.
And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster.
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence.
And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.
Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk.
Now, of course, I said yes.
It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?
Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
We need to sit down and work on this right now."
And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India."
So that's what we did that day.
As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers.
And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me.
And guess who woke up?
So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree!
And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk.
Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages.
And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system.
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
When I did, I was amazed by the response.
Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things.
These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students.
And they were all writing, saying the same thing: "I have this problem too."
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails.
These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them.
And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?
Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.
Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines.
And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline.
So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts, something entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going.
There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up.
He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever.
And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.
It's usually suffered quietly and privately.
And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.
And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place.
It's not that they're cramming for some project.
It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives.
The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators.
Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call this a Life Calendar.
That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.
That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those.
So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.
We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
That's a job for all of us.
And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but ...
You know.
Sometime soon.
Thank you.
There we were, souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
Packed into a room just like this, but with creaky wooden pews draped in worn-down red fabric, with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them.
A room like this, nonetheless.
With the same great feelings of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention.
This was December 31, 1999, the night of the Second Coming of Christ, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability.
And once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.
So I went to church as often as I could.
I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early.
And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time.
And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight, I had another shot.
All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast, fight off demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.
It would be hard -- but I knew I could do it.
But planning time was over now.
It was 11:50pm.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck.
So every faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir stayed in the choir stand, the deacons and their wives -- or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them -- took first position in front of the altar.
You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly -- these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock.
And as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right in behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven.
And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this prayer, I might go right on with her.
So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
And the prayers got louder.
And the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still.
And the organ rolled on in to add the dirge.
And the heat came on to add to the sweat.
And my hand gripped firmer, so I wouldn't be the one left in the field.
My eyes clenched tighter so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff.
And then a voice rang out above us: "Amen."
It was over.
I looked at the clock.
It was after midnight.
I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now.
But I was upset on their behalf.
They had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, and I had gone right along with them.
I had prayed their prayers, I had yielded not to temptation as best I could.
I had dipped my head not once, but twice in that snot-inducing baptism pool.
I had believed.
Now what?
I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world.
It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones.
And this made me feel even more ridiculous -- hurt, really.
But there on that night, I did not stop believing.
I just believed a new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude, there was, running right down to its foundation, a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers.
I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth.
And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way, I'm convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come.
And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in.
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself back home one winter break, with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a burglar's gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So hopeful -- that I called home to inform my family that we'd never be poor again.
But as I witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer, who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, saying, "It's been a long time coming, but in this election, change has come to America."
But as the Congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me.
I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power.
But over and over again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead.
And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die.
So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca, Harvard Business School -- this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer.
No, I knew there'd be more work to do.
The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time: "What if we took a road trip?"
We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country.
So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin, we went on anyhow.
We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the cow pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line.
And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism, this struck us as a revolutionary idea.
And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today.
It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning.
It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help.
But if I'm being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it.
There was no length to which I would not go to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time.
But it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel that I've come to share with you today.
It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
Under a full-size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds.
There was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management surpassed half a trillion dollars.
We looked over all that we had made, and it was good.
But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Harlem, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day.
All of them lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them came to Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to get the only meal they had each day.
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension, after 20 years as a cab driver.
He told me that he didn't give himself a salary, because despite success, the program struggled for resources.
He told me that he would take any help that he could get.
And I was there as that help.
But as I left Tony, I felt the sting and salt of tears welling up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day.
And it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry, it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids, it wasn't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the 99.
No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they didn't have any boots; that my organization stood in for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated.
And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium again and again and again.
I had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled.
But this time, the false savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible truth.
Yes, I've come so far that I'm right back where I started.
Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief -- no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god, we take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth.
And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one brick, because we fear it might shake our whole foundation.
But if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept, then it must be questioning time.
So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line.
I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact.
I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing, it asks that you believe a new thing: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it raises the question, "Why?"
With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad?
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business.
We have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it fuels me, it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelm us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise, when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith -- no, it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whisper
or to shout or to say simply, very simply, "There must be another way."
Thank you.
Food crisis.
It's in the news every day.
But what is it?
Some places in the world it's too little food, maybe too much.
Other places, GMO is saving the world.
Maybe GMO is the problem?
Too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans, toxic oceans, attenuation of nutrition.
They go on and on.
And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering.
So how do we bring that to something that we understand?
How is this apple food crisis?
You've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure.
How old do you think it was from when it was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months -- the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don't expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold storage, we gas the cold storage -- there's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying, because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew this?
Why didn't I know this?
Ninety percent of the quality of that apple -- all of the antioxidants -- are gone by the time we get it.
It's basically a little ball of sugar.
How did we get so information poor and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform.
I know platforms -- I know computers, they put me on the Internet when I was young.
I did very weird things -- on this platform.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a platform, we might feel empowered to question: What if?
For me, I questioned: What if climate was democratic?
So, this is a map of climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They shift and they change, and Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers.
China picks up land in Brazil to grow better food, and we're a slave to climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
What would that change about how we live?
What would that change about quality of life and nutrition?
The last generation's problem was, we need more food and we need it cheap.
Welcome to your global farm.
We built a huge analog farm.
All these traces -- these are cars, planes, trains and automobiles.
It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food.
What if ...
we built a digital farm?
A digital world farm.
What if you could take this apple, digitize it somehow, send it through particles in the air and reconstitute it on the other side?
What if?
Going through some of these quotes, you know, they inspire me to do what I do.
First one: ["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future."] That's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku, one stop south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70 percent of their own food.
But it's not unique to Japan.
Two percent of the American population is involved in farming.
What good answer comes from two percent of any population?
As we go around the world, 50 percent of the African population is under 18.
Eighty percent don't want to be farmers.
Farming is hard.
The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable.
They go into the city.
In India: farmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities, more farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that.
It's uncomfortable to talk about.
Where are they going?
Into the city.
No young people, and everyone's headed in.
So how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine.
A number of years ago now, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and I started hacking.
And I built silly things and I made plants dance and I attached them to my computer and I killed them all -- a lot.
I eventually got them to survive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They said, "Knock yourself out, kid!
Here's an old electronics room that nobody wants.
What can you do?"
With my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab, a place historically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life.
Inside of these 60 square feet, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month -- not a lot of food.
And there's a lot of interesting technology in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful, white roots, deep, green colors and a monthly harvest.
Is this a new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new grocery store?
I can tell you one thing for sure: this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything.
We get our salad in bags; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image-based processing expert, a data scientist, a roboticist, ripping roots off and thinking, "Huh. I know something about -- I could make this happen, I want to try."
In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab, because if you grew it, you don't throw it away; it's kind of precious to you.
I have this weird tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat lettuce every day and I can tell the pH of a lettuce within .1.
I'm like, "No, that's 6.1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today."
This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.
It was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!"
And the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me.
Technologists falling backwards into plant physiology.
So we thought other people needed to be able to try this.
We want to see what people can create, so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere.
And then we built it.
So on the facade of the media lab is my lab, that has about 30 points of sensing per plant.
If you know about the genome or genetics, this is the phenome, right?
The phenomena.
When you say, "I like the strawberries from Mexico," you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression that you like.
So if you're coding climate -- this much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe -- you're coding the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, the size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what's going on.
If you think of your houseplants, and you look at your houseplant and you're super sad, because you're like, "Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"
Farmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes by the time they're in their late 60s and 70s.
They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency or it needs more humidity.
Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down.
These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.
We trend those data points over time.
We correlate those data points to individual plants.
These are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address.
We have IP-addressable broccoli.
So if that's not weird enough, you can click one and you get a plant profile.
And what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant, but not like you'd think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does it achieve the nutrition that I need?
When does it achieve the taste that I desire?
Is it getting too much water?
Is it getting too much sun?
Alerts.
It can talk to me, it's conversant, we have a language.
I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right?
That's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends.
And I mean it -- it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now.
And they may not friend us back -- I don't know, they might friend us back, it depends on how we act.
So this is my lab now.
It's a little bit more systematized, my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
And so -- inside of this environment, we're experimenting with all kinds of things.
This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station for reducing the amount of water they send into space.
What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen.
Roots are not that complicated, so when you give them that, you get this amazing expression.
It's like the plant has two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is perfect world.
So we've grown all kinds of things.
These tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years.
Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks?
Banks of seed.
It's amazing.
They have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten.
I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato.
Problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook, so we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great.
But we've done things with protein -- we've grown all kinds of things.
We've grown humans -- Well maybe you could, but we didn't.
But what we realized is, the tool was too big, it was too expensive.
I was starting to put them around the world and they were about 100,000 dollars.
Finding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted to make a small one.
This project was actually one of my student's -- mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille.
So Camille and I and my team, we iterated all summer, how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it so other people can make it.
Then we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade.
And if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something.
So I went into this school and I said, "Set it to 65 percent humidity."
The seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air."
He said, "There's no water in air, you're an idiot."
And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me.
Actually -- don't trust me, right?
Set it to 100.
He sets it to 100 and what happens?
It starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip.
And he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.
Why didn't you just tell me that?"
We've created an interface for this that's much like a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone, on their tablet.
They have different parts of the bots -- the physical, the sensors.
They select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world.
They select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling.
While it's growing, they make changes.
They're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?
It kills people."
Crank up CO2, plant dies.
Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.
Harvest plant, and you've created a new digital recipe.
It's an iterative design and development and exploration process.
They can download, then, all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do -- was it better or was it worse?
Imagine these as little cores of processing.
We're going to learn so much.
Here's one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school in three weeks' time.
This is three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer -- or that he would want to be a farmer.
So, we've open-sourced all of this.
It's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer.
It's going to be difficult -- I'm just telling you.
We're in the beginning, but it's all there.
It's very important to me that this is easily accessible.
We're going to keep making it more so.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, plant scientist, economist, urban planners.
On one platform, doing what they're good at.
But we got a little too big.
This is my new facility that I'm just starting.
This warehouse could be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside of this warehouse we're going to build something kind of like this.
These exist right now.
Take a look at it.
These exist, too.
One grows greens, one grows Ebola vaccine.
Pretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner is one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola.
The plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant.
So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, all they way down to lettuce.
But these two things look nothing alike, and that's where I am with my field.
Everything is different.
We're in that weird "We're alright" stage and it's like, "Here's my black box --" "No, buy mine."
"No, no, no -- I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable.
Don't buy his, buy mine."
And the reality is, we're just at the beginning, in a time when society is shifting, too.
When we ask for more, cheaper food, we're now asking for better, environmentally friendly food.
And when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget, the most mysterious food item of all time -- they are now basing their marketing plan on that -- everything is changing.
So into the world now.
Personal food computers, food servers and food data centers run on the open phenome.
Think open genome, but we're going to put little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can pull down, actuate and grow.
What does this look like in a world?
You remember the world connected by strings?
We start having beacons.
We start sending information about food, rather than sending food.
This is not just my fantasy, this is where we're already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon-to-be food data centers, connecting people together to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this.
We know what's wrong with this.
The future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.
There are times when I feel really quite ashamed to be a European.
In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pathetic.
There are just so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon hosts more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of human smugglers, and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We have labor shortages, and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, and yet -- we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers, that separate children from their families, and that seize property from refugees.
What are we doing?
How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.
I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
And second, what can we do to fix it?
So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys.
Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution.
But today, that system is failing.
In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from.
But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo.
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees.
The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong.
It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that's what we need to reconsider.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee regime actually work?
But not from a top-down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee.
So imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call her Amira.
And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.
Amira, like around 25 percent of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you, Homs, a once beautiful and historic city now under rubble.
And so Amira can't go back there.
But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp.
In the camp, she might get assistance, but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family.
Camps are in bleak, arid locations, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime.
There's restricted economic activity.
Education is often of poor quality.
And around the world, some 80 percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years.
It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians choose that option.
Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut.
That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken.
But there, there's great difficulty as well.
Refugees in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.
They don't usually get significant access to assistance.
And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution.
So there's a third alternative, and it's one that increasing numbers of Syrians are taking.
Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.
Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today.
But I think it's a false choice.
I think we can reconsider that choice.
The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees, and they're not.
Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens.
We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.
But they don't have to. They can contribute.
So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else: the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves.
And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees.
All four ways have one thing in common: they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries.
It's not. It's exceptional.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity.
It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.
And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community.
In the capital city, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country.
In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses.
We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions.
Against the odds of extreme constraint, refugees are innovating, and the gentleman you see before you is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's now making films.
He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little.
It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are all important in the emergency phase, but we need to also look beyond that.
We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking.
All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken.
Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees But there are still pragmatic alternative options that we can use.
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals.
And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area.
The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lacked two things: access to labor and inward investment.
So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps, able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria?
We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing.
It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria.
We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.
It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago, and a pilot will begin in the summer.
The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off.
The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets, ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees, to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations, but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match.
Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching.
The matching idea has been successfully used to match, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney donors with patients, and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites.
So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?
It could also be used at the national level, where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all.
So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas.
Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable.
It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: that in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described.
But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities?
They're completely unnecessary journeys, and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on Europe's borders and within European territory.
If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that, and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa, that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to Europe.
It costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advantages.
It would save lives, it would undercut the entire market for smugglers, and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands.
It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution.
And this is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil.
And in that scheme, every Syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee.
There is a historical precedent for it as well.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a viable strategy.
So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set.
They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic, impossible three options I explained to you and still leave others better off.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision, a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.
There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them.
In the new world, migration is not going to go away.
What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, they'll continue to be displaced, and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this -- not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance, not based on logics of charity, but building on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility.
I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures.
I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.
As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.
But the first time I truly went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.
And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Conservation Photographer In my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find.
They are becoming more compressed and more threatened.
As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images.
And while this approach has merits, I have come full circle.
I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love.
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists.
Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography.
I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply.
The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.
And every June and July, enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.
And boy, do those fish have good reason to run.
In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.
Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls.
They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast.
Close behind are sharks.
Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.
Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut, or a mouth full of water.
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run, I know they don't see me as prey.
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
From the shores of Africa we travel east, across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
And during the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most no bigger than the size of your pupils, are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
When plankton concentrations become patchy, manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again, very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
However, when plankton densities increase, the mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains, and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.
As plankton levels peak in the bay, the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.
And as they swirl in tight formation, this multi-step column of mantas creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.
The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development.
And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine-protected area.
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins.
Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, "There be dragons."
And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Bassas da India, a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night.
Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.
Capturing and sharing moments like this -- that reminds me why I chose my path.
Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California.
And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a critical calving ground for gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us.
This species truly has made a remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse.
In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.
But don't take my word for it -- come with me.
On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the ability to be creators of hope.
And through my photography, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist.
And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lagoon or possibly, in the one after it.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: health care services, primary education became essentially free.
A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, a truly remarkable accomplishment.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized.
By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent.
I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable.
Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans -- scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive public health movement.
But there were daunting challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.
I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s, when I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but -- we had no idea what lay in store for Africa.
Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.
These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later.
By the mid-1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-positive.
I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die.
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We did condom demonstrations.
We launched school education and workplace interventions.
We did research. We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was.
But I was not talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department.
At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, he reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support."
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier.
But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one.
I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills.
And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS.
And on the sugar plantations, which really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-positive.
I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority, to forced migrant labor and to colonialism.
Whites were largely unscathed.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, reduce number of partners.
Infection rates climbed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa.
I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population.
I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country, that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much-needed research.
So I didn't speak out about the government's early stance on AIDS.
I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors, health professionals, may think I did nothing wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
for each and every patient of mine.
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more.
It was true of AIDS.
It was true just recently of Ebola.
Medical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural violence: structural because inequities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power; and violence because its impact -- premature deaths, suffering, illness -- is violent.
We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together.
So these days, I'm not staying quiet.
I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listeners uncomfortable, even when it makes me uncomfortable.
And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health.
But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut short.
That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this as New York City's Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature mortality -- that's death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones.
A black woman in 2012 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman.
And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby.
New York City's not exceptional.
These statistics are paralleled by statistics found across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country.
They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or premature death.
There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.
But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV -- diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been reluctant to even use the word "racism" in our research and our work.
You've probably felt something every time I've said it.
Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats, but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality.
And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great injustice: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing priorities; the transgender youth who is contemplating suicide because our society is just so harsh; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child.
Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Rightfully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and we shouldn't waste that.
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality.
It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it.
All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion, childcare, food?
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them?
You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- are not safe either.
So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history.
We're less likely to compromise, which means we're not listening to each other.
And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe.
Again, that means we're not listening to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
Now, part of that is due to technology.
The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.
And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face.
There's this great piece in The Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
And he gave his kids a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.
And he said this: "I came to realize..."
"I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.
Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills.
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summarize it.
So I want you to forget all of that.
It is crap.
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention.
Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody.
We've all had really great conversations.
We've had them before. We know what it's like.
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.
So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations.
Number one: Don't multitask.
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.
I mean, be present.
Be in that moment.
Don't think about your argument you had with your boss.
Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.
Number two: Don't pontificate.
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog.
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring.
If they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.
If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.
Totally predictable.
And you don't want to be like that.
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.
The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.
He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener.
Again, assume that you have something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."
I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.
Number three: Use open-ended questions.
In this case, take a cue from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let them describe it. They're the ones that know.
Try asking them things like, "What was that like?"
"How did that feel?"
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.
Number four: Go with the flow.
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind.
We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.
That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that.
And we do the exact same thing.
We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
And we stop listening.
Stories and ideas are going to come to you.
You need to let them come and let them go.
Number five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.
Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure.
Do that. Err on the side of caution.
Talk should not be cheap.
Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.
If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.
If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job.
It's not the same. It is never the same.
All experiences are individual.
And, more importantly, it is not about you.
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered.
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."
Conversations are not a promotional opportunity.
Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending, and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot.
Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over.
Don't do that.
Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.
Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind.
They don't care. What they care about is you.
They care about what you're like, what you have in common.
So forget the details. Leave them out.
Number nine: This is not the last one, but it is the most important one.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop.
Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."
Why do we not listen to each other?
Number one, we'd rather talk.
When I'm talking, I'm in control.
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.
I'm the center of attention.
I can bolster my own identity.
But there's another reason: We get distracted.
The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.
So our minds are filling in those other 275 words.
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.
You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place.
You have to listen to one another.
Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.
He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand.
We listen with the intent to reply."
One more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject. -- My Sister] All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people.
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home.
People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was?
She was the runner-up to Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."
And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them.
And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed.
You do the same thing.
Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
Thanks.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion.
I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport.
By the way, all that is through Special Olympics.
Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments?
The world does not see all people like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away.
There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population.
People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
That's the word "retard" or "retarded" used in a derogatory manner.
They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case.
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all.
Did you know the World Games happened this year?
I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA.
There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies, and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN.
Did you even know that happened?
What do you think of when you see someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals.
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching.
For those of you who aren't familiar, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics.
We offer high-quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and those of so many others. And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.
The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustrated.
For a while, I did not play any sports, didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society.
No one thought they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer.
Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over.
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, not confident and didn't have many friends.
When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging, supportive, and let me be myself without being judged.
Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games.
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories.
Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs.
Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport.
Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time.
The change in them was amazing.
They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them.
And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands -- sounds that we take for granted.
Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport.
Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field.
This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive.
Then there's the r-word, proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a casual term or an insult.
It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet.
People don't think it's insulting, but it is.
As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult, "Come join us someday at Special Olympics.
See if you walk away with your heart unchanged."
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition.
So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, deadlifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squat -- setting huge new records for Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland -- not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters.
Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden away, we were cheered and celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.
Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I am no longer hidden, bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk.
The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still farther to go.
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their ability.
The next time someone uses the r-word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hurts.
I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.
I would like to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sports has the power to change the world."
Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and get to feel like and be champions.
Thank you very much.
You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria.
But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal.
But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing.
They gather together, and they show their joy.
They show their spirit.
And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together; we're bonded through a shared humanity.
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change.
And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And it was frightening, frightening for us all.
We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.
And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone.
We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding.
We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was an exceptional work that was done.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on.
It could've stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months.
With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We had to work with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing.
From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously.
The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint.
We all have one.
It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human.
Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing.
We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating.
And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally -- that's what drives it.
And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing.
But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.
That's the way the status quo works.
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help.
So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web.
We just released it to the whole world and said, "Help us."
And help came.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released.
Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community.
We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together, and let's make this happen."
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.
And so many opportunities get missed when that happens.
So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world.
And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy.
And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health-care workers in the field.
But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful, to validate it.
So we were waiting for more data to release that.
and the data has still not come.
We are still waiting, tweaking away, in silos rather than working together.
And this just -- we can't accept that.
Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that.
It's our lives on the line.
And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately.
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division.
When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives.
But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same.
We're all in this fight together.
Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours.
And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy.
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word "Kenema," the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, is named after the Mende word for "clear like a river, translucent and open to the public gaze."
That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together.
And we have to do that.
We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there.
It could be something that's transmitted through the air.
It could even be disseminated intentionally.
And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses.
But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always.
And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
