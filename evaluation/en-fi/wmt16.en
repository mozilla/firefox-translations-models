A 9-year-old boy missing at Tampere was found
The police organised a search at Tampere on Tuesday evening because a 9-year old boy ran away.
The boy started off from western Tampere with a friend, and a missing person notice spread in social media.
According to police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and there is no danger to his life or health.
Around midnight, the father of the boy informed Ilta-Sanomat that the boy has been found.
He is fine, and now we begin to settle the situation.
The boy was found near home, the father said.
Ronaldo’s fantastic game - increases goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in La Liga this weekend and continued scoring also in the Champions League.
The competition between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal scoring record is, at least for the moment, tipping the scales in favour of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved clear on his own at the top of the all-time scoring charts, after scoring twice from spot-kicks and once from a game situation against guest team Shakhtar Donetsk.
Ronaldo increased his goal scores to 80, when before Tuesday he was level with Barcelona’s Messi on 77 goals.
Real won the match 4-0.
Early this season, Juventus has struggled in the Italian football league, Seri A, but it had a strong start in the D Group of the Champions League as it won Manchester City 2-1 in an away game.
The winning goal was scored about ten minutes before the end byt Juventus’ Alvaro Morata.
City’s strikes were blunted because they were lacking Sergei Aguero, who has a knee injury.
Aguero picked up an injury in the weekend’s Premier League game, and did not make an appearance until the final ten minutes.
The other Manchester team United also had a rough night in Holland, as they suffered a 1-2 defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
ManU's 20-year-old back Luke Shaw’s away match only lasted for a quarter of an hour.
PSV’s Hector Moreno’s dangerous-looking lunge hit the ManU back so badly that Shaw probably broke his shin bone.
Shaw lay on the Eindhoven home stadium turf for about ten minutes, before the medical personnel took him to the hospital to be treated.
Memphis Depay scored 1-0 for the guests on the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno squared the game on overtime before the break.
PSV’s winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh on the second half-time.
This season’s Champions League scoring was opened by Paris Saint-Germain in the A Group.
The Argentinian who changed Manchester United’s shirt to PSG’s jersey, Angel Di Maria, was to be thanked for the goal.
Di Maria burst down the right and steered the ball into the far corner past Malmö’s goalie, Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG during the second half-time.
PSG is mentioned among this season’s possible successes.
It is not a wrong assumption, but Malmö, who is one of the small clubs in the League, is not the best possible point of comparison.
PSG’s star striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, faced his original team, Malmö FF, for the first time.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes, when his team, PFC CSKA Moscow lost 0-1 for Wolfsburg in a B Group match in Germany.
Opposition party calls for immediate resignation - President read a wrong speech
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has read out the same speech he already gave a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has read out the same speech in the parliament he already gave in the end of the last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realise that the speech was same than before.
The speech raised doubts about whether 91-year-old Mugabe is of a sound mind.
The main opposition party MDC calls for Mugabe’s resignation, as he is too old to lead.
Mugabe’s spokesmen rushed to state that the mix-up happened only in Mugabe’s secretarial office, and that the President has done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech then and now discussed China's effect on the country’s economy.
Germany and Austria call for a special EU summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed a special EU leader summit for next week to discuss the refugee crisis.
European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, is evaluating the call.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the heads of state should discuss co-operation with the countries of origin, as well as how to more effectively register those arriving to Europe.
According to Merkel, the discussions about asylum seeker quotas belong to the Ministers of the Interior.
In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.
Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.
This year, he was only teaching two online classes.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.
He was quite the heartthrob back then.
All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together in the occasional gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.
Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country, down from the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing applicants this month, with staff levels rising from October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Date' With Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it dawns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The movie starts and it occurs to me that I'm a fake yawn and an arm stretch away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis, and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It really is for me," said Spielberg, "inarguably the greatest time travel movie ever put on film."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select movie theaters Oct.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's stepped up military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people.
The U.N. chief again urged all parties, including the divided U.N. Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis.
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are holding out for an implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
And these numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.
That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.
Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.
And they are angry at Washington, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "mad as hell."
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.
He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and trading barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.
Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youth trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youngsters how to take photographs of their neighbourhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the project's first graduates.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped following data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the stand-out stock on the market, jumping 20% after it received a bid approach from rival AB InBev.
A deal would combine the world's two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn through a share placement as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fallers on the index, down 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear firm reported an 83% jump in half-year pre-tax profits to £46.6m.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer extra jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign to fight Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.
He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie, starting on Friday, describing the "mutual decision" as the right thing for all, but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team.
"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants
Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally, aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.
But frustrations were on the rise.
As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.
Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.
As the vice president weighs a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don't think he should.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders widens, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.
More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.
But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there's an organization that sanctioned it, whether officially or unofficially, we're going to hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
That's not to say there won't be effects, however.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.
"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.
By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this is 74 months and counting.
Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
For bonds, it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arrives.
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they just rip off the Brits
Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.
And it's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none.
"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, which saw shoppers fight over bargains, could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca
Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
Carried aloft through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand mosque.
Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.
The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Others injured will receive half that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
Number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise
Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening
At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home
If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores, which are aimed at tradesmen, while closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.
Currently the majority of staff are men.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move more towards a balance.
Fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board.
Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.
As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
Triple-S government decided to resort to mandatory law in order to save the country’s economy.
Subsequent visible effects were seen quite soon.
SAK and other labour market organisations’ head started to ache immediately, and as a result, the country stands still on Friday thanks to employees massive demonstration.
Many think that also common sense comes to a standstill then.
The question is if it is worth going on a strike, when the things are already going badly.
Some have even organised a resistance movement.
Online over 50,000 people have announced that they will not take part in the demonstration but will go to work.
During the good old consensus times, this would have been impossible.
Of course there was no internet where one could protest, but openly proclaiming to be a strike-breaker would have been a political suicide for an ordinary person.
This protest of a few tens of thousands of people is of little concern to trade unions with millions of members, but it will give them something to think about.
The position of labour movement is not as axiomatic as it still was two decades ago.
Not everyone can identify with the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the labour movement’s appeal, the government’s harsh solutions can also be seen as an absolute heaven-sent.
After things have seemed to be driven by their own momentum for years, finally the unions can get down to business: to protect the rights of an employee, explicitly and properly.
This way the government may unintentionally strengthen the role of the labour movement, as membership in a trade union can be perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the opinion on the organisers’ actions, the idea that the demonstration on Friday would somehow stop Finland is nonsense.
Finland has stopped already some time ago.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
The GDP is still dropping and unemployment rising.
You would think these things are a headache to everyone.
Hard savings ahead for Lappeenranta University: The goal is to save 8.5 million, the staff will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will begin to implement savings measures, with a goal to cut costs for a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university begins employee cooperation negotiations that concern the whole staff, with an annual savings goal of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means that there is a need to cut about 130 employees.
In addition, the goal is to save 2 million from other activities.
The background to the cooperation negotiations is the budget for 2016, which forecast a deficit of about 8.5 million to the actual operations.
The government’s cuts also have an effect.
During this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
For next year, the costs will go slightly up, but at the same time the financing from the ministry will be cut by 2 million and other financing by 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so that means the savings goal is ten per cent of the total budget.
The massive cuts targeted at teaching and research as well as the reduction of corporate financing have a significant joint effect on our university, states rector Anneli Pauli in the university press release.
Before the summer the effects of the cuts seemed more moderated, but now the reduction of additional financing is shown in new proportions.
The discussions with the employee’s representatives will begin on Tuesday next week and they will last six weeks as provided in the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants a share in Finnish railways
The owner of the low-fare bus service operator Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter said to Yle that the company has also set their sights on Finnish railway traffic.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish railway traffic.
My company Stagecoach is one of the largest railway traffic companies in Britain, said Souter.
The competition in the railway traffic is to be opened gradually.
First part to open is metropolitan area commuter rail in 2017-2018.
After commuter rail, intercity service will open up.
Souter says he has already contacted Ministry of Transport and Communications.
According to Yle, the ministry considers Onnibus plans welcome.
As to other international companies, at least Transdev (previously Veolia) has announced that they are interested in the railway traffic. The company also has bus services in Finland and railway traffic elsewhere in Europe.
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it, now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has been performing relatively well, the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.
However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.
He said "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that is "not going to bother anyone" but is likely upset.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said: "I am so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.
Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.
Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor has also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008, he was busted for drug possession.
All that stuff sure does take a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens.
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."

The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?
It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, it seems, you are David Cameron.
Asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids' book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company, continuing: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."
All very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.
"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."
Given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.
I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance home and away.
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.
I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.
People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side.
Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.
While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
A European diplomat chum explained the other day that, sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don't want.
In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local grandee, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is a fading force too.
Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left.
It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.
"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."
The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.
They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.
The press never forgave him that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying its commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.
Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.
I struggle to see how it's public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's more niche public service programmes "go on to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched."
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of the BBC's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.
'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.
"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The adverts shaming Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Horrific killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance.
"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys which it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements, realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greeting commuters on the tube.
The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting."
"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student halls
It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship
Introverts get a raw deal at university.
Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.
That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker.
Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.
Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?
Double check with the milk owner.
Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.
This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded by turning it up.
When they finally shut up at 5am, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music, locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you?
Conversely, wouldn't it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse, hooked up, broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least talk some sense into your groin.
In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but takes moments to reverse.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
Racist attack against foreign students’ residence in Kitee - House meant as a reception centre smeared in Salo
On Saturday’s early hours a racist attack was made in a foreign students’ residence in Kitee, north Karelia.
Unlike the police had previously said, this was not an accommodation facility for underage asylum seekers, but a residence for foreign students that have been a bit longer in Finland, says a teacher of the Evangelical Folk High School of Kitee, Heidi Luukkainen.
The windows and walls of the folk high school housing facility were smeared with racists signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown across one of the windows in the housing facility, states the Eastern Finland Police Department.
According to Luukkainen, who is the lead teacher of the folk high school’s social guarantee for young people training, there were about 10 people in the building during the attack.
“It was the weekend, and adults are free to move about, so some of them might have been elsewhere, too", says Luukkainen.
There are people of 12 different nationalities accommodated in the folk high school.
They include students, who have already been a while in Finland, and recently arrived underage asylum seekers.
All the people inside the smeared building had an A-status.
“Some of them study in an adult primary school, some pursue vocational studies and some study Finnish”, describes Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner, who has already spent some time in Finland.
The Eastern Finland Police Department investigates the attack as vandalism and disturbance of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing for students was organised on Monday, with the necessary interpreters present.
“There is no panic, and nobody has wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for almost twenty years, and this is the first time something like this happens”, says Luukkainen.
According to Luukkainen, the smears have already been cleaned from the walls.
At least three men are suspected in connection to the incident and they were driving a light-coloured passenger car.
“I think this is just a young people’s whim for a weekend night, since this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious”, says Luukkainen.
Also in Salo a hospital meant to be turned into a reception centre was smeared.
The incident took place last week.
It was reported by MTV on its website oon Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall, with English words “You are not welcome” written underneath.
The offense has been reported to the police.
Correction 15.9. At 16.02. Police's false information about the status and age of the people living in the target building were corrected.
The state stops the Y-train service to Karjaa - passengers resent this, “completely idiotic”
The Y-train service from Helsinki to Raasepori’s Karjaa will come to a halt in March.
At Helsinki main railway station, many passengers in the early evening train of the said service resented the news.
This service halt will especially impact people from Siuntio, says a resident Torbjörn Bengstöm.
This is completely idiotic, since the population keeps on growing, and working people need a fast and flexible connection to Helsinki.
This cannot result from anything else but political will - or lack of it.
On HSTV interview video, Bengstöm promises to ride a tractor to the capital if needed.
There are changes in trains also elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R services that use the main line will be connected to a new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be closed.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communication together with VR published information about the routes the Ministry is going to purchase train traffic services from in the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year, with closed routes in the whole country.
The new four-year contract will be finalised in the autumn, and later approved by the appropriations committee.
Siuntio resident Bengström sees the state's train cuts as short-sighted solution.
They are making the same mistakes again they have done before, repeating them most systematically.
Then follows the regret.
Y-train is used also other people besides Raasepori and Siuntio residents, since it is fast and does not stop at every station.
Anniina Pöyry from Espoo feels bad for those that have to travel farther from the city area.
“It is especially unfortunate for those, who have to replan their journeys”, she said while climbing aboard the Y-train.
Some relief is coming.
There will probably be a new train for coastal line to replace the Y-train in Helsinki Regional Transport Authority’s (HSL) area, that is, to go as far as Kirkkonummi.
This will mean more costs for HSL, or in practice for the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
“We will now begin to look into different options and their effects on the service level and ticket prices”, said the CEO of HSL, Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is impossible to yet precisely estimate the costs.
Rihtniemi says that based ot the number of passengers, Y-train has cost about a million a year for HSL, but naturally much more to the ministry.
The prospective main line R-train will skip two stations.
Instead the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and a number of routes will stop across the country.
The ministry will stop buying train traffic services from the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to a Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Trains will be reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
There are over half a million journeys a year made on the reduced trains, as the total number of journeys in the traffic services purchased by the ministry is about nine millions.
The new contract is meant to save the state 12.3 million euros annually.
The annual contract value is about 27.5 million euros.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter for the book Pääoman ajankohtaisuus (the topicality of Capital): “Marx is worth reading up on”
The crises in the world economy have resurfaced Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his magnum opus, Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the Communist Party of Finland (SKP), in the book published today, Marxin Pääoman ajankohtaisuus (the topicality of Marx’s Capital).
“He is being taken more seriously now than in a long time”, Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s estimations about the development of capitalist economy, its globalisation and obtrusion even further to all aspects of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing importance of both monetary and imaginary capital have all been shown to be astonishingly visionary.
The book that is based on Capital seminars organised by Hakanen also has a professor of Aalto University on its list of writers: esteemed economy expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman says Marx is topical “now and forever”.
But surely the former CEO of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies is no Marxist?
Well, no.
On the telephone Korkman says that he does not think Marx is a topical economic thinker, but more an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays social sciences have become differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and a literature connoisseur.
“The common perception is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men”, begins Korkman.
It is true that Marx's prophecies were wildly wrong.
Even though Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he made too advanced deductions about the early stages of capitalism, contemplates Korkman.
But Korkman also sees some value in Marx’s radical stance.
“More relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions”, he says.
Now there is again discussion about things like wealth distribution that was also an interest of Marx.
“Marx can perhaps inspire someone, who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing because of a technical revolution”, analyses Korkman.
But Marx will not help with tomorrow’s government decisions.
According to him, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be ceased.
But Korkman still thinks Marx is worth reading up on.
“It was impossible to read Marx in the 1970s”, says Korkman.
“Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but they hated each other even more.”
Now the discussion is more diverse, and it is possible to approach also Marx without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
“Every social scientist should read up on Marx’s ideologies - just like all the other classics, too”, says Korkman.
UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka to be judged
UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate the war crimes committed in Sri Lanka’s civil war, reports press office AFP.
The UN report on the civil war of 1983-2009 was unveiled on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the security forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels, known as Tamil Tigers, of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the civil war.
There is no accurate information on the number of the victims.
The UN report calls for proper investigation of especially the armed forces’ great assault during the last months of the long war in 2009.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan security forces of torture, kidnappings and systematic sexual abuse targeted men as likely as women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing outsiders and children to fight.
Both sides have committed murders, states the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it is going to organise an investigation, but not going to allow UN to establish a special court, because of the foreign judges.
Social media was weighed in the matriculation examination for English
The Wednesday's test in this autumn's matriculation examination was advanced foreign language, which for most is English.
There were over 16,000 candidates testing their skills in English.
One topic for the essay part of the test was social media.
The candidate was supposed to consider, based on their own experiences, whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Another option was to write a text of 150-200 words addressed to a person writing an online advice column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is equivalent to Finnish Leelian lepotuoli.
She was the one to ask advice about how to make parents see things also from the point of view of the young people.
There were altogether four topics, one of which had to be chosen.
“This was the most difficult”, estimated Mia Lybeck, lecturer in English from Porvoo Swedish-speaking upper secondary school, about the third topic.
The third topic only included a citation from the former President of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was quite nice.
For that, the candidate had to write a spiel about why companies should hire young people to work for them.
“At least in our school we have practised speech writing”, Lybeck says and estimates that the test was “quite normal”.
The questions about texts contemplating for example the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change or handling large amounts of data could be answered in Finnish - or Swedish.
There were also some who took part in tests for advanced Russian (168 candidates), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn matriculation exams continue on Friday, when the test in the second national language, Swedish or Finnish, is organised.
The test is organised normally in upper secondary schools, so the employees’ demonstration has no effect on it.
The matriculation examination board urges the candidates to find suitable traffic connections so that they arrive on time to the test.
It is also possible to have extra time, if the candidate is able to prove that their tardiness was not caused by their own negligence.
A shop was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu
A shop was robbed on Wednesday morning in Kello district of Oulu.
According to the police, the robbed wore dark clothes and had covered his face with a balaclava.
The man is of average height and weight, and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the shop staff with a hand gun and managed to take a small sum of money.
The matter is being investigated as an aggravated robbery.
The police is preparing to receive tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland.
The demonstration against the Government’s cut decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police forecast.
According to advance information, there can be even tens of thousands of people present.
The members of SAK, Akava and STTK meet on Helsinki Railway Square at 11 o’clock.
Also police officers are expected to take part in the demonstration.
Those officers in duty are tasked with not only taking care of the emergencies and other police activities, but also securing the progress of the demonstration.
The streets leading to Railway Square are closed from motorised vehicles between about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From Hakaniemi direction the traffic is cut off from Kaisaniemi roundabout, from western direction beginning from Mannerheimintie.
Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala, will Helsinki Police department have enough staff?
For now it seems that we do.
I do not take a stand on the police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols from the rest of the country will come to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The police do not divulge precise patrol numbers.
“There are some coming, but as a main rule, we can manage on our own”, Kujala says.
The police urges people to avoid private car use in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam stretches from Hakaniemi to the nuclear centre.
Traffic standstills are to be expected from morning until the early evening.
There are also many charter coaches arriving to Helsinki thanks to demonstrators from other parts of Finland.
These will not be allowed in the Railway Square.
In principle, the coaches terminate quite far.
The rest of the journey to the demonstration place has to be on foot, then”, says Kujala.
The demonstration also cuts off the public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view this also has a positive side.
The problem with public transport flow that normally has to be considered in these kinds of crowd meetings will now partly take care of itself.
The demonstration organisers have notified the police that there can be tens of thousands of demonstrators opposing the Government’s economic policy arriving to Helsinki.
Police expects the demonstration to progress peacefully.
“The people are ordinary employed or unemployed citizens.
Finnish people are sensible and calm”, says Kujala.
There are also local demonstrations organised around Finland on Friday.
The demonstration on Friday is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration on Friday organised by trade unions is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For instance, it does not have a very good reference in Finnish political history, says sociology professor emeritus Martti Siisiäinen from University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade unions are protesting.
If they would not, they would be just putting their arms up in front of the government, says Siisiäinen.
The very right-winger government has struck to the central points of Finnish traditional corporatism - and also to those points that have been essential to the development of Finnish welfare state.
The government’s hard measures interfere with contract law.
There are many characteristics that indeed point in the direction that this is an attempt to bring the trade unions to their knees.
At the same time, the trade unions should take a look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed for instance for the fact that the trade unions are far from having all the employees’ support for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new is the strict polarisation the demonstration creates in that group the trade unions would like to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed from across Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If we are looking for a comparison for Friday’s demonstration, one such could be found in the mega demonstration of the unemployed, the so-called Turning Point Thursday of 1993, says Siisiäinen.
The demonstration, organised during the worst recession, brought together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho's (Centre Party) government struggled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never been as bad as during Aho's right-wing government.
Now the relationship between the government and the trade unions is maybe even worse than during the Turning Point Thursday.
And besides, Finland’s current government is the most right-wing ever, says Siisiäinen.
The current government coalition is interesting also in that way that it is so strictly right-wing, despite what the True Finns say.
During their election success of 2011, the party still had elements from the old labour movement.
Thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops parts of public traffic, and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.
Even though the demonstratin does not have the undivided support of the employees, it can be the biggest in years.
In recent years, there have been about 300 demonstrations every year in Helsinki.
There are all kinds of topics.
Traditionally Finnish trade unions’ demonstrations have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have become harder in recent years.
Traditionally one avoids conflict and is law-abiding in a Finnish demonstration.
The demonstrators try to avoid damaging or destroying propers, says Siisiäinen.
The end of the 1990s brought new impetus, though.
The demonstration culture was changed.
The EU membership ruffled the farmers enough to make them hurl chicken eggs, and the police prepared for thrown pig shit.
The firemen strike of 1998 lasted for three months.
Also for example pilots and air traffic controllers had arresting strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electricity strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike of 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike of 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the strike.
The reconciliation board’s proposal ended the strike after it had lasted 7 weeks.
The metal workers got a 16 percent raise.
The electricity strike of spring 1977 lasted 49 days and caused power cuts around the country.
Turning Point Thursday in 1993
About 20,000 people, many of them unemployed because of the recession, gathered in front of the Parliamentary House on 4th November, 1993, to demonstrate for work.
The firemen were on strike for three months in 1998
The firemen strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike in the 1990s.
The farmers protested against EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in an egg rain, as the farmers protested agains EU in 1994.
“Learn the hard way, EU finishes”, is a translation of one of the slogans.
The farmers dumped tons of snow on Esplanadi.
Also the Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 moved the farmers to protest and burn bales of hay in front of the summit venue.
The nurses were on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
Previously they had been on strike in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was shaded by a few of deaths that happened during the strike.
The Union of Health and Social Care Professionals (Tehy) threatened with a strike and nurses’ mass resignations in 2007.
The threat of mass resignations finally speeded up the negotiations to reach an outcome.
The doctors were on strike in 2001
“Doctors forced to strike”, is a translation of the doctors’ strike slogan in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about 5 months and gave rise to discussion about how strikes can compromise patient safety.
After the strike the public sector gave doctors a raise.
The students were on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for student allowance in Helsinki, from the Senate Square to the Parliamentary House, in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police is investigating the background of the Finnish truck full of refugees for Austrian police
Austrian police has asked the Central Criminal Police to help in investigating the background of the Finnish-registered refugee truck.
On Sunday, Austrian police halted a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim near the German border.
There is no information whether the truck was possible on its way to Finland.
Those aboard the refrigerated truck are all in good condition.
We have exchanged information with Austrian police.
The investigation is conducted and the main responsibility is in Austria, the location where this happened, says chief inspector Tero Haapala from the Central Criminal Police.
Other refugees travelling aboard a truck in Austria had worse luck.
Then all 71 passengers apparently asphyxiated.
According to Yleisradio, who first reported the cooperation with Austrian police, the truck is owned by a Finnish limited company.
The company practices for instance catering and has a person of foreign origin, a man of about 40 years, as its managing director.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human smuggling.
A refugee-beating captain, an ex-drug courier and an enormously rich business man - the story of five smugglers
An enormously rich king of the smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary a taxi driver who thinks he is a good guy.
These are an example of people practising human smuggling to European Union.
Criminologist working in the University of Trento, Andrea Di Nicola, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their “clients”, and a book called Kuoleman matkatoimisto (Travel Agency of Death) they wrote is published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present some of the tentacles of human smuggling, suggest possible solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of the trade.
HS introduces five of them.
I’ll beat them in their place immediately
Kerkennah Island off the east coast of Tunisia are no attraction for foreign tourists, but for many Tunisians, they are a place to spend the summer.
As to their location, the islands are an excellent place also for smuggling, because the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres.
As a comparison: the distance between Helsinki and Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir - a chain-smoker captain and a father of six.
Kerkennah Islands are famous for their prawns, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
And that is what Emir has done with his blue, 10-metre, wooden boat for already hundreds of times.
If you cram the boat, you can fit 40 people in it.
After expenses, Emir makes about 8,000 euros for one trip.
Emir has five assistants who search customers for him from all over Tunisia.
The customers come from many different countries, but during the Arab Spring, a vast number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that the situation quietened down, until it was rekindled along with the refugee crisis.
The customers come in small groups from the continent to Kerkennah Islands.
Emir houses them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such quantities as to keep the customers barely alive.
Housing costs around 75 euros per night, and if a customer runs out of money, it is their problem.
The boat leaves at midnight with headlights off.
First night they leave the islands, then they stop, wait for a day and go to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes there are rough seas, and when the waves are 20 metres high, the passenger cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in a half an hour and Emir can return.
Emir wants to be feared.
That is why he beats his customers and, at least allegedly, beats those who oppose him to death.
In the book he tells that once when the police spotted him, he through all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I grabbed the customers by their necks, one by one, and threw them overboard”, Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from sub-Saharan Africa.
He says he must beat his own countrymen time after time.
I’ll beat them in their place immediately.
They must be shown who’s the boss here right away.
Just another taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the start engine is already on its last legs, and the whole car has seen better days.
The most important thing for Goran’s customers, however, is the fact the car is moving in the first place, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometres south-west from Belgrad.
Right next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mostly families are admitted.
In the woods surrounding the centre, there are men travelling without their families, taking a room in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars - whatever they have managed to find or build.
The woods also house families that, for one reason or another, have not lodged asylum applications to Serbia.
Some are also housed in private apartments, but that is an open secret.
It is among these forest-dwellers that Goran finds most of his customers.
They are often weary - the route via the Balkans includes a great number of border crossings and they have to walk for weeks across difficult terrain, often in the mountains and in the dark.
When they finally reach Bogovaða area, the great node for human smuggling, the people are exhausted.
Goran’s customers are mainly Syrian, Afghanistani, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurd.
The Syrian are the best customers, he tells in the book.
“They say what they have to say once and that is enough”, Goran commends.
According to him, the Africans try to haggle.
Goran doesn’t like that.
It’s blah blah blah the whole journey.
First we agree on for example 300 euros, then they lower it to 200, and finally they offer 150.
Goran emphasises that he is a nice man with a good heart.
I am not interested in money.
“I just do my work and help people”, he says in the book.
Goran says that he does this for less money than the others, and that he only takes 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 300 kilometres, most of it comfortably along the motorway.
Allegedly his colleagues ask for triple or quadruple the price.
Goran makes about 50,000 euros a year.
For a smuggler that is not a huge sum, but in Serbia it is a rather comfortable annual income.
Serbia has decreed that taxis are not allowed to drive the migrants nearer than within 12 kilometres to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about that: he knows the routes and shortcuts, and takes his passengers within a kilometre from the border.
Then he points the customers to the right direction and drives away.
Acts of kindness
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and that is not just a nick name.
He really has a protestant church in the Ugandan capital Kampala, where lots of believers that have fled from Congo come to, and a small centre, where Congolese child refugees find help.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary has a smuggling business that moves people from Congo to Europe.
He sees this as an act of kindness.
For the Missionary, it is important to look good.
He has his shoes shined many times a day and takes care that the rubber band of his white underpants can be stylishly seen from under the low waistline of his jeans.
The Missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his ATV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary is not preaching, he is organising people from Congo to Uganda and onwards to Europe.
First a customer calls one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that you should be on the border in the morning, hide your money carefully and slip among the vendors crossing the border.
In order to reach the status of an asylum seeker or a refugee, you have to tell the Ugandan officials that you are originally from for example the warzone of northern Kivu, and that you have had to flee your home because of the violence.
Most of the time it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary will organise a new identity for his customer.
You get rid of the old identification card and get a new one to replace it.
The Missionary’s contacts in the Ugandan police help in this.
After this the customer is directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go to: to the asylum procedure, to non-governmental organisations, finally to UN refugee organisation UNHCR.
The Missionary knows the red tape, because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges separately for each step: making an application to the Ugandan police is about 100 euros, delivering your papers to a humanitarian organisation around 150 and migration process for example to an European country from 4,500 to 7,000 euros.
Aluminium foil and icecubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, an ex drug courier.
The Irishman in his forties is on call in Calais on the French coast, where his job is to load people to lorries on their way to Great Britain.
To help him, there is an Afghanistani living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of lorry drivers, who do not necessarily even know they are involved in human smuggling business.
In the night Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2 or 3 people, from somewhere around the centre of Calais.
The drive the motorway A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car in the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
Tom doesn’t want that, he has already done seven years for drugs.
The taxi pulls over, Tom and his customers run over the motorway to a lay-by where the drivers sleep before continuing over the Channel to Britain.
Tom selects a suitable lorry - you have to make sure that it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts the safety cable of the tarpaulin.
You have to be quiet in order to not wake up the drivers.
Sometime the driver is in on the plot, but the it’s more expensive.
When the way is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminium foil, the same kind that is used in the kitchen to wrap around a roast or a jacket potato.
That should prevent the police’s heat scanner from finding the hideaway.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice cubes for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers to the lorry and leaves the place hoping that the driver doesn’t notice the stowaways at least until they reach Britain.
The king of the smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The enormously rich Turk has been called a master of marketing and an undeniable king of Mediterranean illegal landings. He controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly to Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s, and he has continually developed new methods for smuggling.
He also has a certain competitive edge compered to other entrepreneurs: he demands the money at the destination.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: luxury yachts are hired from Turkish harbours as if to take American or European families to pleasant tourist cruises for a couple of days.
In reality, the yachts are crammed with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghanis, who are transported for a fee of 5,000 to 7,000 euros first from Istanbul overland to a harbour, and from there to Europe by sea.
Customers are kept in human storehouses, for instance in old industrial halls, until it is their time to go.
They are crammed into minibuses and taken to someplace on the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and to wait for a signal.
When it is given, the ship has to be boarded quickly
The customers have to stay hidden under the deck for the whole journey.
The coast guard can only monitor the draft of the ship, since that might be the only sign of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less the passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
After expenses, Küçük receives about 53,000 euros from a luxury yacht trip.
He does not take care of the practicalities, but hires the captains, recruiters, guards, housing organisers and other less important persons to take care of the work for him.
In the summer season there are at least hundreds of journeys, and Küçük makes millions.
It is believed that via a front-company, he has bought land, a pharmaceutical firm and over a hundred apartments he rents out.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same with a Turkey’s Democratic Party’s representative and a certain pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that it seems that he has disappeared.

American Olympic runner tells about her illness and becoming a prostitute in her book
Three-time Olympian 1500 metre runner Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about how she quit her career and ended up as an escort.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended her career in Sydney Olympics.
She took part in the competition in top shape and ran the second fastest time in the qualifications.
In the finals she panicked, though.
Right in the beginning she ran to the lead and defended her position running like a maniac.
150 metres before the goal her strength ran out, however.
She fell to the track and other runners passed her one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I will never run again.
I forced myself to cross the goal line, says Favor Hamilton in her book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
Her brother Dan had committed a suicide a year before Sydney Olympics, and she was under terrible pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was intrigued by the idea of receiving money from having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to approve her actions.
Favor Hamilton’s rate was 450 euros per hour.
She says she used the money in luxury life.
One Favor Hamilton’s explanation for becoming a prostitute was the fact she missed the same adrenaline spikes she had while competing.
Later Favor Hamilton found out that she had bipolar disorder.
The former star athlete’s double life was exposed in the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun published an article about her.
Favor Hamilton participated in three Olympiads: Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000 she was number on in the statistics for 1500 metres, her time being 3.57,40, but she was the last in Sydney Olympic finals.
The world champion rejoiced as the union disciplined Norwegian ski-rooster: “That's upright”
The ski king of Norway, Petter Northug, has crossed the border of propriety, at least in one of his colleagues’ books.
Northug and Norway’s national ski federation have discussed his athlete agreement through the whole summer and autumn, just like last year.
Even though the federation has offered Northug a better deal than for the other athletes, even that has not been enough for this multiple world champion and Olympic gold medal winner.
As a result of this deal disagreement, the ski federation of Norway decided to drop Northug from the next season’s World Cup.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
She said she is happy the federation decided to discipline the ski rooster.
“Thank you for showing some backbone”, Jacobsen wrote on her Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow for one active athlete to be exempt from working for the federation’s sponsor”, she continued.
The argument between the ski federation of Norway and Northug is about money.
It seems that Northug would like to be away from the national team for part of the season in order to be able to promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said she is also happy to represent a federation that takes care also of the future generations and does not let one athlete to play solo.
At the same time she reminded people that the federation has given Northug both economic as well other privileges for several years.
I know this, because I have been part of the system.
Jacobsen does not approve of one athlete having a whole different set of rules just because he is the best.
On Tuesday Northug published his own announcement ensuring that he wants to represent in Norway’s colours also next season in the World Cup, as well as in the World Championship and the Olympics after that.
During her career, Astrid Jacobsen won all in all six World Championship medals, two of them golden.
Last winter she was part of the team that won gold for relay in Falun.
La Confrérie de la Chaîne des Rôtisseurs Finlande, Paistinkääntäjät, celebrates World Chaîne Day also in Ostrobothnia
On the World Chaîne Day, 25th September, there are events in different restaurants and shops that have been granted the professional Rôtisseurs Finlande plaque.
The goal of the day is to promote the high-level gastronomical skills in Finland and to make it easier to go to a restaurant, as well as to increase the information about the significance of the plaque as part of high quality.
At the same time, the objective is to remind people that not all quality restaurants are centred in the metropolitan area, but there are top restaurants inspected and classified by an independent operator across Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a sign about its significance as part of making the plaque restaurants and the organisation better known.
In Ostrobothnia, the event is organised in Vaasa, in restaurants Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, Vanhankaupungin ravintola takes part in the event.
The event has been noticed internationally, as well.
It has been decided that the event will be one of the most important international events of the organisation, and that it will be organised around the world on the same day.
Finland will still be the host country of the world.
Kauhajoki newspaper: A complaint to Chancellor of Justice has been filed about establishing a reception centre to Kauhava
The Finnish Immigration Service and Finnish Red Cross work in cooperation to establish a refugee reception centre to Kauhava garrison’s ex-facilities, now owned by LSK Business Park.
The complaint states that there is still permanent infrastructure for time of crisis, and it is still in use by the National Defence Forces and its cooperation partner, State Security Networks Ltd.
Kauhajoki newspaper says that according to a private individual, locating the reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into consideration in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complaintive, the National Defence Force may have interests related to the previous area of Training Air Wing and the airfield, the effect of which has similarly not been considered while preparing the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The story states that as far as Kauhava airfield is concerned, during the last two years there have been discussions on organising flight education and on possible arrival of a foreign operator on the airfield.
The matter has also been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistä (True Finns) and Permanent Secretary from Ministry of Defence Arto Räty.
The private individual states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about opposing reception centres in principle, but about the location in the previous garrison area being wrong.
Kauhava town board discussed the reception centre matter on last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria reflects to Ukraine and to Baltic Sea region
The control means that the immigrants and those already here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to the reporters in the evening after meeting with all the leaders of the parliamentary parties at his residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concern over refugee situation control connected all the participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland both the ruling and the opposition parties can have a confidential discussion about fundamental questions.
Especially during these times we have great challenges in front of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria as well as the Russian and American actions in the region can have an effect also on the situation in Ukraine, and ultimately in the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is optimistic about the dialogue developing.
If the situation can progress positively, i.e. if the United States and Russia can, it will have an effect to the situation in Ukraine and further to the tense situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, Nato question was also touched upon in the discussions.
The president did not take a stand on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancel 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkos will be closed for a couple of hours
One flight is cancelled already on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights is available on Finnair website.
Finavia says it attempts to take care of the operations on airports with the managerial staff.
It can be expected that there will be rushes and delays in security checks and other service points.
Demonstration closes streets in central Helsinki
The Friday demonstration closes streets in central Helsinki.
The police says the streets leading to the Railway Square are closed from cars between 9.30-14.
From Mannerheimintie direction the cars are not allowed on Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Hakaniemi direction via Unioninkatu the traffic is directed to Unioninkatu from Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers in the demonstration the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers take part in the Friday’s demonstration from the beginning of the early morning traffic until the end of night traffic.
In the evening the association for metro and tram staff (Raitio- ja metrohenkilökunnan yhdistys) informed STT about the matter.
Most of the Alkos are closed for two hours, also some post offices are closed
The demonstration on Friday will also cause disruptions to Posti services.
Significant delays can be expected for example in day mail delivery.
Most of Posti service points will be closed.
Finnish Red Cross will take care of the blood deliveries despite of the strike.
Also meal deliveries as well as hospital deliveries and laboratory samples are being taken care of.
Topical information about the services is available on Posti website.
Most of Finnish Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Service Union United PAM has instructed employees to stop working between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
PAM has also advised people working in grocery shops to take part in the trade unions’ demonstration.
Representatives from SOK and Kesko said to Helsingin Sanomat that they attempt to keep the shops open with the managerial staff, if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet about the possible closing of individual shops.
Helsinki nurseries partly closed
Nurseries in Helsinki will not operate at their full capacity on Friday, informs Helsinki Department of Early Education and Care.
On account of the trade unions’ protest, day care is possibly concentrated to certain nurseries, and there will be no organised club activities in nurseries or playgrounds.
Round-the-clock nurseries and groups for intellectually and multiply disabled children will be open.
In addition, afternoon activities for intellectually disabled and autistic school children will be organised normally.
The Department of Early Education and Care promised to inform more about the operation changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
According to Sipilä, varied channels are needed in communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of a channel for direct speech will be needed in the future, too.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told the reporters in the parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how recurrent these premier’s speeches broadcasted through television and radio are going to be.
According to Sipilä, the speeches will not necessarily always be broadcast from Yle channels.
If there are other channels available, we will see then.
Tonight we are using this channel, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, situation of the Finnish economy is so dire that it requires to hold a broadcasted speech to the citizens.
This whole complex of issues currently in question is quite intricate and calls for a longer reasoning.
That is why we chose this channel, explained Sipilä.
The speech will be broadcast between 9.05 and 9.20 PM both via TV1 and Radio Suomi.
It is also available in Yle Areena.
Sipilä is taking a big risk
Media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech is not a symptom of the government’s more general turn inwards.
Is the goal to take the right to define public discussion more tightly in their own hands and to turn down the framing of questions in the public discussion? Anu Koivunen, a professor in the University of Stockholm contemplates.
This reminds me of the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment about how he will not follow the media’s agenda, nor will he let it define himself.
In the name of democratic discussion and publicity I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be odd, if the media would not react.
In a democracy, the political decision makers’ communicational styles are not something just to be announced.
It is the job of media representatives by definition to strive not to take politicians’ agendas as given.
According to Koivunen, a televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
Sipilä should introduce something new and special in his speech, in order to fulfill the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Are we going to get more of that what we have already heard?
Or is he able to adopt a different tone, different manner or different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if all there will be is just same old, we have to wonder the motivation behind this grand gesture and why Yle allocated exceptional time for it?
This is a risk for Yle, as well, in the sense that if this turns out to be not a special situation but just a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is labelled as a medium for politicians or the parliament or the government, which would most definitely not be in line with Yle's interests or general policy.
A smart move from Sipilä
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech important will also be what the Prime Minister leaves unsaid, emphasises the media researcher.
Research coordinator of University of Jyväskylä, Heikki Kuutti, says that one should pay special attention to what Sipilä discusses and what he will not.
According to Kuutti, a televised speech is a smart move from Sipilä, since this way he is able to highlight his own views without discordant notes.
This way the message has a large audience without any journalistic filters, unlike in a press conference, where journalists are able to ask critical questions.
Sipilä overrides the media and addresses the people directly.
The danger is that media interprets parts of the speech in a wrong way, since there is no possibility to ask further questions.
According to Kuutti it is vital how Sipilä presents himself in the television - is he sweating, are his hands shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure, who is now telling the people what to they need to do.
If Sipilä can put his points well, it can work.
The situation is different from one where the government would be informing the public, since this is more like one human being speaking to another.
This is what (the President of the United States Barack) Obama and associates do regularly.
Quite exceptional
Parliamentary researcher Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister’s speech to the citizens is quite exceptional.
According to him, it is something that has not taken place in decades - that the Prime Minister directly addresses the people.
Exceptional times require exceptional measures, Railo says.
The researcher believes that by acting this way, the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the tightenings that will come.
Employee associations will organise a demonstration on Friday and strikes against the government’s actions.
The Left Alliance leader Paavo Arhinmäki said via Twitter that Sipilä could make his speech about the situation of the nation also in the parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would allow for discussion.
The leader of the Social Democratic Party Antti Rinne declares that he will challenge Sipilä to a dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
It has been almost six months since the election.
One cannot hide for ever, Rinne writes via Twitter.
9-Year-old missing boy found at Tampere
On the time of recovery the boy was fine.
BOY FOUND AND OK, the father of the boy updated on his Facebook page.
Central Finland Police Department also confirmed this to Iltalehti.
The boy went outside to play around 4 o’clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening he could not be contacted anymore.
The father is grateful for all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens who contacted me and told about sightings.
The status update was shared almost 15,000 times, which is an amazing number for such a short period of time.
Finnish UFC start was disappointed with youn people’s violent fad: You create hate
The ultimate fighter with Kurdish origin, Makwan Amirkhani, published a video on Facebook on which he appeals to especially immigrant youn people.
Makwan Amirkhani gave an important speech against young people’s street fights.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and moved to Finland in the age of five with his family, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious ultimate fighting league UFC.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to check out one Instagram account.
There were uploaded videos of young people fighting with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with this fad of young people.
26-Year-old Amirkhani has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys are kicking those on the ground, sitting on top of someone and hitting frantically without any thoughts for consequences, what will happen when you do these kinds of videos, grieves Amirkhani.
Hard to make any more excuses
Some of the young people on the video are immigrants.
According to inspector of Helsinki police, Jarmo Heinonen, both immigrant and originally Finnish youn people have uploaded fighting videos to social media.
It’s especially that you are fighting on the street.
You are making lives of so many other immigrants so much more difficult here in Finland, complains Amirkhani, who lives in Turku.
Amirkhani reminds people that there are Finnish websites that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
There are seriously a lot of these individual cases.
It’s a bit hard to make up any more excuses, boys.
You should remember you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite some time.
This is a bit different way to say thank you for letting you stay here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges the young to remember the people close to them.
If they end up as target for someone's racism, you have to blame yourselves for that.
So guys, think and think again before you take part in that.
Amirkhani says that violent actions give ammunition to racism.
You create that kind of hate in me that I don’t like myself.
The things with you are already pretty bad and you are certainly not making them any better, Amirkhani concludes.
SAK sits on its view about the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly told on Twitter that the labour organisation will consider its opinion about STTK’s alternative savings list on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK proposal on Twitter.
The Finnish Confederation of Professionals STTK said earlier on Wednesday they are going to present the Government their own proposal, which would able to reach the five per cent productivity leap required by the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava President Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava all stand behind it.
That would require though that the biggest labour organisation SAK softens its earlier opinion.
As for SAK President Lauri Lyly, he commented the matter briefly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK work committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market lock”, and that instead of mandatory laws, what is needed are agreements between active parties.
Lyly reminds people that SAK did not accept Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for social contract.
Earlier Sipilä ended the discussions about social contract after SAK did not agree to commit itself to the goal of five per cent productivity leap.
Comment: Great demonstration at risk of flopping - “It does feel a bit funny to shake your fist”
It does feel a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood varies from side to side in the salary earners’ camp.
What is the goal, to shout the Government over or to settle with it?
On Monday the leaders of SAK were raging with righteous anger against the Government of the Republic.
They threatened to shut down whole Finland.
The bluster spread among Akava members, too.
The Trade Union of Education OAJ threatened to close schools and nurseries.
On Tuesday OAJ was cancelling: no schools or nurseries are completely closed.
On Wednesday the Chairman of Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees STTK, Antti Palola (Social Democrats), appeared in public in a placatory way.
He told he had been in contact with the Government and was drafting an alternative proposal for the five per cent productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava Presiden Sture Fjäder (Coalition) immediately rushed to inform that his reconciliation paper is already ready.
At first the SAK office did not utter a word.
It is hard for President Lauri Lyly (Social Democrats) to fraternise, as it was just on Monday the union leaders told to stop the country on Friday.
Finally Lyly did announce that SAK work committee will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market lock”.
In order to put together employees’ common proposal, SAK needs to give in and accept the five per cent productivity leap as a goal.
It is no wonder that Palola’s STTK has good relations to Sipilä’s government.
Palola’s right hand, STTK director of public affairs Jukka Ihanus used to be special adviser for the Central party prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola defines that the Government’s trade union knowledge has gotten better all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s outing did take some wind out the sails of those stopping Finland, the figurehead of which is AKT's Marko Piirainen (Social Democrats).
It does feel a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited 6.00 p.m.: Added information about Lyly’s comments.
Russia said Finland was a bad host: “This cannot happen again”
The Russian speaker of the lower house of parliament, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to Russian speaker of the lower house of the parliament, Sergei Naryshkin, said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The Autumn Meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has began in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where Naryshkin thoroughly commented on the Helsinki anniversary meeting in July.
Finland did not allow the Russian politicians, like Naryshkin, who had ended on the European Union blacklist to take part in the meeting - a matter the speaker continued to remind the reporters about.
According to our estimation, this was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This cannot happen again, emphasised Naryshkin according to news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin also criticised the United States, who also banned him from entering the country.
The sanctions are a political suicide for EU, declared Naryshkin.
The Russian delegation had no problems entering Mongolia, so Naryshkin continued to snipe at Finland by complimenting and acknowledging Mongolia for its “excellent organising”.
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will be constructive and have positive results, unlike the July summit in Helsinki.
Mongolian leadership understand that there are supposed to be no obstacles for parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva (Coalition), who conducts the meeting in Ulaanbaatar and, accordin to Russian media, has already had discussions with the Russian delegation.
Lukko is about to meet a true playoff monster: “Goals will be tight”
Tappara and Lukko continue their hard work in Hakametsä today, when both teams are under fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real scoring party in Hakametsä today.
Tappara visited Kuopio yesterday and drilled a 3-2 extra time win over KalPa.
That was a manly climb, since the last season’s silver team was lagging two goals behind at the worst.
For Lukko, Tuesday was played in more of a minor key.
The Rauma team caught zero points from a visit to Blues who had a sluggish start, with the numbers of the defeat also being 2-3.
Hard game, tough to score, if they play the same type of game than last year, predicted Lukko forward Janne Lahti on the team's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare to the team from Rauma.
During the two previous seasons it has been exactly Tappara who has won Lukko and progressed to the finals.
Both time this has required a determining seventh game.
Last season Lukko had three wins before the fourth game, but in the next three, Tappara first came square with Lukko and then went past it.
There are no big changes in the line-ups of the teams, except goalkeepers.
Both teams’ goalies were on duty yesterday and can rest today.
Mika Noronen from Tappara’s goal makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski between Lukko’s goalposts.
Point of view: A lousy play underway in Ässät
Sports Director Toivola scripted a sequel unsuitable for Head Coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a script to Rocky, in which he starred himself.
Sensationally the underdog stood up to heavyweight world champion, Apollo Creed.
Even though he lost the title match, Rocky evoked great sympathy.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola scripted a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
The nameless and wooden-handed bunch of spades surprised everyone by advancing to the season finals in 2006.
The team was full of Rocky-like nameless but tenacious underdogs.
Valkoinen intiaani, Porin Matti and Pele Peltonen were some of the names.
For the playoffs, the players dyed their hair red and cut it to a Mohawk hairdo.
Toivola turned blonde.
An excellent TV commentator JP Jalo named the coach Neumann.
Ässät won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The scriptwriter Toivola believes that this season's new work will function the same way as ten years ago.
Working as a Sports director for Ässät, he has built the spade deck on a foundation of bd bois.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have thrashed blokes in the rink like Rocky thrashed pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen all have their merits outside puck handling.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, main part is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Rautakallio Sean Connery.
In Toivola’s script of Rocky, Rautakallio is as clumsy a protagonist as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There is nothing Rocky in Rautakallio besides his nickname.
Rautakallio’s game philosophy does not include rushing or minor clamouring.
He values hard play, but playing hard is different than playing dirty.
Last season, Garret Stafford from Ässät checked Jere Karjalainen from Tappara to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the referees, but Rautakallio removed him from the play.
He did not merit one minute!
Only those that deserve it are allowed to play.
I do not approve that kind of play, and it is not part of team Ässät hockey, snarled Rautakallio annoyed after the game for Satakunnan Kansa.
The Ässät team for the season is weirdly constructed.
There are juniors, veterans, police and those who rush into things.
There are practically no key players in their prime.
It is no wonder then that the Head Coach has complained about the lack of skills.
How much have you been able to affect the player selections, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect the selection and, unfortunately, the situation at the player market was quite limited, Rautakallio answes diplomatically.
Simmering beneath the surface.
Rautakallio, a 1953 model, is, as far as is known, interested in transferring to Toivola's post as a Sports Director.
Both the men’s contracts end this spring.
The team's balance in three league matches has been the same number of defeats, with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should have opted out of writing the script for the sequel.
Olga Temonen to play Sipe Santapukki’s mother
Olga Temonen reveals tha if she had met his husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting under his husband’s direction for the first time.
Yes, in the film I will play the role of my husband’s friend’s mother.
In a way it feels crazy, laughs actor and producer Olga Temonen.
She has been married to the Apulanta ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
Previously, the couple has often worked together, too, but this is the first time Olga will act under Tuukka’s direction.
Her role in the film protraying the early years of Apulanta, Teit meistä kauniin, is drummer Sipe Santapukki’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka encourages and supports his son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have come to know my real role model Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
She is a great person and I am grateful for Tuukka for entrusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirkka already before the film project, but after that the pair has become considerably closer.
They have met, talked in the telephone and sent messages.
Sirkka has been a great help.
We have gone through their history from different angles.
Sirkka luckily also understands that drama is drama and the truth might have to be coloured in a bit.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola to blindly believe that Apulanta will be the biggest band in Finland.
It was the recession in the 90s and living was really bleak.
The probability for someone to really make it is pretty slight, but Sirkka had some kind of an intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells that she had heard a lot of stories from Tuukka’s adolescence already before the film plans.
The parents’ stories have at times been slightly different, though.
Well, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, how much will your parents really know about what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own adolescence was complitely different from Tuukka’s, who was known as the infamous skater from Heinola.
Olga was an ordinary and good girl, who would have had nothing to do with the Tuukka from the film.
At most she could have secretly taken to him.
According to Olga, she has cooperated so much with Tuukka during a decade that a big project together does not scare her.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the whole production crew will spend a month in Heinola filming.
The couple who live in Iitti will, however, often drive back home to spend the night with their small children, as the distance is not too great.
We are taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us really warmly, just asking which streets should be emptied and when.
Iron Sky 2 is now the most expensive non-animated Finnish film
The budget for Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
The shooting of the film will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins shooting Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel for the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race will be the most expensive non-animated film production in Finland with its 17 million euro budget.
Previously it was Jalmari Helander’s Big Game that had the title for the most expensive film in Finland.
Also the Angry Birds animation currently in preparation will rise past Iron Sky 2 when it is finished, since the budget for the film is over a 100 million euros.
The shooting of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, begins in October in AED Studios’ facility near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium already next week.
I’m not afraid of the huge budget.
I've been really amazingly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script, since I know exactly what the film should be like.
Everybody in the work group seem to realise we are doing something incredible-
It awesome to go to Belgium.
Even though we’ve a tight schedule, I’ve no fear.
I more excited, and can’t wait to be able to show this movie to the public, he told to Iltalehti.
Originally the budget of the film was supposed to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, so did the budget.
The budget is big, but so is the story.
I could put 100 million into this film, because every camera angle and special effect cost so much.
Now everything is so tight that there is no slack anywhere.
Today, on Wednesday, the production company of the film, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and bonds with an annual interest of 4 to 8 per cent.
The final interest depends on the supply and demand during the campaign.
The company will repay the loan after two years the latest.
The action film stars for example Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Dork or cool?
Big logos make a return to shirts
Lately trendsetters’ shirt fronts have been decorated by big logos.
A while ago a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like they avoided Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen somewhat rustic.
But times, they are a-changing.
Sportiness has been a real mega trend in fashion, and that means also old familiar sport fashion brands like Adidas and Nike have risen to the crest of the cool wave.
And like so many times before, the line between funny and trendy is fine: if something is very bumpkinish, it will start to change into ironic and cool.
First came norm core trend, or regular fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as if as a way to separate themselves from the masses.
Now, instead of a basic grey sweatshirts they wear the sweats that were already buried in the bottom of the wardrobe and that have a brand logo in front of them.
The bigger and more traditional the better.
In addition to logos, also for example the recognisable Adidas stripes, jerseys of your favourite team and New York Yankees baseball caps have made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos in underwear peaking from under the edge of jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sport brands also to luxury brands.
For example the chest of Versace's autumn shirts makes the brand of the garment quite obvious.
Would you be prepared to showcase logos in your clothing?
Russian politician published proof: I did not get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
Allegedly this unusual incident happened in Nizhny Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held, presenting products of Russian war industry.
Over the last few days, the Russian media have spread colourful claims stating Russian Emergency Situations Ministry had to work five hours releasing sizeable Zotov from the tank hatch.
Later Zotov has made all the effort to deny the information.
He even published a photo on his own, public Facebook page, showing him peeking from the armoured vehicle in a rather good mood, and at least according to these pictures, he did not get stuck or angry.
Complete nonsense.
Let us start with me not going inside a battle tank, since it was an infantry fighting vehicle BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, lieutenant colonel, I have served in Ural.
I went inside, took a look around and calmly exited, Zatov stated to Komsomolskaya Pravda.
I did not get stuck and I most definitely did not spend five hours in that position, he said.
To Russian army’s TV channel Zotov explained that he was admiring Russian new technology in the expo, since he is a former regular himself.
That is why I was interested what is inside the vehicles, I was admiring our technology.
And I exited through the rear hatch, he said.
I visited all the tanks.
And I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the infantry fighting vehicles also in the next expo, promised Zotov.
Zotov also called the journalist writing about the matter an idiot.
One idiot wrote, everyone else repeated.
No such thing happened.
I went in, and I came out.
I am tall and robust, but nothing like me getting stuck in a tank did not happen, he said to radio Russkaya sluzhba novostei.
Zotov’s claims are supported by the fact that there are no published photos about the alleged incident, even though a total of 50.000 people visited the arms expo during a few days.
The claim about Zotov getting stuck originated from a story on Bloknot.ru website, where it was described that Zotov struggled trying to get out of the tank hatch, finally threatening to shoot everyone around him, unless he can escape.
Later Bloknot published a sequel story, in hwich the expo organisers share their own view about what happened.
Everybody is just used to seeing soldiers quickly jumping out of armoured vehicles.
But due to his large size, parliamentarian Zotov simply took his time coming out.
But under no circumstances did he sit there for five hours, said the expo coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevskiy to Bloknot.

A leakage in Kittilä mine operated by a Canadian-based mining company Agnico Eagle Finland
The gold mine’s treated process water has been leaking from the so called tailing pond to a trench.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have been taken.
The pond contains neutralised ore-processing sand and treated process water from the flotation process.
Usually the water is either pumped to be used again as a process water or conveyed through an overland flow field to the environment, as specified in the permit.
The leakage was about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was discovered.
According to the company, the leak water quality complies with the current permit conditions.
Other materials did not leak to the environment.
The leak was discovered during an inspection round on Monday morning.
There are no observed structural damages to the dam structures of the pond.
The company says they are working in close co-operation with the officials to follow and repair the situation.
The mine amploys about six hundred regular workers.
Danske’s Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against too many cuts
Today the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its country report for Finland, and it is mainly in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to apply comprehensive structural reforms in order to overcome economic problems.
According to IMF, reducing overtime compensations and paid days off would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms are needed in the whole agreement system and in unemployment benefits.
According to Danske Bank chief economist, Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is a consensus on structural reforms, but also some differences.
There are many approving messages for the government’s actions in the IMF report, but also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, investments on infrastructure, Kuoppamäki told to Taloussanomat.
IMF considers that also the growth projects should be executed as quickly as possible, so that they would support weak economic growth.
For this year, IMF forecast for Finland is 0.4 per cent economic growth, which is expected to rise to 0.9 per cent the next year.
In their new economic outlook, Danske expects the growth this year will remain at zero per cent.
IMF is slightly more optimistic about this year.
They might have used recent observations as their basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was slightly growing during the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
It is possible that the so called softer indicators, like for example decreased confidence in industry, have not been paid so much attention to.
The difference is, however, only some decimals of a per cent.
Nintendo recovering from a death, names a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima worked under Satoru Iwata, passed away in July because of cancer, and now starts in his new job on Wednesday, Nintendo announced on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002, and he was a popular and charismatic figure in the gaming industry.
Iwata was responsible for example launching the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were part of the speculation as to possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata’s steps, estimates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda to Reuters.
Leading Nintendo strongly to mobile gaming is seen as Kimishima’s task, but in a way that it does not diminish the livelihood of the traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers come to Finland alone
Swedish immigration service confessed already in February 2015 that hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear every year.
This was reported by for instance SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their websites. According to Swedish immigration service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year in the country.
Senior Inspector Juha Kannelmaa from the Finnish Immigration Service describes the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the situation in Finland the same?
How many applicants disappear “underground” every year? - In 2013 there was a total of 156 asylum applications of underage children who arrived alone.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014 there were 196 such applications, and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
In the background of a disappearance can be that when the case is ongoing it is found out that the applicant is already registered in some other country applying Dublin regulation and that the applicant might have been discovered to be of age there.
Then it might be more appealing to an applicant to disappear than to continue with the case in Finland and to face refoulement to the country responsible for the application processing.
In proportion, part of those who disappeared are also found later, when they apply for an asylum in some other member country.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3,651, of which 134 applications were dropped on account of the applicant most likely had moved away from Finland, so a total of 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared last year, he says.
Are the numbers growing?
This year by 6 September we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from underage children arriving alone.
There are no total statistics yet of underage asylum seekers who have disappeared this year, but the number of underage applicants is known and it has clearly grown, which most likely will also have an effect on the number of disappearances, she emphasises.
What happens to those who receive a decision of deportation?
Are some of them lost for example to “grey labour market”?
This is a difficult thing for the Immigration Services to estimate, since deportation implementation is a responsibility of the police, stresses Kannelmaa.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Coalition) has been worried about the growing number of unregistered people coming to the country.
He has taken steps in this regard.
Orpo, who considered the refugee question in the meeting of European interior ministers, on Monday shared some practical actions about how to manage the flow of refugees via Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A.’s studio online - see the pictures from the equipment
The equipment used in TV and radio productions of the pioneer in the field of media, Timo T.A. Mikkonen, who lost his ability to work because of seizures, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's partner Nina Mikkonen is selling the equipment, once cutting-edge among the professionals of the field, at Huuto.net.
Online magazine Iltamakasiini was the first to tell about the online ad.
Today most of the equipment has fell behind with the technoloical development.
Nobody in the world of digital media films television programmes on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still trustful that there will be interested buyers.
Obviously the equipment is not up-to-date like that, but these will also be needed as long as there exists such material from the old generation that has to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and those building their own studio, said Nina Mikkonen to IS.
The reason for sale is that Mikkonens tryi to move out from their current home in Myrskylä.
There is no way we can take all these things with us.
Little by little I have started doing an inventory to see, what things we are going to give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen
We do not use these TV and radio devices ourselves anymore.
After the cerebral infarctions earlier it is clear that this man with a long career will not return to working life anymore.
Nina Mikkonen notes that they are only selling things and equipment now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life's work was archived already in the summer in the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives picked up boxes full of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic jams most likely worse than expected: Metro and trams could stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers decide today whether they widen their actions relating to Friday’s protest.
The original plan was to halt metro and train traffic only during the protest to be organised on Friday.
Whether the traffic will stop for the whole day will be decided during the afternoon.
Chief Shop Steward Pekka Hirvonen says the bluster in the field is great.
The cuts in night and shift pay sting the drivers badly, so the Government’s plans about pay cuts cause opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that halting the traffic for the whole day is a kind of a dilemma.
If metro and trams stop for Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area is practically all but halted.
According to VR information, there are no train service on Friday between 6 o’clock in the morning and 6 in the evening.
There will be no short-haul or long-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains that leave before six in the morning will be driven to their destination.
According to HSL, most of the buses will stay at the depot.
The members of AKT will be absent from work from Friday morning 3 o’clock until Saturday morning 3 o’clock.
Most likely a small number of bus lines can be driven with managerial staff, estimates HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL cannot yet say for certain which buses will be operating on Friday.
The employee organisations ore organising a big demonstration on Helsinki Railway Square on Friday between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police has used tear gas against hundreds of refugees.
According to the news agency AP, the incident took place on Hungary's border with Serbia, where many refugees attempt to cross to Europe.
Sky News says refugees attempted to break through a fence.
Refugees, many of which were women and children, took flight in a panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police also allegedly used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested in Texas school - teacher thought a self-made clock a bomb
A 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested in Texas, United States, after a teacher thought the self-made clock he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to demonstrate a result of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the clock looked exactly like a bomb.
The police were called in and the situation finally ended in the boy being taken in handcuffs to juvenile detention.
At no stage has Muhamed claimed anything else besides that he made a clock.
It is still possible that the boy is charged with making a hoax bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police stated the clock looked like a “movie bomb”.
The police has the clock, but as far as is known, it contained a circuit board and a digital display with wires in between.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with a three-day suspension from school.
His father is furious about the incident, and the country’s Council of American-Islamic Relations is wondering, whether the case is yet another display of islamophobia in the United States.
Britannia making a fuss over a Labour leader declining to sing the national anthem
The song lyrics ask God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn opposes the monarchy.
The criticism by the press, leaning towards right, has been agreed with MPs also from Corbyn’s own Labour party.
This has offended the people, suspected Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview by BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined in in the singing.
The memorial service yesterday was held to honour the RAF pilots’ fight against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, Labour party defends Corbyn and emphasises that he did show respect for the pilots by attending the event.
The heroism of the Royal Air Force is something to which we all owe an enormous debt of gratitude.
He (Corbyn) stood in respectful silence during the anthem, the statement emphasised.
Corbyn’s election to party leadership has divided Labour party.
Especially among the MPs there are those, who fear that his radical views will scare the more moderate voters.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament and opposes cuts to public services and welfare.
Today is the first time Corbyn is supposed to act as a party leader in the parliament during Prime Minister's Questions.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what he should ask from Prime Minister David Cameron.
During the weekend, Cameron criticised Corbyn’s election as party leader on Twitter.
The Labour Party is now a threat to our national security, our economic security and your family's security, tweeted the Prime Minister from his own account.
The reason for Minnesota family murder is still unclear - the father of the family was facing a lawsuit
The police of South Lake Minnetonka has for almost a week now investigated the family murder that took place in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five was found dead from their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed the shooter to be the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first killing his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short shot himself in the house’s garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was beginning to worry about the children's absence.
Based on this notification, the police went to inspect the house and found the Short family dead from different corners of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead already for days.
House worth of millions and a successful company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Mike Siitari says the investigation of the case is still ongoing.
The motive behind the bloody deed is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his fortune creating a social media website for nurses, AllNurses.com.
In 2014 StarTribune interview Short told there were 4 million unique visitors on the website every week.
I have had 50 buyouts during the last ten years.
I have turned them all down.
I do, however, have many ideas I want to realise.
Maybe I will send the company at some point, but not yet.
The success could be seen in for example that in 2011 Short family bought a mansion in Greenwood for $2 million.
The real estate site Zillow advertises the property as a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for 8 cars.
Lawsuit pending
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit, though.
Achieve Test Prep, who offer different prepping courses, had sued him for some comments on AllNurses.com website.
Achieve Test Prep alleged that Short’s website failed to delete defamatory comments about prep courses, thus sending business to a competitor.
According to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the lawsuit would have had much significance on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri treating people to coffee and cake
In addition, the owner trio were awarded with a horse owner of the month price by Suomen Hippos, The Finnish trotting and breeding association.
This is awesome, commented Loiri convivially on his certificate.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September, earning 100,000 with the win.
Artist legend Loiri was still bemused about Fabrice Duo’s success in the great competition.
I still can't believe this happened.
Korpi, the trainer of the successful horse, has full privacy when working with the horse.
Pekka instructs and decides where to race the horse.
And I keep my muzzle shut, Loiri cackled.
An amazing gesture from an NHL star - “The all-time biggest donation made by an athlete”
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6,7 million euros) to Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital’s announcement, this is the all-time biggest single charity donation made by an athlete in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has pledged to help the hospital in other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban made an 8-year contract worth 72 million dollars with the Canadiens.
That means Subban's donation is significantly larger than his 9-million dollar annual earnings.
As a recognition for his donation, an atrium in the hospital will be named after Subban.
Canadiens players have already before significantly helped the local hospitals.
The long-time captain, Jean Beliveau, who passed away a year ago raised millions of dollars for, for instance, the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a hefty sum to another big hospital in the city, which was used to buy a PET scanner needed in cancer examinations.
It is possible to order a wife from a Japanese cafe - she will serve a meal wearing only bikinis and an apron
Theme cafes are a big hit in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a cuddling cafe - and now, a wife cafe.
The service is a hit for the lonely, in need of company and hungry.
Metro reported on the matter.
The Tokyo cafe Ore no Yome (‘My Wife’) offers a possibility to order a wife or a husband for the evening.
This is a waiter/waitress, who pretends to be the client’s spouse.
You choose the “spouse” from a list beforehand, and they will then cook and serve the meal.
The wife will welcome you wearing only bikinis and a kitchen apron, while the husband will be wearing nothing but tight cycling shorts.
The website offers information on the wife candidates, everything from their height and weight to what kind of a mattress they like to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the Internet: Preparations begin for mitigating cyberattacks against connected vehicles.
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) will also encourage technological progression and innovation, the announcement by Intel said.
The board will encompass top security industry talent across the globe.
The ASRB researchers will perform ongoing security tests and audits intended to codify best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel also published the first version of its automotive cybersecurity best practices white paper.
The company will continue to update the paper based on ASRB findings.
International ICT field research and advisory firm Gartner predicts that by 2020, the number of connected passenger vehicles on the road in use will be about 150 million.
Few things are more personal than our safety while on the road.
According to same prediction, 60% to 75% of these vehicles will be capable of consuming, creating and sharing Web-based data.
We can, and must, raise the bar against cyberattacks in automobiles, said Chris Young, general manager of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish security best practices and encourage the view that cybersecurity is an essential ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our safety while on the road, making the ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading computer science innovators.
Ford Focus RS price in Finland about 52,000 euros!
Ford Focus RS model has been relished for years.
Finally the car is looming on the horizon also in Finland.
Ford published information on the RS now that the eyes of the car world are on Frankfurt’s International Motor Show.
The new four-wheel drive RS by Ford accelerates from 0 to 100 in 4.7 seconds, thanks to its 2.3 litre, 350 horse power engine. The top speed is 266 kilometres per hour.
What is also of interest to Finns is the price that is provisionally told to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available for order, though Ford does not say in its announcement when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
Popular brand Kia introduced two new products at the Frankfurt International Motor Show - these are new Sportage and Optima
From a Finnish point of view, the more important of these two novelties is the fourth-generation Sportage Kia is planning to use to seize a bigger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage, created under the direction of the new European Chief Designer Gregory Guillaume, is more rounded in form than earlier.
There is an extra centimetre here and there as to the wheelbase and outside measures, and the car slices the air even more efficiently than before.
In outline, the engine selection is the same, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepowers has been added to the roster.
More information about Kia Sportage, its performance and fuel consumption will be revealed closer to its launch.
We have to wait for it a bit, for the new Sportage arrives in spring 2016.
Already before the year changes, the new Kia Optima arrives in our country.
At a first glance it does not look to have changed, but it is a completely new car.
Kia intends to win over the hearts of the upper middleclass buyers with even better road-handling characteristics, lower noise level and higher-grade equipment.
At first we will have Optimas with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre gas engines.
Next summer the pace will accelerate, as a new Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine will join them.
Around the same time with its arrival, the sales for Optima estate car will begin.
Chisu’s return to stage in a striking jumpsuit
Singer Chisu takes part in Elämä Lapselle (Life for Children) concert together with other Finnish stars.
Her electric blue jumpsuit has a flamboyant, low-cut neckline.
The outfit prettily highlights the star singer’s petite waist.
The ensemble is topped off with a golden metallic belt and red lipstick.
During her three-year break, the singer had a child and then managed to shed the pregnancy weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu’s daughter is soon one year old.
The singer released the first single from her upcoming record in August.
Returning to stage and in front of the public after a long break doesn’t really make me nervous.
I have missed all the things related to music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu releases her new, fourth album called Polaris.
A new situation in life has inspired me to write new songs.
At this stage I wonder, whether people will discover my new album, Chisu tells.
Kim Kardashian’s maternity style astonishes again - this time with a breast showing
Reality beauty Kim Kardashian is, once again, the topic of the day.
She readily showcases her baby bump and breasts in sexy clothes, most recently last night one o’clock American time, as she left her husband Kanye West's gig with her sister Kourtney Kardashian.
The black maternity dress has a sheer chest.
The flash lights reveal nude bra underneath the dress.
Last time Kardashian wore an amazon-like maternity outfit when she visited her friend in New York for a dinner party just a couple of days ago.
Black over-the-knee boots accentuated the outfit.
A third unusual maternity outfit was seen as recently as on Friday last week, when the pregnancy belly was on display.
Hard laws of modelling world: No home, you’re lonely, competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the impression that modelling world is pure glamour and champagne parties.
She made her own documentary called Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues say their piece about modelling business.
Harpeer’s Bazaar put together Leloup’s six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season is a new start.
Even if you had posed in top designers’ outfits during the previous season, the new season always starts with castings.
And each season new girls arrive, and the veterans must compete against the fresh faces.
Models rarely have a place of their own to call home.
The work is constant travelling, and it can mean even an entire year of living out of hotels and apartments, where the fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, he loneliness can be very challenging.
New York and Paris can be sought after places to work in, but they are the most stressful.
There are different standards of thin.
An agent in New York may tell you to lose a few kilos, but in Paris they then may think you look too skinny.
Getting a job is constant risky game.
During the fashion week, models and designers are together the whole time and, at the same time, serve as a support system.
When the fashion weeks are over, separation is sad.
Models choose this job for the opportunities it affords them, but it rankles them that everybody thinks the work is just presenting clothes.
Even models want to be personalities.
The job makes them feel like they are actors in a role.
Modelling is also a form of self-expression.
Models yesterday in Tory Burch show.
New York Fashion Week is under way, with designers revealing their next year's collections.
Roope Salminen had a change of style to play the role of the least known Apulanta musician in a film
Roope Salminen will play the role of the founding member of Apulanta, Antti Lautala, in the film based on the early years of the band.
Lautala started Apulanta in 1991 together with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
This is quite a challenge to me, since I’m a rap artist of nearly 26 years, and in the film I’m a 16-year-old guitarist, laughs Salminen.
I haven’t wanted to meet the real Antti before shooting, since I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the least known of that group, so I think it’s a good thing I’m learning his style of playing only from a video.
I don’t want to make an imitation of a person.
The head of Roope Salminen ja Koirat band does not have to play the role starting from a scratch.
According to Salminen, punk mannerisms come naturally to him.
In the punk episode of Tähdet, tähdet show many people surely had a foretaste, and the same applies if you have ever come to our gigs.
Our gigs have never been conventional, but we always have a full speed on.
The main actors for the film Teit meistä kauniin, directed by Apulanta bassist of 1993-2004 Tuukka Temonen, were announced today.
Young actors that are still somewhat unknown to the public play the roles of the familiar core group of the band.
Teppo Manner will be drummer Sipe Santapukki, Tatu Sinisalo is singer Toni Wirtanen, and Iiro Panula is bassist Tuukka Temonen.
Roope Salminen hinted about his future job already yesterday evening, when he on Snapchat mysteriously stated he is preparing for the most important day of his career.
Already yesterday Roope posted an image of his new look for the film to Instagram.
Earlier seen sporting a moustache and a soul patch, now Roope has smoothly shaven cheeks and he has dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how to tell children about refugees
Many parent has had to wonder about how to tell a child about the situation of the refugees coming to Europe.
Or should they tell anything about it?
You do not have to force the discussion, advises member of the Finnish Red Cross crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
You should protect smaller children and not let them for example watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and that can remain whirling in their minds, causing anxiety, he says.
If a child has seen an image of refugees in the television or heard about it elsewhere, you should discuss the matter.
You should start the discussion from the child’s point of view and listen closely what she or he asks.
Fears of a child can be surprising.
They are necessary not the same a parent thinks the child is fearing.
You should not scare the child for no reason, even though you yourself are anxious or even scared.
A smaller child closely follows parents’ behaviour.
If parents stay calm during the discussion, also the child feels safe.
Bigger children most likely hear discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.
If the child is thinking about the matter, the parents should discuss it with the child.
The fact is that not all the people in the world are well-off.
The parents can, together with the children, think how our family feels about this.
Do we think the world is eventually a safe or an unsafe place.
The parents may also have different parenting views - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as well as they can.
On the other hand: If the family discusses also the difficult issues, the child is given a model about how to deal with difficulties in life.
This can come in handy later.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your child to help the weaker ones”
No more strength left?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
Pallosalama striking Vermo is hard to control
Perttu Pohjola managed to coach Apilan Pallosalama into a fierce condition in the midsummer.
It trotted only first and second places, until it collapsed in the end of July in Tampere harness race.
Since the stallion was completely exhausted, the trainer thought there is something wrong with it and reserved a vet appointment for his charge.
The explanation for exhaustion was found after a viewing.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest possible, but required two courses of medication before it was conquered.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be restricted to light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised about the horse’s last run.
In Turku it trotted a record time and was second after the Finland’s best, mare Taruntuuli.
Apilan Pallosalama was quite energetic after the break, since it could have been trained normally only for some weeks.
Taking all of this into consideration, it is understandable that there was a drop towards the end, says Pohjola.
The trainer supposes that a proper competition did the stallion good.
The shape of the horse progressed surely, and hopefully it also balanced.
Apilan Pallosalama is a so called humorous horse.
When it hasn’t felt up to it, it might’ve stopped trying even without sickness.
Instead on a good day the stallion has had such a lightning spurt that the competitors have been amazed.
The competitors are not a match in short distance speed to Pallosalama, who can run almost in a thoroughbred kind of way.
Pohjola hopes for a slipstream run at Vermo.
But it is a whole different thing how Apilan Pallosalama feels about that.
It can be pretty tricky during the start, and might for example sneak under the boom of the start car or something like that.
I hope the stallion would be more calm than in Turku.
When Apilan Pallosalama is in condition, it can also come from the front and we will race to win, promises the trainer.
This is why you cannot get rid of useless iPhone applications
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least part of the applications that come with Apple iPhones can possibly be removed sometime in the future - but not all of them.
Apple is possibly going to remove some of their own applications from iPhones in the future, says the company CEO, Tim Cook, in an interview for Buzzfeed.
There is a bunch of applications in Apple iPhone that relatively few have use of: For example FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stocks, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these applications is Apple Watch, which was an obligatory update to iPhones, even though it is necessary only those who own Apple Watch.
According to Cook, removing Apple applications is a more complex issue than it first appears.
There are some apps that are linked to something else on the iPhone.
If they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone, Cook states to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple iPhone applications function closely with other applications.
There are other apps that aren’t like that.
So over time, I think we can figure out a way to let the user remove them, said Cook.
So according to Cook, Apple is looking into the matter, because the company does not want to waste memory space from the users’ iPhones.
Euro are inflation down to 0.1 per cent in August
Euro area consumer prices went up only slightly in August, 0.1% from a year earlier, told the statistical office of the European Union, Eurostat, today.
The inflation was slowed down by lower energy prices.
This way Eurostat revised its preliminary estimate of 0.2% from couple weeks back slightly downward.
In July the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so called core inflation was down to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat’s preliminary estimate for core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
The energy in euro area was 7.2% cheaper than a year ago.
The average inflation of the whole EU area of 28 countries was flat in August.
In July the growth was 0.1 per cent.
From all the euro countries in August, the consumer prices were up the most, 1.4%, in Malta.
The inflation rate was the lowest in Cyprus, with the prices going down 1.9 per cent.
The inflation in Finland was 0.2 per cent negative, according to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices.
The euro area inflation is still behind the goal set by the European Central Bank (ECB): price increase of around two per cent in the medium term.
ECB predicts a euro are inflation of about 0.1 per cent for this year.
Next year the increase will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts, published in the beginning of September.
The United States’ Fed will next attempt to tighten the monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin in its quickest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country’s central bank Fed will begin to raise its interests after a long period.
And as for the decline in the financial markets, it will begin before the next recession.
Fed has hinted at beginning the rate hikes possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
That means the next recession can be here as soon as by next autumn and the financial markets’ rate crash before tat.
Or at least that will happen, if the largest economy in the world and the financial markets function in the same way as before - and if they react to Fed’s financial limitations the same way as before.
These are the conclusions the London market research strategists of German Deutsche Bank Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Parker came to in their study of long-term market and economy cycles.
The bank distributed the study report of over 60-pages, Long-Term Asset Return Study, to their international major customers last week.
The strategists who created the study and the report do not try to make anyone believe that they know exactly when the Fed will begin to raise its interests or what happens after that in economy and markets.
Instead they demonstrate how the economy and the markets have previously behaved during and after Fed interest hikes, using cool facts and calculations.
In addition to historical observations they also analyse which essential variables of economy and the financial markets are now on the same or different level than during earlier interest hikes - and what are the possible implications.
It is evident that both the economy and the financial markets are now weaker to withstand a rate hike than ever before since the 1950s.
Perhaps a less than a year to a recession
The leaders deciding on Fed's monetary policy and its prevailing setting have during last summer and early autumn hinted that the time might be ripe to raise the rates.
The first rate hike in over nine years can come already this week.
The matter is settled during Wednesday and Thursday, as the Fed board's so called open market committee convenes for its two-day meeting to decide on the matter.
The previous time Fed raised its so called Fed funds key interest rate was in June 2006.
That marked the end of two years of series of relatively regular but minor 0.25 percentage point rate hikes that the Fed used to raise its interest from 1.25 to 5.25 percent.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with difficulties in the most high-risk housing financing, and a year later the financial crisis widened to a global doomsday nightmare.
The great recession arrived in 2009.
The last time serious adversities of financial markets and real economy began slower than what has been typical after earlier Fed interest hikes.
In proportion, the adversities were harder and harsher than since the 1930s depression.
The Deutsche strategists have screened the upturns and downfalls of the greatest economies in the world as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950, for some parts even from the beginning of the 19th century onwards.
They report Fed's rate hikes and their economic and financial impacts since the 1950s.
The recession has begun the quickest in less than a year after the first rate hike, most of the time in less than three years, and on average in less than three and a half years.
The increase in prices in the financial markets has ended within a year or two after Fed interest hikes have begun.
Fed has alternated between rising and reducing their key interest rate since the beginning of the 1950s in dozen cycles of different length.
Each time has, for some parts, varied from others, and there are relatively little occasions in the examination, so it is hardly possible to reach any certain conclusions about the impacts of the next rate hikes.
The strategists remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest have been too low for too long
The pivotal factors contributing to, not to mention the culprits for the financial crisis cannot necessarily be unquestionably discovered even with decades of research.
But there are three circumstances leading to the crisis and increasing its destructive power that are clear somewhat beyond doubt:
1) Fed, European Central Bank ECB and other largest central banks of the world held their key interest rates on a too low a level for too long a time in the 2000s.
They were patching the marks left by the techno bubble and at the same time stoking up the next.
2) The size of a debt of different parts of financial and real economies, accumulated over decades and already too large, grew even larger because of the overly lax monetary policy of the central banks.
The so far largest debt bubble in the economic history was created.
3) The madly cheap debt funding, packed especially to financial economy almost without restraints, inflated the largest rate bubbles in the so far economic history for most of the sectors of financial markets, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
There will probably be no severe arguments either about the fact that the financial markets that have increased to heights due to more and more complicated debt leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state the last time Fed and other central banks increased the rates.
Neither the financial structures set up with debt leverage nor evaluation bubbles did last but a certain time after the rate hikes had begun and the costs of debt funding had started to rise.
The risks were materialised as a financial crisis, and a great recession followed.
A bigger bubble and more debt
The Deutsche Bank strategists will not guess what happens next, but they give us food for thought by mentioning for instance the following facts:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now held their monetary policy setting even lighter and even longer than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for a long time before the crisis, they now have been even lower for even longer.
2) Incurring of a debt has not, for a long time, been as madly cheap as it was ten years ago, but debt money is now literally cheaper than free at its cheapest.
That way the debt load of financial and real economies has not lightened, but the different parts of economy are churning under a considerably heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter, ever before.
3) The liquidity from the central banks that has started off cheaper and more fast-flowing than before has mostly stayed at the financial markets and has dragged the key types of securities and properties to their highest peak since before the financial crisis or ever.
And the strategists are killing the mood not only with the warning signs of financial markets, but also by noting that not even the United States’ economy has recovered yet from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades like it earlier has.
The euro area has recovered barely at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but respectively the pressure and risks of the financial markets are clearly larger than before the financial crisis, as Fed will next start to cut off their money.
Maybe the outlook of Albert Edwards, a strategist from a French bank Societe Generale, is not as weird as it may seem at a first glance.
For quite some time now, he has coached the international investor customers as to the Fed’s next reversal:
First they raise the interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it is time for Fed to hasten to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money hoses.
Computer and printer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to shed up to 33,000 jobs.
The main part of the cuts will be targeted to the enterprise services business, says the company.
In November, HP is splitting into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, focussing on the enterprise business, and HP Inc., focussing on computers and printers for consumers.
HP had the most personnel in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In November last year the number had been reduced to 302,000.
The company will enter a charge of 2.7 billion dollars (about 2.4 billion euros) for the restructuring.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000-30,000 jobs.
The consumer side cuts will be 3,300 during three years.
HP intends to relocate its operations to lower-cost countries so that 60 percent of its employees will work in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business operations in a way that none of its clients is responsible for over ten percent of the company’s business result.
As recently as the year before last, its three most significant clients created 65 percent of the business result.
iOS 9: how to get new iPhone operating system, as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app, tapping "General," and then selecting "Software Update."
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have run into problems after that installation, being hit by an error message telling them that "Software update failed."
To get around that, users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down, or to try and upgrade through iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That might include deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update, and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re-install them once the process is over.
It's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens, so that it doesn't run out of battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking.

Yle: Minister Berner on board of tax haven firm
According to Yle, the Minister of Transport and Communications (Centre), Anne Berner, has served on the board of a tax haven firm.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so called tax planning.
The company in question is Saltri II LuxCo from Luxembourg, and Berner joined the board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg register of companies she still remains on the board.
Berner herself says she has already given notice of her resignation in May this year.
" looked into the matter and it’s enough that I have handed in my resignation.
It’s almost impossible to manage and control that everything is in the right register in time, Berner says in Yle’s interview.
Member after a merger
The company in Luxembourg is used to manage the holdings of a Swedish Kährs company.
Kährs is a flooring company who merged with the Finnish flooring company Karelia-Upofloor already in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor between 2010 and 2013, and after the merger she served on board of Kährs as well as the company from Luxembourg.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings go through a complicated ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner said to Yle that she accepted the board position in the Luxembourgian company by request of the Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have served on board of Karelia-Upofloor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner in cooperation, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt my duty was to protect shareholders in the Finnish family firm.
It is important that we ensure our Finnish companies’ capital gains are taxed in Finland, and that premise was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner said to Yle that there is no tax planning involved in Hartwall Capital ownerships.
According to Berner, the complicated ownership structure in a tax haven only exists because Kährs’ biggest owner, investment company Triton, already had a holding company in Luxembourg for ownership.
First company-run reception centre opens in Espoo
The first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi district of Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to welcome the first hundred occupants already today from 6 PM onwards.
The space may increase within a week to accommodate a maximum of 300 to 400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service sets up the reception centre on the facilities of a former emergency services college.
A company specialising in healthcare and medical services production, Luona Oy, will run the operations.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together for instance on the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK is preparing an optional competitiveness package
STTK will begin to prepare an optional package for the Government’s tightening of working life conditions.
The organisation hopes that also other labour market organisations will contribute.
According to the chairman, Antti Palola, at this moment their attention is on this Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative methods of lowering the cost of work will be discussed again after that.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, said Palola to reporters while on a break from a meeting organised by the organisations management.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) has no readiness for discussions.
The economists of STTK have calculated that the change security included in the Government’s competitiveness package will cost about 30 million euros to employers, when the other side of the package is 2.700 million.
I do not know, if a party is that excited in taking part in discussions, if they are on the receiving end with a ratio of one to hundred.
Palola: Constructive dialogue
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has hoped to receive alternative proposals by Wednesday, because the Government is then due to give a statement about their own package to the Parliament, and to begin the preparation for the reform.
Palola did not take a stand on whether the schedule is realistic or not.
According to Palola, there exists a dialogue with the Government, and he thinks it has been constructive the whole time.
According to Palola, especially Sunday pay cut is a sore issue for the Finnish Confederation of Professionals (STTK).
The organisation requires that the Government retreats from mandatory legislation it plans to use in implementing part of the package.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm to the idea of preparing an alternative package together with SDP who have raised the issue.
The salary earners will meet in Helsinki on Friday to protest against the competitiveness package introduced last week by the Government.
As part of the package, the pay for the first sick leave days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75 per cent and the holidays will be shortened.
STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited salary earners to a demonstration, and the goal has not been to arrange a strike.
Commendations from Akava’s Fjäder
Akava President Sture Fjäder acknowledges STTK’s announcement about preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK now aligns with Akava, for Akava has already for some time drafted an alternative model for the Government’s proposals.
Fjäder hopes that also SAK takes part in the alternative package, because without SAK, the package is not inclusive enough.
Akava President Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, head by Lauri Lyly, will join in in preparing a proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palola’s STTK said earlier on Wednesday that new proposals are being drafted.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava reported on Wednesday that it has for already a long time been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the country’s government’s aim of five percent competitiveness leap as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been willing to negotiate the whole time, and we have already for a long time been writing an alternative model for the government’s proposals.
We are ready to consider conditions of employment as part of the deal.
In return we want change security and working time banks, say the President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that also SAK would think on similar terms with Akava, like STTK already did on Wednesday.
Without SAK the package is not strong enough.
Together we will now prepare a model that is acceptable to the government and to employers, says Fjäder.
Akava’s working committee will meet on Thursday at 15 o’clock to decide on the possible contents of the agreement.
“Same boat, common goal, voluntary work” - play bingo while Sipilä speaks tonight
The Green Left in the University of Tampere
The Green Left in the University of Tampere, Viva, has a bingo coupon for tonight.
Earlier the Prime Ministers have given special speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and the wars.
The Prime Minister Juha Sipilä extremely exceptionally will address the nation about the state of Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening 9.05 PM.
When looking for a similar Prime Minister’s speech, we have to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, while being the Prime Minister, gave a famous broadcasted speech that meant the beginning of the end for Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and the ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave the New Year’s speech instead of the President Mauno Koivisto, but that was more related to ceremony.
In the autumn 1976, president Urho Kekkonen brought an end to the train dispatcher strike with a televised speech.
Soliloquy, monarchist pursuit
During the whole day, Sipilä’s speech has invited criticism and guesses about what is to come.
The Left Alliance leader Paavo Arhinmäki said via Twitter that “Sipilä could make his speech about the situation of the nation also in the parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would allow for discussion.”
According to Ville Niinistö from Green League, “we have already seen soliloquy”.
Dialogue and listening to people are part of being a leader.
Erkki Tuomioja of the Social Democratic Party judged in Facebook that “this is a monarchist pursuit: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them”.
The leader of the Social Democratic Party Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: “It has been almost six months since the election.
The Prime Minister has not once appeared in the media with the opposition.
We have tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the speech has been recorded beforehand, and it lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions, SAK, it will be commented live by the SAK President Lauri Lyly and the Director General of the Confederation of Finnish Industries Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticised for broadcasting Sipilä’s speech.
We considered the matter and found that it is part of the task for a public service to promote the publicity countrywide publicity, declared Yle Director of Media Ismo Silvo for Yle news.
Like in the 60s
The speech has also provoked taunts.
“When the evening comes, dinner is eaten early, and the children are washed and dressed in their Sunday best.
Mother changes into a prettier frock and father puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o’clock the family then quietens down in front of the television, as if a TV series family of yore”, writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“In his speech, will the Prime Minister Sipilä also tell why there are millionaires hiding their funds in tax paradises sitting in the Finnish government, creating acts of indemnity to their tax evader pals and, at the same time, arguing to people that we must cut becuase the country has no money left?”, asks Pia Lohikoski.
One guess about what Sipilä will say is presented by Viva, the Green Left in the University of Tampere.
It has published the herewith bingo in Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat, common goal, living on credit and team spirit tonight?
Ready your coupons and pens, it begins at 9.05 PM from the channels TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari for the Guardian: The West ignored Russian offer to have al-Assad step aside
More than three years ago the West ignored Russian offer to have Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari for the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador for the UN laid out a plan, which included having al-Assad elegantly cede power after some time.
The western countries did not grasp the proposal, though, since they thought al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari held talks about the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN security council in 2012.
He said that in a private conversation, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, laid out a three-point plan: we should not give arms to the opposition, we should get dialogue going between the opposition and al-Assad straight away, and we should find an elegant way for al-Assad to step aside.
I know Churkin.
We do not necessarily agree on all issues but we can talk candidly.
I explained what I was doing there and he said: “Martti, sit down and I’ll tell you what we should do”, Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.
No comments from the diplomats
Ahtisaari says he passed Churkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the contents of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari there is no question about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claim, but pointed out that during that time, al-Assad’s forces had already carried out multiple massacres, and the main opposition groups refused to accept any proposal that left him in power.
Britain’s former director of the Middle East department of the Foreign Office, Sir John Jenkins, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s claims, since in his experience, Russia was at no stage prepared to discuss al-Assad’s fate.
Officially Russia has supported al-Assad during the whole war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Churkin would have been speaking with Moscow’s authority.
I think if he had told me what Churkin had said, I would have replied I wanted to hear it from President Vladimir Putin too before I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have even then suspected that it was a Putin trick to keep an al-Assad supporter in power.
The flow of refugees is our own doing
At the time of Ahtisaari's talks, the death toll from the Syrian conflict was about 7.500.
The UN believes that toll passed 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
Over 11 million people have been forced out of their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster from happening.
This flow of refugees to Europe is our own doing.
I do not see any other option but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bills we have caused ourselves, states Ahtisaari to the newspaper.
Asylum seeker registration centre possibly to Tornio
Government-planned asylum seeker registration centre to Northern Finland will most likely be established to Tornio.
The centre is planned to be set up in an empty Tornio yhteislyseo school building in the town centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been searching for a suitable place, in order to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat reported that the council would have already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to the vice-chair of Tornio town council, Sauli Hyöppinen (Left) this is not true.
Since the whole council was not present and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to call for a council meeting for next Monday to decide on the matter, he clarified to STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates present in the discussion gathering.
The registration centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on this, the decision can be expected to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to the Mayor, Timo Nousiainen, the town received a contact about the matter on Monday, and they were quick to react.
It is estimated that the school building would house 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that the building could be suitable for this kind of use.
The location is about 200 metres from the border, so it would be functional also in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still hopes the labour market to present an option for tightening conditions
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre), the halving of holiday pay that has been in the public eye would only take care of one part of the Government’s attempt to lower the price of work.
He says that the Government is happy to receive an alternative package though, if the labour market organisations manage to agree on one.
Sipilä told the journalists in the parliament that he has not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
Neither did he know how serious the organisations are in their search for replacement tools for tightening working life conditions the government announced.
If this agreement is created, we are most definitely happy to receive it as part of the whole package.
According to Sipilä halving the holiday pay would be an effective tool, since it would target nearly all the salary earners, instead of for example the Sunday pay cut the government is planning.
The labour market organisations could agree on the holiday pay cuts among themselves, since they are written into the collective labour agreements instead of a law.
For now it seems that the Government will give a statement to Parliament about the tightening working life conditions on Wednesday.
According to Sipilä, the organisations’ proposals should be available before this.
But even this is not the final deadline.
Legislation process starts then, and when the train is moving, it gets harder all the time.
Now there is still time.
These things do not take long if there is a will, worded Sipilä.
The list published last week by the Government includes for example changing Epiphany and Ascension Day into unpaid days off without shortening annual working hours.
Additionally, the pay for the first sick leave days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75 per cent and the holidays will be shortened.
The reforms will be carried out through mandatory legislation, past the labour organisations, which has attracted strong criticism.
The labour market organisations organise a big demonstration on Friday to protest these actions, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approved sap hall warehouse expansion
Tohmajärvi council unanimously, but slightly grudgingly, approved the Nordic Koivu Ltd. hall, also known as the sap hall, warehouse expansion.
The fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally planned caused criticism.
The busy schedule also irritated.
The council slightly wondered how this need for space was not known a year ago, when the previous expansion was approved.
At this stage, the warehouse expansion of 400-450 square metres was accepted as part of the investment programme, but the financial side will be approved later in the interim report.
The agenda still mentioned an investment of 150,000 to 200,000 euros, but in the meeting the technical manager Erkki Ikonen stated that the cost will be about 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the ground that it brings work and tax revenue to the area.
The municipality has no risk, because the company will pay for the investment as rent, reasoned Vesa Väistö (Finns party).
A place also for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city board toned down its previous intransigent position on bringing street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right, when considering continuing the Karelian tradition in the whole region.
Joensuu is not proclaiming itself to be the capital of Karelian language, since the claim does not have historical grounds, and Karelian language is not a natural part of the area’s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu area is more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision there will be no street signs in Karelian language to be found from the city centre.
The city of Joensuu is, however, on a case-by-case basis and with careful though also ready to use Karelian language in for instance information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude for all the other operators, as well.
Even though officially Joensuu is a monolingual town, we should be open in our approach also to Karelian language users now that multiculturalism is alive and strongly transforming also in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still one of the characteristics of the region, as is the idea of Joensuu being the forest capital of whole Finland.
These both can well be utilised in various marketing in the region.
Reducing trains cut the vitality of the region
The train cuts strike straight to the vitality of the region.
The train connections have a direct effect on the industrial life and competitiveness of the region.
And this again has an effect on whether it is even possible to live and work here, wonders the mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen.
He also highlights the air travel, the continuation of which has several times been at issue.
It is vital for the whole region that our chances to survive are not diminished by the actions of the authorities, as it is now happening.
The effect of reducing these connections on for example the employment situation should be discussed, emphasises Karjalainen.
The deterioration of connections causes extra challenges to the University of Eastern Finland as to its attractiveness.
Naturally, the better the services like traffic connections and access to housing, the easier it is to find students and staff, states the rector of the University of Eastern Finland, Jukka Mönkkönen.
He notes that the poor accessibility also has an impact to the researchers, who have a high mobility and travel a lot because of their research.
The head of student recruitment, Marko Junkkarinen, says that already now it is difficult to market the university in the Western Finland, since the transverse connections are poor.
About half of the students in the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
From these students, about 10-20 per cent come from Uusimaa, whichc is partly explained with the direct train connection.
One discordant note for ‘Siun sote’ reform package on healthcare and social welfare
Joensuu city executive board ostensibly agree on provincial ‘Siun sote’ project, but one discordant note could be heard.
A member of the board, Pentti Keskisalo (Social Democrats, in the picture) mooted to abandon the whole project at a board meeting on Monday, but his motion was dismissed as it was not supported.
The board agreed on a draft decision by mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in the beginning of October before the meeting of the executive board that will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all the other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola discontinued next year
There will be passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola also in the future, albeit one train pair less frequently.
Next March will see changes in passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola.
One train pair is discontinued, but the trains still run five times a day from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cutbacks are due to the state’s austerity measures.
The Ministry of Traffic and Communications’ train traffic purchase money for the next four years is cut back 12.3 million euros.
Some of the quieter routes are eliminated altogether.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will come into effect on March 27, 2016.
Boys climbed to a roof, one could not come down, the friends ran off
The rescue department helped the 12-year-old who climbed to the roof and then could not get down off the hook.
The situation arose at Ketotie street in the district of Tornionmäki around 5.30 PM on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-story wooden house without ladders leading to the roof.
That did not stop the group of boys, who decided to climb to the roof by using the old radio amateur mast beside the house.
Other boys managed to use the route also for descent, but one could not.
The result was that the others ran off and the passers-by called the rescue department to help the last boy from the roof safely to the ground with the help of their extension ladder.
FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent, which will take effect Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same that it hired last year.
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates, while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs.
In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision, to be announced Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.
Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.
If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets' hands so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.
For Fed policymakers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate.
"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.
But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop, offering an dizzying array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil.
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles.
If all that shopping makes you hungry, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food stall (good, inexpensive) is near the registers, and has various takeout options.
What it stocks: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Items are reasonably priced, and a number of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like.
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork casings, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially-prepared foods and more.
Who shops there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
The find: Fresh monthong durian next to the checkout stand.
Where is it: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles hugging the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can get busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Brazil's Pediatric Society of Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Breastfeeding Diets
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding, by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system.
Due to excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's dash to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today.
Nine's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international telecasts which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today's 339,000.
Today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but its figure was behind last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children, averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes."
Seven's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire's show.

The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
And the three girls left standing certainly aren't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really down to earth, she's so much fun to be around," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
For her part, Mackay said last week's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be "the one."
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.
And asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7.30pm on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's wealthiest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, seized and his pro democracy efforts curtailed.
4 Killed After Police Fire Rubber Bullets at Protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.
10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday.
NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google launches donation-matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a donation-matching campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations aiding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog.
Rather than having an executive make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely driven by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.
"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.
At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is where this paper is critical, because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.
I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes, reversing that is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees" home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US" violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.
Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.
Rumour Mill: No Celtic disharmony
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony at Celtic as Deila admits Hoops are in a bad place but he'll turn it around.
Hearts to fight SFA over Neilson charge and Warburton wary of January signings disrupting squad unity
Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"
It is because Rangers aren't there.
People here don't only talk about Rangers coming back.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games.
I'll turn things around, vows Deila
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better.
To stay together now is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season.
The squad is doing really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu in retirement hint
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years, and failed to find a move away from Wales in the summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was dismissed and went on to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - the third Collum red card in eight months to be rescinded.
Neilson is sticking with what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on a performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The diehard Hibee was carpeted after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."
Tannadice board has faith in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's board still has faith in the management team to turn things round - but concedes the on-field decline must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We'll get the boys ready to go again," said Donnelly.
McInnes glad to "win ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Accies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There's not a team out there who has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, who haven't won games like that."
Scots unemployment remains unchanged as UK total rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 during the period May to July while the number out of work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK's rate of 5.5 per cent, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three month period, with the number of those in work now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 74.0 per cent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish Labour market with employment increasing and unemployment falling.
Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.
Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the Canning River.
A Perth man's bid to lose a police tail came undone after he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to "coax him gently back to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins ditched his car to avoid a booze bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but did inspire locals to begin planning a tongue-in-cheek Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a cheat.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
That really saddens me.
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.
It could have had it last night.
It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.
It had it on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.
It is a joke.
People making these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram hit-and-run driver arrested
Police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove away without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday a 50-year-old Nathalia man handed himself in to police at Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram man, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?
To me it's agendas.
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200k bail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
He has clear connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.
"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.
Police attended and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.
She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium.
He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.
Last month, they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe's address.
"The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it's titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate.
The chief whip said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts at it enterprise services business.
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7bn, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $50bn in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions" to companies, according to a company statement.
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
It is nothing major.
This was just an accident.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you are coming back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get over that.
I hope his body stabilises, I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves.
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never been done at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring, particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever, with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.
In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.
Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.
But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.
In this age of social-media led communication, with its focus on style over substance, immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health.
And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football on the comfy chairs, and Ross's pining for Rachel, came from the knowledge that yes, men can all relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.
The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.
And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.
It augurs well.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a magnificent match from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodities prices, on Wednesday raised $2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan.
London-listed Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay down debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week revealed the $2.5-billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $30 billion debt pile by about a third.
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
It offloaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half, as coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on Sept. 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening, after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington, before going on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly on Sept.
Obama and Xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.
"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.
Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, letting out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as The Martian actor's comments settled in the air.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.
The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing, "Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.
Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," leaders said.
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten went first completing the challenge on time, making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's grueling stage 4, however, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean it's amazing to think about, like I've never made or lived off more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of his serious pay-bump.
So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.
I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He's received tons of accolades from fans.
He's such a great guy, and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.
Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise, and improve opening-up policies," he said, addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border-control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits, or "green card," by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
