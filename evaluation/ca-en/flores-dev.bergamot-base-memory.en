In Berlin, police estimated some 6,500 protesters.
There were also protests in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, La Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
Nearly 200 people protested outside the offices of some major copyright owners in London.
Last month there were major protests in Poland when the country signed the ACTA, which has pushed the Polish government to make the decision not to ratify the agreement, for the time being.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining the ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RPSCA) call for the mandatory installation of closed-circuit television cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
New South Wales RSPCA chief inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that surveillance and slaughterhouse inspection should be a common practice in Australia.
The CCTV would surely send the powerful message to people who work with animals, that their well-being is of top priority.
The U.S. Geological Survey map with international earthquake activity showed no seismic activity in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic Weather Office also reported a lack of seismic activity in the Hekla area for the past 48 hours.
The significant seismic activity resulting from the phase change occurred on March 10 on the north-eastern face of the volcano's caldera.
The existence of dark clouds has been reported at the base of the mountain unrelated to any volcanic activity.
Clouds could potentially cause confusion about the fact that there had been a real eruption.
The Luno contained 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when it broke and was pushed into the vulture between strong winds and waves.
Some helicopters rescued the twelve crew members and the only injury has been a broken nose.
The 100-meter ship was en route to collect its usual fertilizer cargo and authorities were initially concerned that the ship could spill a cargo.
The proposed amendment was already approved by both chambers in 2011.
In this legislative session there was a change when the second sentence was removed first by the House of Representatives and then approved similarly by the Senate on Monday.
The rejection of the second statement, which proposes to ban same-sex civil unions, could open the door to civil unions in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be reviewed again by the new elected legislature in 2015 or 2016.
Vautier's successes outside the leadership include a 1973 hunger strike against what he saw as political censorship.
The French law was changed. His activism began at the age of 15 when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
In 1998 he documented himself in a book.
He returned to the newly independent Algeria to teach film directing in the 1960s.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was advertised as intrahepatic cancer of the bile duct.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to having been Olympic and world champion, Saito was the chairman of the training committee of the National Judo Federation of Japan at the time of his death.
At least 100 people had attended the party to celebrate the first birthday of a couple who had married last year.
According to authorities, a formal anniversary act was scheduled for a later date.
The couple had married in Texas a year earlier and they arrived in Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, born in Buffalo, has been one of the four killed in the shooting, but his wife has not been injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English tutor, who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory schools and claimed to have 9,000 pupils at the peak of his career.
In his annotations he used words that some relatives considered rude, and supposedly blasphemed in the classroom.
Modern Education has accused him of printing large ads about buses without authorization and of lying in saying he was the most important English teacher.
He was also previously blamed for copyright infringement, but was not charged.
A former student said he "had used slang in class, taught skills for dating with notes, and was like a friend of students."
For the past three decades, although a communist state has officially remained, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic level has increased 90 times.
For the first time, China last year exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for its industry.
Within two decades China's GDP could exceed that of the United States.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named hurricane season in the 2010 Atlantic, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will rise in intensity to hurricane category next Wednesday.
Because the storm is far from making landfall, it is still difficult to assess the potential impact in the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Bobek became famous while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
He scored 403 goals in 468 games during the time he was part of the team.
No one has ever played games again or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted the best player in the history of Partizan.
The celebrations began with a special program for the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
Then they performed the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a band of Janissaries, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
The Whirling Dervishes took to the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
As the end of the show, Turkish dance company Fire of Anatolia showed the public its "Troy" performance.
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in an accident at the Indianapolis Circuit.
While doing the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle, and was then run over by fellow racer Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately attended to by the circuit's medical team and moved to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was unharmed from the crash.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero went on to say that "the financial system is a part of the economy, a crucial part.
We have a one-year crisis, which has had the sharpest moment in the last two months, and I think now the financial marks are beginning to recover."
Last week, Naked News announced a considerable increase in its engagement with international language news, with three new programs.
The world organization is already reporting in English and Japanese, and is launching programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the web and mobile devices.
Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene with people trying to break the windows to be able to leave.
People were trying to break the glass with the chairs, but the windows were indestructible.
At the end one of the crystals broke, and they began to come out the window, survivor Franciszek Kowal said.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy generated when hydrogen atoms bind (or melt) to form heavier elements.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years before we see functional fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on the water due to the surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules on the surface are strongly attracted to each other more than they do with the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water that allows things like the needle to float on the water.
The blade of a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hole in the middle. The two edges allow for better grip on the ice, even when inclined.
Because the base of the blade is slightly curved, so the blade tilts to one side or another, the edge that is in contact with the ice also curves.
This causes the skater to turn around. If the skates lean to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates lean to the left, the skater turns left.
In order to return to the previous energy level, they must be released from the extra energy they have obtained from the light.
This is carried out by emitting a small particle of light that we call "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because they stimulate atoms with white light, causing the emission of a light photon, and light is a type of radiation. 
The following image shows atoms emitting photons. Of course, the photons are actually much smaller than those shown by the figure.
Photons are even smaller than what makes up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb filament ends up burning and the light bulb stops working.
Then the light bulb needs to be changed. You have to be careful to change the bulb.
To start, you need to close the switch of the light device or disconnect the wire.
The reason is that the electricity circulating through the plug where the metal part of the bulb is can be seriously electrocuted if you touch the inside of the switch or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially inside the plug.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which is responsible for pumping blood.
Blood leaves the heart through ducts called arteries and returns in behaviors called veins. Smaller ducts are called capillaries.
The teeth of a triceratops could chew not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cycs, a common type of plant in Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, thorny leaves.
A triceratops may have used its strong beak to remove the leaves to stretch before eating the strain.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very poisonous, so it is not very likely that a dinosaur would eat them, although today the sloth and other animals such as the parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat leaves or poisonous fruits.
How would I stretch the gravity of Io? If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than if you were on Earth.
A person weighing 200 lbs (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 lbs (16 kg) on Io, so that, obviously, gravity pushes you with less force.
The Sun does not have a crust like the earth on which you can be. The entire Sun is composed of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes more diluted as you move away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610 the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to discover that Venus has phases, just like the moon.
The phases are explained because only the face of Venus (or the Moon) that looks at the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus in which the planets move around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England lived a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.
However, in 991 Ethelred had to face the largest Viking fleet seen since Guthrum, a century earlier.
This fleet was directed by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who was ambitious to regain his country from Danish rule.
After the initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to accept the terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to win his kingdom with relative success.
Hangul is the only alphabet created arbitrarily that has widespread use in daily life. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (14181450).
King Sejong was the fourth monarch of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the best regarded.
He initially called the Hangeul alphabet as Hunmin Jeongeum, meaning "the correct sounds for popular instruction."
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit. One of them speaks of an Arian migration from West to India that brought the language there.
Sanskrit is an ancient language comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The oldest book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the Upanishad, the Sanskrit simply dissipated because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin did for European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the Battle of France, Germany began to prepare to invade the island of Brittany.
Germany gave the attack the code name "Operation Sea Lion". Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost to the evacuation of Dunkirk, so the army was rather weak. 
However, the Royal Navy remained much more powerful than the German one ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasive fleet attempting to cross the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy warships were based near the likely invasion routes, while the admirals feared they were sunk by a German airstrike.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was basically the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a land army and weaker naval forces, although they had built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy's main objectives were African countries. To capture these countries, they would need a troop launch pad so that troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
To do this, they were to be freed from British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, the naval battles of Italy had no other objective.
As for Japan. This was an island country, like Britain.
The submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long period of time.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
At the beginning of the war, they moved mainly along the surface of the sea, but as soon as the radar began to develop, and to become more reliable, the submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.
The German submarines were called "U-Boats." The Germans were very good at sailing and operating their submarines. 
After their success with the submarines, after the war, the Germans are not trusted to have many submarines.
Yes! The Tutankhamun King, sometimes called "King Tut" or "The Child King", is one of the best-known Egyptian kings in modern times.
It is interesting to note that it was not considered very important during antiquity and was not recorded in most ancient royal charts.
However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs from the past have been looted, this tomb remained practically intact.
Most objects buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of radiated wheels made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster and better prepared to escape soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows of their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the horsemen of the Assyrian cavalry fought on the naked back of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Homer is probably the best known person in this culture. He is a legendary blind poet, who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still famous playwrights and his works are among the best productions in the world of literature.
The mathematician Pythagorea is another famous Greek. He is remembered primarily for his famous theorem on the relations of the sides of right triangles.
There are several estimates on the number of Hindi speakers. It is estimated that it is between the second and fourth most spoken languages in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether or not similar dialects are counted.
Estimates range from 340 to 500 million speakers, and there are up to 800 million people who can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary, but distinct in writing; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can often be understood with each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under a major cultural influence from Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so the Estonian written language was invented.
It was based on the German alphabet and the "Õ/õ" character was added.
Over time, many words borrowed from German merged. This was the beginning of the illustration.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go directly to the army after finishing school.
However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, obtaining a 2:2 (a lower grade of second class).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a university degree.
European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) makes up 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
The area of Turkey, including the lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 mi2), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 mi2) are in Southwestern Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 mi2), in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the 37th largest country in the world, and is the same size approximately as metropolitan France and the UK combined.
Turkey is surrounded by three-part seas: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a lot of history, but it did not become independent until 1839.
Parts that are now from Belgium in the past were part of Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization known today as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery at the top of the Paro Quarter (in Phondey Village).
In 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
Due to a fire in 1951, today only a few of the Drukgyal Dzong relics are preserved, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
The fortress was preserved and protected after the fire, and remains one of the most impressive attractions in Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was found crushed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia quite a few times during the 18th century and in 1722 they destroyed Phnom Penh.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those with a job work in the underground economy.
Two-thirds of the working Venezuelans do so in the service sector, almost a fourth work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans, the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of the population works there.
At the beginning of the nation's independence, experts from the Singapore Botanical Garden collaborated in the transformation of the island into a Tropical Garden City.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen, a hybrid of orchid, as the country's national flower.
Every October about 1.5 million herbivores travel to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills by the rains.
And after going back north from the west, crossing the Mara River again, looking for the rains that arrive during April.
In the Serengeti region is the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Zone and the Maswa Hunting Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
To learn how to create interactive media, conventional and traditional skills are needed, as well as tools that are mastered in interactive classes (creation of illustrated scripts, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate your assumptions about audiovisual production and learn to think non-linearly.
Interactive design requires components of a project to connect with each other, but it also makes sense as a separate entity.
The drawback of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of elements of the target needed to reach a range of focal lengths is much higher than for fixed lenses.
This is becoming less important because lens manufacturers are reaching higher standards in the production of lenses.
Thanks to this, zoom lenses can produce images of a quality comparable to that obtained by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of magnifying lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes it difficult to use economic zoom lenses in low light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when converting a movie to the DVD format is overscan.
Most televisions are made in such a way that they please the general public.
For this reason, everything you see on TV has been cut out the edges, above, below and on the edges.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called "overscan".
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the most possible thing is that the sidewalks are cut, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has stimulated the imagination for a long time, evoking images of fairs, banquets and Arthurian gallantry.
Even standing among millennial debris is easy to get to mind the noises and smells of the battles of another era, that you almost hear the shock of the helmets with the tiles and that you perceive the fear going up the windows of the dungeons.
Is our imagination based on reality? Why did someone build castles initially? How was the design and construction process?
Typical of the time, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more like a fortified house than a real castle.
His large glass windows and thin walls would not have managed to withstand an attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build it, the country was in a situation of relative peace and only the defense against small sides of wandering looters was needed.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations should try to prevent a single nation from becoming too powerful, and for this it was common for the governments of different countries to change their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession marked the first war whose main conflict was the balance of power.
This was a great change, since the European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious wars. The Thirty Years' War would therefore be considered the last religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC in a fire caused by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at all costs. The Ephesians, outraged, announced that the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo took note of the name later, and this is how we know it today. The temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure that you have your right hand as relaxed as possible, while still touching all the notes correctly; In addition, you should try not to make many superfluous movements with your fingers.
In this way, you will get tired as little as possible. Remember that you do not have to press the keys with more force to achieve more volume, as with the piano.
To have more volume in the accordion, the bellows are used with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for communion, identity or awareness of a human reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, an intuition or perception of the divine reality/the deity or deities.
Followers pursue a certain way of life, or practices that are designed to promote these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a single state of consciousness, in particular those of a peaceful, insightful, joyful or even ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a different religion from Hinduism although they recognize Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion gourmet meaning "way of the guru" in Punjabi. The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has taken on a capital importance and forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
Guru Nanak (1469 1539) founded religion in the 15th century. There followed another nine gurus.
However, in June 1956 Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when Poland's riots, where workers complained about lack of food and wage cuts, became a general protest against communism.
Although Krushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he relented to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladislaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent including most of present-day Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization appeared in the Indus River basin from which the name derives.
Some scholars argue that, since civilization also existed in the basins of the Sarasvati River, today dry, a more appropriate name would be the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, while others call it the Harappa civilization, referring to the first site excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of medical advances.
The doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman physicians for after the battles.
Surgeons knew several sedatives, including morphine from opium seed extracts and scopolamine from teeth-weeded seeds.
They became skilled in amputation to save gangrene patients and in turnstiles and hemostasia to cut blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman Empire brought great advances in the field of medicine and was much of the knowledge we know today.
Pureland origami is a kind of origami with the restriction that you can only make one fold at a time, no more complex folds such as inverted folds are allowed, and all folds have a simple location.
It was developed by John Smith during the 1970s to help inexperienced practitioners or those who had limited motor skills.
Children develop the awareness of race and racial stereotypes from a young age, and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority who wear the stereotype of not going well in school tend not to go well in school once they have learned the stereotype to which their race is associated.
MySpace is the third best known website in use in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the educational environment.
These websites have positive aspects, such as the ability to easily set up a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can be accessed by providing only a web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to write for students who may have problems using the keyboard or spelling.
It can be customized to make it easy to read and also with as much or as little color as you want.
Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome that has classically been defined as a symptom that includes impulsivity, tendency to distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy."
It is not a learning difficulty, but a learning disorder; "it affects between three and five percent of all children, perhaps up to 2 million children in the United States."
Children with attention deficit disorder have difficulty focusing on things such as schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like such as playing video games or watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into many problems, because they "get involved in risky behaviors, fights and challenge authority" to stimulate their brain, since their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
ADHD affects relationships with other peers because other children can't understand why they act as they do or why they spell as they do or that the level of maturity is different.
As the ability to achieve knowledge and learn has changed, as mentioned above, the base speed with which knowledge is obtained has also changed.
The way to get information was different. The focus was no longer on individual memory, but rather on the ability to remember a text.
In essence, the Renaissance was a significant change in the way of approaching learning and spreading knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands either to move, to hold weight or to swing between trees.
The hands and feet of chimpanzees are similar in size and length, showing the use of the hand to carry weight in the locomotion on the knuckles.
The human hand is shorter than the feet, with farther-right phalanges.
Fossilized hand bones from two to three million years ago show this leap in specialization from the hand of locomotion to manipulation.
There are people who believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams can often be very exhausting.
The main explanation for this phenomenon is that as a result of lucid dreams, the time between the REM states is extended.
With less DIE per night, this state in which you currently experience sound and your body recovers becomes uncommon enough to pose a problem.
This is as exhausting as if you were taking away every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to make lucid dreams every night.
Things didn't go very well for Italians in North Africa almost from the beginning. Only a week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, the eleventh division of British hussars captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief-engineer of the Italian tenth army, General Lastucci.
Marshal Italo Balbo, the governor-general of Libya and Mussolini's natural successor, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk on June 28.
Modern fencing sport is practiced on many levels, from students who learn it at university to professionals and Olympic competitors.
This sport is played mainly in a duel format, one fencer is beaten in duel with another.
Golf is a game in which players use sticks to hit balls and try to get them into a hole.
In a usual round, eighteen holes are played; players usually start with the first hole of the route and finish by the eighteenth.
The player who needs fewer blows, or swings of the club, to complete the circuit wins.
This game is played on grass and the grass around the hole is squeezed shorter and called green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is that which most people relate to the fact of traveling: recreational tourism.
That's when people go to a very different place from their day to day to relax and have fun.
Usually, the places most frequented by recreational tourists are beaches, theme parks and campsites.
When the objective of the visit to a specific place is to know its history and culture we are talking about cultural tourism.
It may be that tourists visit different emblematic places of a particular country or simply decide to concentrate in a single area.
The settlers, seeing this activity, also asked for reinforcements.
The troops that strengthened the vanguard positions included the 200-man 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments, under the control of Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later becoming generals).
Stark's men took positions along the fence at the northern end of the settler location.
They quickly extended the fence to the north with a not-too-high stone wall that ended up by the water on a small beach, just after the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River, in the northeast of the peninsula.
Gridley or Stark planted a stake about 30 meters (100 feet) in front of the fence and ordered that no one shoot until the British Army had overwhelmed it.
The American plan was to launch coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a split attack on the British garrison in Bordentown, in order to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take 700 militias across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force, of 2,400 men, was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, with the aim of launching an attack before dawn.
With the change of the race from a quarter to half a mile, the speed becomes much more relevant and the resistance becomes an absolute need.
A first-class half-mile runner, a man who can beat two minutes, evidently must possess considerable speed, but must cultivate resistance to any kind of danger.
Some cross-country races during the winter, combined with gym work for the upper body, is the best preparation for the racing season.
Proper nutritional practices by themselves cannot generate elite performance, but they can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, having effective hydration habits and understanding the different aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve performance and enjoy sport more.
The middle-ground race is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there is a lot of confusion regarding the few pieces of equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased when necessary, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel like they prefer a product even if it does not offer real benefits.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex entity that consists, according to a simplified Bohr model, in a central nucleus orbited by electrons, similar in some way to the planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative electric charge.
Before checking the condition of the victim, you must inspect the scene in order to ensure your own safety.
You must observe the position of the victim as well as approach it and any automatic warning signs.
If you get hurt trying to help, the only thing you will get will be to make the situation worse.
The study found that fear and catastrophication were mediators for the relationship between pain and disability of those who suffer from back pain.
Only the effects of catastrophism, rather than depression or fear, were conditioned to regular weekly physical activity sessions.
Those who practiced regular activity required more assistance in terms of negative perception of pain, distinguishing the differences between chronic pain and the discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the living system, or eyes.
There are many different eye structures, which vary in complexity according to the requirements of the body.
Different constructions have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different levels of acuity, and also require different processing to give meaning to the incoming stimulus and different numbers to work optimally.
A population is the set of organisms of a particular species in a given geographical area.
All individuals in a population who share a particular phenotypic characteristic are called monomorphs.
Individuals showing different variants of a particular trait are polymorphic.
The colonies of legionary ants also leave and build the nest in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, the legionary ants leave at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the available food has been reduced. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these gears or parades last approximately 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin "cella", meaning "small room", and was first used by a microscopist when observing the structure of the cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
The cells are so basic and essential in the study of life that in fact they are often called "life bricks".
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep blood flow functioning and unchanged.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly through the body that they help keep you safe from any potential threat.
Tornadoes hit a small area compared to the other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their wake.
The tornadoes pluck trees, break the joints of the buildings, and throw cars up. Two percent of the most violent tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monstrous storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have manufactured and worn magnifying lenses for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first true telescopes were manufactured in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us, and the nature of collaboration lies in the fact that when most benefit from something, there will always be more to win in the short term by acting in a selfish way.
Hopefully, most people will realize that the best long-term option is to work together with each other.
Many people dream of the day that humans will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what is out there, some believe that aliens or that you can find lives on another plant.
But if that happens, it probably won't happen for long. The stars are very scattered, there are trillions of kilometers of separation between "neighbors" stars.
Maybe one day, your great-grandchildren will stand on an alien world by reflecting on their ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (although not all of them have them; jellyfish, for example, do not have one).
There are animals everywhere on Earth. They dig on earth, swim in the oceans and fly to the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small room.
If you look at living beings under a microscope, you will realize that they are made up of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, observed small squares of cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in the gaseous state still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules remain the same.
Water is another example. Composed water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure well in solid state, liquid than gaseous.
Although its physical condition may change, its chemical composition does not vary.
Time is something that surrounds us everywhere and that affects everything we do, and yet it is difficult to understand.
Religious, philosophical and scientific scholars have studied time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that go through the present through the past from the future.
Time also consists of the comparison we make of the (long) duration of events.
You can mark the passage of time by yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly.
Today's computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
You can build sophisticated animations with computers, and this animation caste is increasingly used in television and movies.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and combine sounds.
For a long time in the nineteen and twenty centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Māori, giant bird hunters called Moas.
Then the theory established the concept that the Māori had migrated from Polynesia to a Great Fleet and took New Zealand to the Morori, establishing a farming society there.
However, there is new evidence to suggest that the Moori were a group of Māori from the continent who emigrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, where they developed a distinct and peaceful culture.
There is also another tribe in the Chatham Islands; they were Māori who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Morori, there were a few fights and in the end, the Morori were annihilated
The people who have been involved for a few decades have helped us appreciate our strengths and passions, while openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
While listening to people who shared personal, family and organizational stories, we have understood about the past and some of the personalities that have influenced for better or for worse in the culture of the organization.
Although understanding the history of oneself does not mean that culture is understood, at least it helps people to get an idea of where they find in the history of the organization.
While confirming the successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and the group of participants more deeply discover the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, remembering past experiences of entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting achievements helped people stay open to new changes and the new direction of the place church.
Such success stories diminished fears of change, creating a positive vision of change in the future.
Convergent thinking patterns are problem-solving techniques that unite different ideas or fields to find a solution.
The focus of this mentality is speed, logic and precision, also the identification of facts, reapplying existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, that is, correct or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific procedures or standards.
People with this caste of thought have logical thinking, can memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific evidence.
Humans are by far the most gifted species to read the minds of others.
This implies that we can satisfactorily predict what other humans perceive, pretend, believe, know or desire.
Among these skills, it is essential to understand the intentions of others. This allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window of a car, you'll probably take it for granted that you're trying to steal someone else's car.
He would have to be tried differently if he had lost his car keys and the vehicle he was trying to force would have been his.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR), and discovered in the 1930s Felix Bloch (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
In 1970 Raymond Damadian, a doctor and research assistant, discovered the basis for using MRI scanning as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world to be given in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "full-body" magnetic resonance imaging scanner, which he named the Indomible. 
Asynchronous communication favors time for reflection and reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace and to control the rhythm of instructional information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of making working hours more flexible. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows students to have access to information all the time.
Instead of waiting until the next face-to-face meeting, students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of the day and wait for reasonably quick answers.
The postmodern approach to learning offers the freedom of absolutes. There is no good way to learn.
In fact, there is nothing worth learning. Learning takes place in the experience between the student and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all TV shows based on "do it yourself" and on the information it presents, illustrate this point.
Many of us find ourselves watching a television program that informs us about a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply the knowledge.
We will never check a car, build a fountain in the backyard of our house, travel to Peru to contemplate old ruins or remodel our neighbor's house.
Thanks to connections via underwater fiber optic threads with Europe and a broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population with internet access.
Your hotel or host (if you stay in a boarding house or a private home) will probably have wifi or a computer connected to the Internet, and all settlements will have an internet cafe or some location with public wifi.
As mentioned above, although the word "Eskimo" is still valid in the United States, many Arctic peoples who do not belong to the U.S. consider it offensive, mainly in Canada.
Although you can hear natives of Greenland using the word, foreigners should avoid using it.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and kalaalleq (plural kalaallit), a Greenlandic one, in Greenland.
Crime and ill-will towards foreigners in general hardly exist Greenland. There are not even "dangerous zones" in cities.
Cold weather is possibly the only real danger that the unprepared will face.
If you visit Greenland during the cold seasons (bearing in mind that the further north you go, the colder it will be), it is essential to wear enough warm clothes.
Extremely long summer days can lead to trouble sleeping long and associated health problems.
In summer, also be careful with Nordic mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit any disease, they can be irritating.
Although the economy of San Francisco has a lot to do with being a tourist attraction on a global scale, its economy is diversified.
The most extensive employment sectors are professional services, administration, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent representation in music, films, literature and popular culture have helped make the city and its benchmarks recognized around the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and first-class convention centers.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country to enjoy other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
We can say that taking a trip to the Walt Disney World park is a real pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit consists of flying to Orlando International Airport, traveling by coach to a Disney hotel, spending a week without leaving Disney facilities and returning home.
There's an infinite variety of possibilities, but that's what most people mean when they talk about "going to Disneyland."
Many of the tickets sold online through auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day tickets.
Despite being a very common activity, it is prohibited by Disney: tickets are non-transferable.
You must have an excursion permit to be able to camp below the edge of the Gran Canyó.
Permits are limited to protect the ravine, and are available on the first day of the month, four months before the start of the month.
Thus, a field permit for any May date will be available on January 1.
The spaces in the best-known areas, such as the Bright Angel Camp adjacent to the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with applications received on the first day on which reservations are open.
There are a limited number of permissions reserved for requests for access on foot, available for those who arrive first.
Entering South Africa by car is an impressive way to see all the beauty of the region and to reach places outside the most common tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning. However, it is advisable to use a 4x4 and, in fact, many locations are only accessible with a 4x4 high wheel.
Keep in mind, during planning, that although southern Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and depend on your home country.
In addition, each country has specific laws describing which emergency objects to carry in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Zimbabwe, along the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is immediately located next to the waterfalls, and they are the main attraction, but this well-known tourist destination offers hikers and adventurers many opportunities for a longer stay.
When the rainy season arrives (from November to March), the volume of water will rise and the waterfalls will be more spectacular.
It is certain that you will get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the winding trails near the Falls.
On the other hand, precisely because the volume of water is so high your views of the waterfalls will be covered  by all the water!
The Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of the valley tombs, Howard Carter's 1922 discovery scene of the young king's royal tomb almost intact.
Compared to most other royal tombs, even so, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller and with limited decoration.
Anyone interested in seeing the samples of damage from the mummy caused by the multiple attempts to remove it from the sarcophagus will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders can be seen.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer inside, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
It would be better if visitors who have little time spend it somewhere else.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple on top of a mountain was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The climb to the peaks is worth it thanks to the gloomy atmosphere of the temple and its views towards Lake Tonle Sap.
A visit to this place can be conveniently combined with a trip to the lake by boat.
You need the Angkor pass to be able to enter the temple, so do not forget to carry your passport when you go to Tonlé Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although neither most countries nor the United Nations recognize it as the country's capital.
The ancient city on the Hills of Judea has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.
The city is sacred to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Because of the religious significance of the city, and in particular of many places in the area of the Ancient City, Jerusalem is one of Israel's greatest tourist attractions.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural attractions, as well as shopping centers, cafes and restaurants of the most lively and crowded.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to have received a letter of invitation before entering Ecuador through international airports or border admissions points.
This letter must be certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meet certain requirements.
The aim of these requirements is to provide an organized migratory flow between both countries.
Cuban citizens who have a U.S. green card must visit the Ecuadorian Consulate to obtain an exemption to this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the dates of the trip. A closed/round trip ticket is required to prove the duration of the stay.
Visits are cheaper for larger groups, so if you find yourself alone or just with a friend, try to get together with other people and form a group of four to six for a better price per person.
However, this should not worry you much, because tourists often combine to fill cars.
It actually seems more like a technique to make people believe that they have to pay more.
Imposing on the northern head of Machu Picchu is this mountain, often the backdrop of many photographs of the ruins.
It seems a little imposing from below and is a steep and difficult climb, but most minimally fit people should be able to do it in about 45 minutes.
The stone stairs are placed along most of the way, and in the sections with more slope there are steel cables to hold.
That said, wait for you to run out of breath, and be careful in the steepest segments, especially if there is moisture, because it can become dangerous quickly.
Near the summit there is a tiny cave that must be crossed; it is quite low and narrow.
The places and wildlife of the Galapagos are best observed by boat, just as Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail through the waters of the Galapagos, with capacities of between 8 and 100 passengers.
Most visitors book their place well in advance, as the boats are usually full during the high season.
Be sure that the agent that makes the reservation is a specialist of the Galapagos with a good knowledge of a wide variety of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests or limitations are tailored to the most suitable ship.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule, while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche) populated central and southern Chile.
The Mapuches were also one of the last indigenous American groups not fully absorbed by Spanish-speaking regulation after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Peninsular War, which left Spain without a functional central government for two years), it did not obtain a decisive victory against the Spanish until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
The country houses, in addition to the white sand beaches and mountainous landscapes, the oldest European city in America, today part of Santo Domingo.
The island was initially inhabited by the Taínos and the Galibians. The Galibians were a people who spoke Arauac who had arrived around 10,000 BC.
A few years after the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish conquerors reduced the population of Taïnos significantly.
According to Fra Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies), between 1492 and 1498 the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taínos.
Garden of the Union. This space was built as a cloister of a 17th century convent, of which the Temple of San Diego is the only building that has survived.
Now it works as a central square and a lot of things always happen, both day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden, and in the afternoon and evening there are free concerts, often held in the central gazebo.
Callejón del Beso (Alley of the kiss). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters that are the origin of an ancient legend of love.
For a few cents some children will tell you the story.
The Bowen Island is a one-day walk or popular weekend excursion, offering kayaking, hiking, shopping, restaurants and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound, next to Vancouver, and can be easily accessed by scheduled water taxis departing from the island of Granville in central Vancouver.
For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a walk through the Sea to Sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but is recognized for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter enjoy the best skiing in North America, and in summer try some authentic mountain biking.
Permits must be reserved in advance. You must have a permit to spend the night in Sirena.
Sirena is the only forest ranger station that offers accommodation in bedrooms and meals in addition to the campsite. La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos only offer camping, without food service.
Parking permits can be reserved directly at the Puerto Jiménez forest guard station, but they do not accept credit cards.
The park service (MINAE) does not grant access permits more than one month before arrival.
Cafenet El Sol offers a booking service for 30 US dollars or 10 dollars for one-day passes. For more information, visit their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are a freely associated island state in New Zealand, and are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million km2 of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as "Hawaii of Oceania."
Although smaller, some older visitors are reminded of Hawaii before it became a state, without the large tourist hotels and other constructions.
There is no city in the Cook Islands, and there are 15 islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, the offer of luxury bed and breakfast in developed countries has become almost an art form.
At the upper end, the B&Bs compete obviously mostly in two main things: bed and breakfast.
Consequently, you can find in these establishments the most luxurious sheets, perhaps a hand-woven vana or an old bed.
Breakfast may include regional seasonal delights or the host's specialty.
The setting can be a historic building with antique furniture, well-healed grounds and a swimming pool.
Getting in the car and starting a long road trip has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you have probably already become familiar with driving your car and you know the limitations.
Installing a tent on a private property or in a village of any size can easily attract attention in an unwanted way.
To sum up, the car is a very good option to take a road trip, but in itself it is not usually a form of "camping".
The car camping is feasible if you have a van, a saloon, a utilitarian sports vehicle or a large berc with inclinable seats.
Some hotels have a legacy of the golden age of steam trains and transatlantics; before World War II, in the 19th century or the early 20th century.
These hotels were where the rich and famous of the time stayed, and often had good food and nightlife.
Vintage accessories, lack of modern comforts and a certain elegant aging are also part of your character.
Although they are usually private property, they sometimes host visits from heads of state and other dignitaries.
A traveler with a lot of money could consider going around the world by plane, with breaks to stay in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is the organization that connects travelers with neighbors in the cities they are going to visit.
To join such an atypical network, you usually only need to fill out a questionnaire, although some networks offer or ask for additional verification.
A list of hosts is then offered either in print or online, sometimes with quotes and reviews from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after programmer Casey Fenton found an economic flight to Iceland, but had nowhere to stay.
He wrote emails to the students of the site's college and received an overwhelming number of free hosting offers.
Hostels are usually aimed at a young audience - a typical guest is twenty years old - but you can often also find older travelers.
Families with children are rare to see, but hotels let them stay in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will be the host city of the Winter Olympics in 2022, which will make it the first city to have hosted both the summer and winter games.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as ice events in enclosed spaces.
Other ski events will take place in the ski area of Taizicheng in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual festival that begins between the end of November and the middle of May, and varies according to the annual calendar of each temple.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple's birthday or the birthday of the deity he chairs or any other event associated with the temple.
It is very interesting to see the festivals of the Temple of Kerala; there are periodic processions of endomised elephants, a temple orchestra and other festivities.
A World Fair (often called the World Exhibition, or simply Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
The participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to expose the problems of the world or the culture and history of their country.
The International Horticultural Exhibitions are specialized events that exhibit floral showcases, botanical gardens and anything else related to plants.
Although in theory they are celebrated every year (as long as it is in different countries), in practice they are not.
These events typically last between three and six months, and are held in places not smaller than 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. The most common by far is standard 35 mm film (negative 36 by 24 mm).
It can usually be replenished easily enough if it is finished, and offers a resolution comparable to the current DSLRs.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 by 6 cm, plus a negative of 56 by 56 mm.
This gives us a resolution almost four times higher than that of a negative of 35 mm (3,136 mm2 instead of 864).
Wildlife is one of the most challenging reasons for a photographer, and requires a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is sometimes taken as guaranteed, but since photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, even so, things like a flock of birds or a tiny creature need other targets.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find and sometimes parks have rules when taking photographs with commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be embarrassing or aggressive. The environment may be cold, warm, or hostile.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty with 50 million speakers or more.
Written words are usually easier to understand than spoken words, too. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligiblely.
There are many nations where fluent English is spoken throughout the territory, and many others can expect limited knowledge, especially among young people.
Imagine, please, one from Manchester, one from Boston, one from Jamaica and one from Sydney sitting around a table at a restaurant in Toronto.
They delight each other with stories from their hometowns, told with their different accents and local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. However, if it is not possible to cook, the options are limited to pre-cooked food.
Supermarkets are increasingly offering more varied food prepared. Some even offer a microwave or other means to heat the dishes.
In some countries or types of shops there is at least one restaurant, often rather informal with affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and the insurer's contact information, and carry them.
These must contain data from the insurer such as email address and telephone numbers to call from abroad and thus obtain directions/authorizations and also make claims.
Keep another copy in your luggage and online (send yourself an email with the attachment, or save it to the cloud).
If you travel with a laptop or tablet, save a copy to your memory or disk (which can be accessed without the Internet).
It also delivers copies of the policy/contact to fellow travelers and relatives or friends who are willing to help.
The moose (also known as elk) are not inherently aggressive, but will defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
When people don't see their moose as potentially dangerous animals, they tend to get too close and, consequently, can put themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is very important that you know your own limit.
The possible health effects of excessive, long-term drinking may include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger increases when you consume alcohol produced illegally.
Illegal liquors can contain several dangerous impurities such as methanol, which can lead to blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in a foreign country, especially in low-priced countries where production costs are lower.
Consider taking an eye exam at home, especially if the insurance covers you, and bring the recipe to fill it in anywhere else.
The mounts of luxury brands available in these areas can have two problems: some can be imitations, and the really imported ones can be more expensive than not at home.
Coffee is one of the most commercialized commodities in the world, and you can possibly find many varieties in your region.
However, there are many different ways to drink coffee around the planet that are worth trying.
Canyoning consists of reaching the bottom of a ravine, which can be dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping, but requires relatively little training or fitness to start (compared to mountain climbing, diving or alpine skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves walking in natural environments, often on hiking trails.
Day hiking involves distances of less than a mile up to longer distances that can be done in a single day.
For a day trip down a simple path you need little preparation, and anyone moderately fit can join.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but one day outside it is easily achievable with babies or preschool children.
Internationally, there are almost 200 tourism organizations in operation. Most of them operate independently.
The successor to Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, connects dozens of outdoor runner providers to four continents.
With roots in the Running Tours Barcelona in Barcelona and the Running Copenhagen in Copenhagen, they quickly joined the Running Tours Prague based in Prague and others.
There are many things you need to keep in mind before and during a trip anywhere.
When you travel, don't expect things to be "like home." The fashions, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language and others will be, to some extent, different from where you live.
This is something that must always be taken into account, to avoid a disappointment or perhaps even aversion to local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond the previous experience of travel with nature, culture, language or low-profit countries.
Although most agencies are willing to accept more general bookings, many specialize in certain types of specific trips, budget ranges or destinations.
It may be convenient to use an agent who often books trips similar to yours.
Take a look at the trips promoted by the agent, either on the website, or in the office window.
If you want to see the world with little money, whether out of necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are several ways to do it.
Basically, they are divided into two categories: either work during the trip or try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the second option.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to lower costs by about zero, see travel with minimal budget.
The council assumes that travelers do not steal, or transgress, or participate in the illegal market, or beg, and do not exploit other people for their own gain.
Normally, the first stop after disembarking from a plane, boat or other vehicle is an immigration checkpoint.
On some trains crossing borders, inspections are carried out while the train is running and you must have a valid identity document when boarding one of these.
The driver can pick up passports on night trains so they don't have to interrupt sleep.
Registering is an additional requirement for the visa process. In certain countries, you must register your presence and address where you are staying with the local authorities.
To achieve this, you may need to fill out a form with the local police or visit the immigration offices.
In many countries with a law like this, local hotels will take care of registration (be sure to ask).
In other cases, only those who do not stay in tourist accommodation must be registered. Now, this makes the law much more obscure, so you have to find out in advance.
Architecture deals with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is usually a tourist attraction by itself.
Many constructions are beautiful enough to see, and the panorama from a tall building or from a well-located window can be of great beauty.
Architecture coincides significantly with other fields such as urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given the great distance that there is to many of the "pueblos", you will not find much nightlife unless you visit Albuquerque or Santa Fe. 
However, almost all the casinos mentioned above serve drinks, and many of them offer first-class entertainment (especially the largest, in the vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Watch out: the bars in the small villages here are not always a good place for visitors from other states.
For some reason, the north of New Mexico has significant problems with drunk drivers, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near the bars of small towns.
The murals or doodles that are made without anyone requesting it are called graffiti.
Despite not being at all a modern phenomenon, most people associate it with young people who damage public and private property using spray paint.
However, today there are renowned artists, graffiti-related events and "legal" walls. Graphite works in this context often have more works of art than illegible scribbles.
The launch of boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists try to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back to your hand, make sure you have one of those that returns.
Most of the boomerangs available in Australia are, in fact, boomerangs that do not return. It is better that beginners do not try to throw them with wind
A Hangi meal is cooked in a hot hole in the ground.
The hole is heated with hot stones from a fire or in some places geothermal heat creates natural areas of hot earth.
Hangi is often used to cook a roasted meal in the traditional way.
Many sites in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while you can take other hangi in Christchurch, Wellington and anywhere else.
MetroRail has two classes of suburban trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but it's a little more expensive, although it's still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
All trains have Metro and MetroPlus wagons; MetroPlus wagons are always at the end of the nearest train to Cape Town.
Bringing other people's things - never lose sight of your bags, especially when crossing international borders.
You may find yourself being used as drug carriers without knowing it, which would bring you a lot of problems.
This includes waiting for queueing, since dogs that smell the drug could be used at any time without warning.
Some countries have excessively severe punishments even for early crimes; they may involve prison sentences of more than ten years or death.
Neglected suitcases are a target for thieves and can also draw the attention of the wary authorities with bomb threats.
At home, due to this constant exposure to local germs, it is very likely that you are already immune to it.
But in places in the world, where bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to have problems.
In addition, in warmer climates the bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Hence travelers' diarrheas such as "the Delhi stomach", "the curse of the pharaoh", the "vengeance of Moctezuma" and many other variants.
As with respiratory problems in cold climates, intestinal problems in warm climates are quite common and in most cases are annoying but not really dangerous.
If you travel to a developing country (or a new part of the world) for the first time, do not underestimate the potential cultural shock.
Many veteran and experienced travelers have been overwhelmed by developments in traveling to developing countries, where there are many small cultural adjustments that accumulate quickly.
Especially your first days, consider spending money on hotels, food and quality Western-style services to help you acclimatize.
Do not sleep on a mattress or mat on the floor of an area where you do not know the local fauna.
If you plan to camp outdoors, bring a camping boat or a hammock to keep you away from snakes, scorpions and other similar wildlife.
Fill your house with a rich morning coffee and a little relaxing chamomile in the evening.
When you are at your holiday home, you have time to enjoy and spend a few extra minutes preparing something special.
If you are called the adventure, do not miss the opportunity to squeeze or mix some fruit juices:
You may discover a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you return to your usual routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in the neighborhoods you don't normally visit.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, infectious and contagious words have different meanings.
An infectious disease is caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when it is near an infected person.
Many governments require that visitors entering or residents leaving their countries be vaccinated for a number of diseases.
Often these requirements depend on the countries that the traveler has visited previously or intends to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte, North Carolina, is its high number of high-quality options for families.
Residents of other areas often mention sympathy for families as the main reason for moving to it, and visitors often find it easy to enjoy the city with children.
In the past 20 years the number of child-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has increased exponentially.
Families do not usually use taxis in Charlotte, although they may be useful in certain cases.
There is a surcharge for having more than two passengers, so this option can be more expensive than the account.
Antarctica is the coldest area on Earth, and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require being in good shape, and can only be done in summer, between November and February, and are very limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
A couple of thousand employees live here during the summer in about four dozen bases mostly in those areas; a small number stay there during the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered by 2 to 3 km of ice.
From time to time there are specialized air routes that go inland, to practice mountaineering or reach the Pole, where there is a very large base.
The South Pole Crossing (or Highway) is a 1600 km trail from McMurdo station in the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It is compacted snow with fissures filled and marked with flags. It can only be traversed on specialized tractors, which drag sleds with fuel and supplies.
They are not very agile, so the road has to make a long journey around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter are roads, pavements (sidewalks) and especially slippery steps.
At the bottom, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material soft enough in cold temperatures.
Some boots have heels and there are accessories with heels for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes or boots, for heels or for sole and heel.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or paths to improve their traction.
Avalanches are not an extraordinary fact; pronounced slopes only admit a certain amount of snow, and an excess volume precipitates in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that the snow is sticky, so you need a push to go down and some snow that goes down can serve as a push for the rest.
Sometimes the triggering event is the sun that warms the snow, sometimes it's snowier, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
A tornado is a rotating column of air at very low pressure, which sucks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can raise heavy objects up, transporting them so the tornado moves.
They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become "tornadoes" when they touch the ground.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to avoid both political censorship and commercial IP geo-filtering.
These are better than web proxies for different reasons: for example, they are not limited to redirecting https but do so with all internet traffic.
They usually offer superior bandwidth and better quality service. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
Multimedia companies lie time and time again about the goal of this action, claiming that it is done to "prevent piracy."
In fact, regional codes have no effect on illegal copies; a bit-per-bit copy of a disk is played equally well on any device on which the original can be played.
The current purpose is to offer greater control to these companies over their markets; it is about generating money.
Since calls are directed over the internet, you don't need to have a phone company located where you live or where you travel.
You also don't need a local community number where you live; you can get a satellite internet connection in the most desolate regions of Chicken, Alaska and select a number that claims you're under the Arizona sun.
Often, you need to purchase a separate global number to allow XTC phones to call you. The origin of the telephone number causes a difference for people who call you.
Real-time text translation applications – applications that can automatically translate entire text snippets from one language to another.
Some applications within this category may even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other real-world objects when the user directs the smartphone towards those objects.
Translation engines have improved dramatically, and today they usually offer more or less correct translations (and less and less gibberish), but you always have to pay attention to them, because they can still be wrong.
One of the most prominent applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows you to translate offline once the desired language data is downloaded.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate outside your home country.
You can save money by buying new maps for a GPS or a separate GPS device or rent one to a rental car company.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or if you lack coverage, your performance may be limited or void.
All grocery stores have a confusing multitude of prepaid phone cards that can be used for both payment phones and normal phones.
Although most cards are valid for calling anywhere, some specialize in offering convenient call rates to groups of specific countries.
These services are usually accessed through a toll-free phone number that can be called from most phones without having to pay.
The rules on normal photography also apply to video recording, even more so.
If the simple fact of taking a photo of something is forbidden, you have to get out of your head the idea of making a video of it.
When using a drone, verify with enough margin that you are authorized to register and what additional permits or licenses you need.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, it is very rare to make flight bookings directly with the airline, without searching and comparing prices before.
Sometimes the same flight can have very variable prices on different content readers and it is worth comparing search results and taking a look at the company's own website before booking.
Although you may not need a visa for short visits, to do tourism or business in certain countries, going there as an international student usually requires a longer stay than going there like an occasional tourist.
You usually need to get a visa in advance to stay in any foreign country for a long period.
Student visas usually require requirements and application procedures other than normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you need a letter of offer from the institution in which you want to study, and also sufficient resource tests so that you can stay for at least your first year of the course.
Verify the specific requirements with the institution and with the immigration department of the country in which you want to study.
Unless you're a diplomat, working abroad usually involves having to pay income taxes in the country where you reside.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and supports vary quite a lot from country to country.
In some federal countries, as well as in the United States and Canada, income tax is received both at the federal and local level, thus, rates and supports may vary from region to region.
Although immigration control is usually absent or a formality when you return to your country, customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure you find out what you can bring and what you can't, and declare anything that exceeds the legal limit.
The easiest way to get started in the travel writing business is to polish one's own skill in a consolidated travel blog.
Once you've become familiar with the format and editing of the website, then you can create your own site.
Volunteering while traveling is a very good way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a very good way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, achieve a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to extend a budget to be able to extend the stay somewhere, since many volunteer jobs are offered with full board and in some a small salary is paid.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some parts of these routes can still be used. Review possible special permit requirements, which can be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Sea channel links the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea, through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mostly through rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so you can still reach the Caspian Sea through Russia.
Be sure that once you enter the marina everything will be very obvious. You will meet other ship hitchhikers and share their information with you.
Basically, you will hang ads offering your help, turning to the docks, approaching people who clean their yachts, trying to make contacts with sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will meet you and let you know and give you advice such as which boat someone is looking for.
You should carefully choose your Frequent Traveler company in an alliance.
Although it may be logical to join the airline with which it flies most often, it should be borne in mind that the privileges they offer are usually different and that other airlines within the same alliance can give more frequent traveler points.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly increased their services in Africa, and offer connections to most large African cities at more competitive prices than other European companies.
Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries since 2014.
If you have plenty of time to travel, calculate how much the trip to Africa costs you compared to a round the world trip.
Do not forget to count the extra expenses of additional visas, travel fees, ground transport, etc. for all places outside Africa.
If you want to travel around the world flying entirely through the southern hemisphere, the flight and destination options are limited by the lack of transoceanic routes.
There is no air alliance that crosses the three oceans of the southern hemisphere (and Skyteam does not cover any of the three).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a flight from LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to ignore the South Pacific and the western coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, Azerbaijan's Armenian-ethnic region of Nagorno-Karabakh rose at war against the Azerbaijanis.
With the support of the Armenians, a new republic was created. Even so, there is no established nation that officially recognises this - not even Armenia.
Diplomatic discussions about the region continue to undermine the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century neighbourhood that surrounds the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.
The entire neighborhood has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique historical and cultural value, and the value of its properties is among the highest in the country.
The Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands, comprise the five coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built rows of houses attached to the rugged and abrupt landscape to the cliffs facing the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of construction by man. Roads, trains and boats connect villages and cars cannot reach them.
The variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from the French spoken in France. Still, these are sufficiently similar variants, so they are mutually intelligible.
Specifically, the numbering system in the French-speaking territories of Belgium and Switzerland has a number of small peculiarities that differentiate it from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of certain words is somewhat different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned French in school, so they would be able to understand it even if the standard French numeral system were used.
In many parts of the world, moving your hand is a friendly gesture that means "hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malaysians of rural areas, it means "come here", similar to the gesture of the index finger pointing to the body itself that is used in some Western countries, and should only be used for this purpose.
In the same way, a British traveler in Spain can confuse a greeting with the palm looking at the sender (instead of the person receiving the greeting) with a gesture to go back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the aim of facilitating communication between people who would otherwise have communication difficulties.
These are separated from the Frankish languages, which are natural or organic languages that, for different reasons, acquire dominance as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
Travelers can see mirages that generate an illusion of water (or other things) with daytime heat.
This can be dangerous if the traveler chases the mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the warmest desert can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothing.
In summer, especially, you will have to be alert with mosquitoes if you decide to make a route through the rainforest.
Even if you drive through the subtropical jungle, with a few seconds with the doors open while you enter the vehicle, it is enough for mosquitoes to enter with you.
Bird flu, or more formally bird flu, can infect birds and mammals.
In humans fewer than a thousand cases have been detailed, but some have turned out to be fatal.
In most cases these are people who work with poultry, but there is also some risk for birdwatchers.
Typical for Norway are the steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a plateau, more or less high.
These plateaus are often called "video", which means space with spaciousness, open and that has no trees, that is, an unlimited extension.
Rogaland and Agder are often called "hei", which refers to a treeless wasteland and often covered in heather.
Glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain. This will cause cracks, cracks, which can be hidden with snow bridges.
It is possible that the walls and ceilings of the ice caves will sink and the cracks may be closed.
On the edges of glaciers there are large blocks that break, fall and sometimes jump or roll outside the edge.
The tourist season of the mountain resorts usually reaches its maximum during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm in winter, when many mountain resorts receive large amounts of snow and offer activities such as skiing or snowboarding.
There are few airlines that still offer bereavement rates, which reduce the cost of a last-minute funeral trip a bit.
Among the companies that offer it are Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights originating in the US or Canada, and WestJet.
In any case, you must book by phone directly with the airline.
